    "content": "<p> Last week, I put a pair of sneakers in my dryer to warm them up before a cold morning run. The rhythmic thump of my shoes hitting the bottom of the dryer drum after cycling up the right side and then being pulled down by gravity got me thinking about economics. Do businesses, credit and the economy expand and contract in a somewhat predictable pattern, just like the huuuuuuuum, thump, huuuuuuuum, thump of my shoes in the dryer? This is the question Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates attempted to answer with a <u>  <a href=\"http://www.economicprinciples.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   thirty-minute animated film  </a> </u> in 2013. The film gathered a lot of attention from finance and non-finance people alike (Bill Gates said the film &ldquo;would help everyone&rdquo; who watched it, and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker said it &ldquo;casts strong light on how the economy actually works&rdquo;). In simplistic terms, the film tells us that when investors borrow money, they are borrowing from themselves in the future. If you borrow $10,000 now and spend it on college tuition, after graduation you will need to decrease spending to pay back the $10,000 (plus the cost of money, interest). Increase, decrease, increase, decrease, just like my shoes in the dryer. If we aggregate everyone together &ndash; collectively, &ldquo;the economy&rdquo; &ndash; Dalio argues/explains that broader trends exist: people and businesses tend to increase and decrease spending and borrowing simultaneously. Figuring out where we are in the cycle can be worthwhile. If a money manager suspects a recession is coming in the next twelve months, for instance, she might load up on safe Treasury bonds before everyone else does. But answering the question &ldquo;where are we in the economic cycle?&rdquo; turns out to be tough. Recent research from Goldman Sachs, however, takes a stab at it.</p><p> Using a model of fifteen economic variables (employment, manufacturing, equity market levels, etc.), Goldman says we are still in the early stages of the economic cycle. My shoes are just barely making their way up the dryer drum, they argue, and surely we have a long way to go before the thump (Goldman gives us just a 5% probability of recession in the next six months). Underlying their assessment of our location in the cycle are labor market slack, subdued inflation and monetary policy consistent with &ldquo;easing.&rdquo; However, Goldman warns we may be crossing over into mid-cycle soon. Early- and mid-cycle are pretty similar qualitatively, they write, but we can expect employment slack to tighten even further, inflation to pick up slightly and, perhaps most importantly for fixed income investors, the interest rate curve to begin to flatten, led by the front end rising. Assuming Goldman&rsquo;s assessment of both our location in the economic cycle and the probability of recession are correct, this seems like a dire prognosis for bonds, but our research suggests otherwise. Investors expose their principle to interest and credit risk when buying and holding bonds, but also accrue income daily, a concept popularly called &ldquo;carry.&rdquo; Our research suggests the total return in portfolios with lower average maturity profiles are more dependent on carry than on shifts in interest rates. It might actually cost you more to make the wager that interest rates will rise in terms of foregone carry, on the order of ten to forty basis points per year for short portfolios, than you might make should your bet prove correct. With the concept of carry in mind, fixed income is a powerful portfolio diversifier, and, regardless of where we are in the cycle, close to the thump or far from it, the risk of significant capital erosion from well-positioned bond portfolio is minimal.</p><p> Sources: Bidgewater Associates, Goldman Sachs, SNWAM Research</p>",

    "content": "<p> Digital media. It&rsquo;s everywhere. Between our searches on Google, videos on YouTube, friends and connections on Facebook and LinkedIn, the people we follow on Twitter, the images and ideas we collect on Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, Vine and others, we can connect 24/7 using our computers, tablets and smartphones.</p><p> The thing is, this breathtaking volume of messages and images has distracted us from the real thing, the powerful experience of connecting with people in person, in the moment.</p><p> Look up. If you&rsquo;re reading this in a public space, I&rsquo;d bet that many (if not most) of the people surrounding you are looking at a device right now, just like you. Even people seated at tables with others may be gazing at their iPhone instead of engaging with one another.</p><p> Please don&rsquo;t mistake me for a curmudgeon. These new tools of expression are a blessing to mankind. They empower us to connect with friends and colleagues who before social media would have fallen away. Social media have also demonstrated an unparalleled ability to organize and inspire people to effect important social change.</p><p> For most of my career as a marketer and communicator, I have worked in the financial services industry. It&rsquo;s a sophisticated industry that spends a lot on marketing, but because it is vigorously regulated most firms &ndash; mine included &ndash; were slow to fully embrace digital, especially social media, as a marketing and communications platform with legitimate business building implications.</p><p> To be honest, we were missing the boat. To this day, many financial firms are still missing the boat.</p><p> Early on, I knew I needed to be able to develop effective integrated digital strategies that included social media, so when social really started taking off, I dedicated as much time as I could to getting educated in the discipline.</p><p> I have learned a lot, especially that I can never be done learning. Digital is as diverse and changeable as any media I have ever encountered. This blog is part of my effort to better understand and one day master digital marketing. It is a burgeoning field, with experts abounding in search engine optimization, search engine marketing, content development, inbound marketing, copywriting, blogging, lead generation, lead nurturing, you get it&hellip;</p><p> By now, you know that you are going to be marketed to anywhere and everywhere you go. There are ads on the shopping cart at the grocery store, in public restrooms, in your email box, and even at the movies (that one still ticks me off). So most of us have gotten accustomed to seeing the ads that line up next to, or run before, what we really want to see when we are online.</p><p> The technology that powers Google, Facebook and others gives these platforms deep insights into your interests. By tracking what you search for, who and what you like and what you buy, they can deliver marketing messages that are specifically designed for people just like you. As a result, you&rsquo;re more likely to take action (buy something or at least take a closer look) than a more random message would prompt.</p><p> The other side of this transaction is digital&rsquo;s inherent measurability. When you click, digital marketers know. There is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between marketing and response that other media cannot match.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s wrong with all this? Nothing really. At the same time that we&rsquo;re connecting with friends, colleagues and customers and being entertained, we&rsquo;re also getting marketing messages that are way better suited to our lifestyles. We&rsquo;re being pitched stuff we actually care about, and the companies that are doing the pitching have a better idea for how their marketing investments are paying off. Better in fact than at any time in history. Everything&rsquo;s jiggy, right?</p><p> Well, yes. Mostly.</p><p> A couple of years ago, I was driving through a remote part of rural Montana, and the only radio station I could find was an AM station broadcasting from a tiny town at least a hundred miles away. For an hour or so, I listened to songs from artists that (I swear) included Frank Sinatra, AC-DC, George Jones, The Supremes, and more current stuff from the likes of Maroon Five and Tim McGraw. I heard music I would never have heard, and most of it was good. Damn good.</p><p> That experience got me thinking about the virtues of the unexpected. When I confine myself to a certain type of music, or food, or art, or to communities defined by a common (often narrow) set of interests, I miss some great things. By allowing myself to be immersed in a digital world designed to deliver exactly what I like today, I risk missing some great, unexpected thing that I might be passionate about tomorrow.</p><p> One of the things I love about our neighborhood is the openness of our neighbors. Unlike other areas in the city, where people avoid eye contact and keep their ear buds and earphones tightly in place, we and our neighbors readily engage. On evening walks, my wife and I have had wonderful, surprising conversations with people I now count as friends, people I would ordinarily never meet. They bring experiences and outlooks utterly unlike my own and I&rsquo;m richer for it.</p><p> So here&rsquo;s what I am doing so I don&rsquo;t get stuck in a digital or psychic rut. If any of these tactics resonate with you, I hope you&rsquo;ll join along or find a method that does the trick for you.</p><li> I am reducing my time on social media. The quality of the discourse there doesn&rsquo;t come close to direct communications between people. Whenever I can, I will spend time face to face, followed by phone, then email, then social.</li><li> I&rsquo;m keeping my head up and my eyes and mind open &ndash; signaling to the world that I am interested in knowing the people around be better. When I can help them, I want to.</li><li> I&rsquo;m going to work harder to experience new things. By connecting with and listening to the people, new and old, whose paths cross mine, I intend to go out of my way to expand my experience and appreciation.</li><p> As a marketing professional, I love digital media. As a fellow human being, I hope my audience is adventurous enough to know that some of the best things out there have never even crossed their minds.</p><p> What role does social media play in your life? How has it made your life better? How have Internet search engines like Google affected your behavior as a consumer? Are the changes all for the better?</p>",

    "content": "<p> So you have something to sell. It could be your business idea, your product or even yourself. In this lab chat I want to teach you how to sell anything to anyone using SCIENCE!</p><p> My team and I have spent months researching. In my body language in sales course, I came across some fascinating science on selling. Check out the snazzy video or read the summary below (but really the video is much more fun AND you get to see me make a fool of myself at the end).</p><p> <strong>  1. Start with a Bang </strong></p><p> Always start with a bang. One study tried to figure out how to increase room service tips for waiters in hotels. They found there was a super easy thing waiters could to increase their tips. All they had to do was start with a positive comment. When hotel guests opened their door, waiters said &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; and gave a positive weather forecast for the day. Just that one positive comment increased their tips by 27%!</p><p> How does this help you? Never start a sales meeting or pitch by talking about bad weather, traffic or being busy. Always begin with a positive comment or anecdote. Great weather, fun weekend plans or a favorite sports team winning a game. That gets you off onto the right foot.</p><p> <strong>  2. Don&rsquo;t Self-Sabotage </strong></p><p> The biggest self-sabotage mistake is to speak ill of a competitor. Research has found something called Spontaneous Trait Transference. They found that whenever you say bad things about someone else people can&rsquo;t help but put those same traits on you. The brain can&rsquo;t help but associate your gossip with you, even if logically we know you are talking about another person. If you say your competitor is low-quality and unreliable, your potential client can&rsquo;t help but associate those traits with you. No matter what, when it comes to gossip, always say &ldquo;no comment&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  3. Use Awesome Labels </strong></p><p> When you assign someone a positive label, like having high intelligence or being a good person, that actually cues them up to live up to that label. In one study about fundraising, the researchers told average donors that they were in fact among the highest donors. Can you guess what happened? Those donors then  did in fact  donate above average. We live up to our positive labels. When you are with a client or potential customer give them genuinely good labels&mdash;I never want you to be fake or manipulative. So be sure to stick to positive truths. You can say, &ldquo;You are one of our best customers&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a pleasure to do business with&rdquo;. In that way, they will actually want to be one of your best customers and try even harder to be a pleasure to do business with.</p><p> <strong>  4. Use Your Body </strong></p><p> Study after study shows that you have to use nonverbal communication to be an effective salesperson. In one study, Sales people who used power body language increased their sales numbers by 56% after only one training. Power body language is super easy to learn. Check out  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/advanced-body-language-sales-training/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this video </a>  to see what I mean.</p><p> <strong>  5. End High </strong></p><p> Lastly, end on a high note. Ok, let me explain a really gross, but fascinating study involving one of my least favorite topics: colonoscopies&hellip;I&rsquo;ve only ever heard one thing about colonoscopies. They are super unpleasant. And doctors know that they have a bad rap. They wanted to do research to find a way to give colonoscopies a better reputation. A little background: a colonoscopy is only a few minutes long, but they are pretty uncomfortable. They found that if they added one minute at the end of the procedure that was pain-free, people remembered the whole experience as more pleasant. In other words, even if it takes a bit longer, ending on a better note makes someone recall the entire experience better. Before someone leaves your pitch, end on a high note. Gift a final perk, offer them a mint, pay them a compliment. It will make the entire time with you even better.</p><p> To watch Vanessa talk more about this, click <strong>  <a href=\"http://youtu.be/blmqKqJ0BMw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    here   </u>  </a> </strong> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://alexpirouz.com.au/author/alexpirouz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alex Pirouz  </a> </u></p><p> Today it seems that no matter what industry you&rsquo;re in, competition is stronger than ever. Every year that passes by industries are becoming more and more overcrowded. Social media, mobility and the information age has created a platform where by customers have the ability to choose from thousands of different companies all over the world before making a purchasing decision.</p><p> To stand out from the crowd and have a good chance to win new business you really need to be &lsquo;The Expert&rsquo; in your field, otherwise, you will get lost in the panic and hype of a chaotic market place.</p><p> While there are many strategies and techniques to help you become an expert one must first understand that it takes time, dedication and an understanding of the process to truly succeed.</p><p> The first and arguably the most important step is market research. Becoming an expert within a particular field has nothing to do with what we think is required and everything to do with the perception of those within the industry.</p><p> This is more formerly known as the outside inside approach. This is the process of asking the market what they want and then delivering exactly that. After all that is what business is all up, delivering a product or service to a target market based on research and study not assumptions.</p><p> You can conduct market research in many different ways through focus groups, online surveys, one on one interviews or group sessions. Once you have the necessary research conducted its then time to build what I call your: Brand Statement.</p><p> This is the process of designing what you stand for, constructing how you would like others to perceive you, researching competitors, identifying your core strengths and passions, creating a point of difference and designing how you would like to best communicate your message.</p><p> Knowing what you stand for and understanding how to best communicate that message builds the path to then go out there and build that image. It&rsquo;s very hard to get to where you want to be if you don&rsquo;t have a map on how to get there.</p><p> This leads us to the next part of the process: Building the brand and getting the message out there. Having gone through the process I have come to understand what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, the following process is what I now recommend to those who want to build their brand:</p><p> <strong>  Industry results: </strong>  Every year industries all around the world are becoming more populated and competitive. Having a proven track record within your industry and the ability to produce results for your clients through your knowledge and skill set is a vital element to becoming an industry expert.</p><p> <strong>  Well-branded clients: </strong>  There is nothing more impressive then seeing well-branded organisations within an individual&rsquo;s client portfolio.</p><p> <strong>  Speaking engagements: </strong>  This is a great way to build your brand, because of the public&rsquo;s perception towards the industry. Public speakers are regarded as experts in their field, experienced professionals, credible and highly sort after individuals.</p><p> <strong>  Associations: </strong>  Every industry has various associations that support and protect the <br/> rights of individuals who work in that industry. Being a member of an industry association is an indication to others that you take your profession, and by extension your career, seriously.</p><p> <strong>  Government associations: </strong>  Most industries are backed by government-funded agencies. Government departments are highly respected by the general public and by working with your industry department you will quickly establish yourself as a trusted <br/> and credible expert.</p><p> <strong>  Media appearances: </strong>  The Media industry plays a very prominent role in our society. Getting media coverage can help produce greater levels of credibility and trust when communicating with customers, new business partners or marketing your services.</p><p> <strong>  Interviews: </strong>  Conducting interviews with top leaders in your field is a great way to boost your credibility and expertise within your industry. This is mainly due to the brand association people make with you and the influential person.</p><p> <strong>  Write a book </strong>  (optional): A book provides potential business partners, journalist and customers with confidence and trust in your knowledge of the topic and gives you an influential competitive edge.</p><p> By this stage of your brand campaign you have successfully designed and built a great presence for yourself as one of the leading experts within your industry.</p><p> While most of the hard work is out of the way, in order to successfully maintain your brand you will need to monitor and manage it on an ongoing basis to ensure it remains consistent, valuable and visible within your industry.</p><p> Sure you can call yourself the &ldquo;best plastic surgeon in Sydney&rdquo; or &ldquo;the best business coach&rdquo; but without managing that brand over time, it will lose its lustre and visibility. In a sense, without brand management, all of your efforts will be for nothing.</p><p> Technology, the economy and the world in general are evolving much too fast for you to leave your brand stagnant. In today&rsquo;s world if you don&rsquo;t manage your brand, someone else will.</p><p> Therefore management of your brand on a consistent base is absolutely crucial to successfully maintaining your presence within your industry.</p>",

In the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/soa/financial-services-legacy-modernization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first installment  </a> </u>  in our Connected Financial Institution whitepaper series, we discussed how aging back office systems, operational effectiveness and open source adoption are driving legacy modernization initiatives across the financial services industry. But the story doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Modernizing <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/integration-solutions/soa/legacy-system-modernization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   legacy systems  </u>    </a> is only the first step in addressing the business imperatives faced by financial institutions.</p><p> The second white paper in the series discusses how firms can unlock, aggregate and share data across the enterprise to address  <u>  data management </u>  shortcomings. Data management initiatives are being driven by three key challenges: the ever-evolving  <u>  regulatory compliance </u>  landscape, deepening customer relationships with a 360 degree view, and improving data driven decision making a/k/a big data.</p><p> <strong>  An Ever Evolving Regulatory Compliance Landscape </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s difficult for technology teams to keep up with an ever evolving and more stringent regulatory compliance landscape placing increased reporting and risk oversight demands on financial services firms around the globe. However, the data required to support regulatory reporting is often siloed in legacy back office systems and line of business-centric databases, using disparate data definitions and technologies. The process of extracting, aggregating, standardizing and reconciling data for compliance purposes increases the risk of poor data quality and inaccurate reporting, which can spell trouble for financial institutions.</p><p> <strong>  Deepening Customer Relationships with a 360 Degree View </strong></p><p> A single, 360-degree, tailored view of the customer is critical so that sales, service and marketing staff have contextually relevant information when they interact with clients to improve the customer experience. But financial institutions have struggled for years with combining information about products, usage patterns, customer service interactions, demographics, and relationships. As financial institutions invest in modern sales force automation and customer relationship management systems to achieve a holistic view of their clients, they need to solve the problem of combining data from traditional sources on-premises with new attitudinal and behavioral data derived from external sources such as social  <u>  <a href=\"http://mulesoft.com/integration-solutions/soa/digital-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   media  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Improving Data Driven Decision Making </strong></p><p> Analytics and business intelligence have always been critical in financial services. But those firms are now facing a flood of information arising from compliance initiatives, customer centric projects and non-traditional social media channels. In the era of &ldquo;big data, its not enough to create a massive data warehouse with every piece of information imaginable. The promise is in &ldquo;data driven decision making&rdquo;, defined as &ldquo;the practice of basing decision on the analysis of data rather than purely on intuition.&rdquo; In order for analytics projects to be successful, technology teams must break down organizational silos and standardize processes, tools and governance.</p><p> <strong>  To Learn More </strong></p><p> Download the whitepaper, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/soa/financial-services-data-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Unlocking Data to Transform Financial Services  </a>  &rdquo; </u> to learn more about how organizations can address these challenges and create competitive advantage by using integration to modernize existing systems.</p>",

Almost any decision is better than no decision at all.&rdquo; ~Brian Tracy</p><p> &ldquo;Be decisive. A wrong decision is generally less disastrous than indecision.&rdquo; ~Bernhard Langer</p><p> One of the ways that many of us cope with our insanely busy schedules is by putting off decisions. We&rsquo;ll gather everything that we need to make a decision then set all of that aside. When someone inquires about it we may say &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;, or in my case I use a slightly different term; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Do you remember your reaction when you were a child and received these responses from your parents? While in the business environment a &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always a &ldquo;no&rdquo; like it was with your parents, it&rsquo;s just about as annoying for team members.</p><p> Nobody ever won any awards or learned anything of value by saying &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;</p><p> I would encourage you to eliminate &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; and words/phrases like it from your vocabulary, and when you feel the urge to say them, force yourself to make the decision right then and there. A few things to consider:</p><p> <strong>  It doesn&rsquo;t usually take as long as you think </strong>  &ndash; Many times all of the information is there (including the person who put it together) and just needs some focus to come to a decision. Very often you&rsquo;ll find that the decision is obvious and can be made with only a few minutes review of the data and discussion with the people involved. This is especially true of any decision you might say &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; to.</p><p> <strong>  Increases organizational speed </strong>  &ndash; By setting an example of decisiveness and not wallowing in grey areas you will see your entire team move in that direction. This has a snowball effect on your organization and can lead to amazing results. Nowadays it is the fast organizations and people that stand out far more than others.</p><p> <strong>  Structure it in a way to learn and modify </strong>  &ndash; Startups do this all the time. Whether in formal &ldquo;A/B testing&rdquo; or through review of other forms of data (sales conversion, customer feedback, site traffic, etc.), they implement fast and change just as fast as they learn. In the fast paced industries they live in this is a basic of survival. In more mature industries this can still be enormously valuable as you get immediate feedback on what assumptions work and don&rsquo;t work. Whether it is new responsibilities for a team member, a change in policy, or simply a decision on whether to approve vacation time you can make a mistake and change it after the fact once you learn better.</p><p> <strong>  Frees up time </strong>  &ndash; What happens when you put off a decision? You just have to pick it back up again later and make it. By making the decision now you are almost always saving yourself time later. As you do this over and over again you&rsquo;ll see yourself gain more and more time.</p><p> Not all decisions can be made immediately and many should wait for all of the available data, but we often let the little to medium decisions wait for the same level of prep and analysis as the major (i.e. costly) decisions. In those cases the response you give to team members shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; it should be directed at what is missing for you to make the decision and coming up with a plan to fill the gap.</p><p> Make the decision and learn. Trying to learn from indecision and &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; is a useless endeavor.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by Bruce Milne | <a href=\"http://socialware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Socialware  </u> </a></p><p> &ldquo;Half of the time I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about&hellip;I&rsquo;m a foreigner in the world and I don&rsquo;t understand the language.&rdquo; &mdash; Jean Webster</p><p> That quote perfectly summarizes what I&rsquo;ve heard countless times at industry events and in one-to-one conversations with financial advisors when discussing the notion of using social media for business in financial services.</p><p> The rising influence and role of social media within the financial sector is plainly evident to anyone who has followed adoption trends since their tentative and skeptical beginnings to today, where we see major institutions announcing widespread social programs involving thousands of financial advisors.</p><p> It makes good sense. According to a 2013 study by Cogent Research, 34 percent of wealthy investors use social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter for personal finance decisions. Seven out of 10 said they have changed their relationship with an advisor or reallocated investments because of something they read on social media. About 36 percent of respondents said social media research prompted them to reach out to advisors.</p><p> <strong>  Different Views of Social Media among Advisors </strong></p><p> With social becoming the norm at many firms and more than 90 percent of financial professionals now stating they are actively participating on at least one social network, we&rsquo;re beginning to see an interesting bifurcation of social financial advisors. Disclaimer: these are generalizations, but I&rsquo;d argue empirical as well as anecdotal evidence suggests most advisors fall into one of these two camps.</p><p> The first group, which I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to calling &ldquo;Generation Connected,&rdquo; or Generation C for short, deserves credit for driving social adoption, both at an advisor level and at an institutional level. Perhaps the word &ldquo;generation&rdquo; is misleading though, because while of course many of these connected individuals are from a younger demographic that grew up with an &ldquo;always on&rdquo; mentality, we are seeing professionals of all ages fully embrace the idea of constant contact. They tend to share several attributes as it relates to social media usage:</p><li> Social is the preferred method of communicating online. That&rsquo;s not to suggest they don&rsquo;t also use email, instant messaging and other channels to communicate, but most view social&rsquo;s one-to-many model for publishing, narrowcasting and broadcasting updates as the most efficient and relevant ways to keep in touch with their personal and professional networks.</li><li> Social is like email; it is never truly &ldquo;off.&rdquo; These advisors tend to view social as a key part of their workflow, scheduling time to tweet/post/blog with specific intent to nurture leads, foster new relationships and meet clients where they are &mdash; which frequently means promoting and participating in conversations to get in front of prospects.</li><li> Social is where prospective clients are. Connected advisors wisely view social as a green field opportunity to educate and engage clients and prospects while differentiating themselves and their firms. Simply put, Generation C recognizes social media for what it is &mdash; an unprecedented opportunity to reach new customers and grow their business. <br/>  </li><p> The second group you could refer to as &ldquo;Digital Newcomers.&rdquo; Again, this isn&rsquo;t about age or generation as much as their digital inclination and their eagerness to dedicate a significant amount of time to learning new technologies or methods of communications. These are the people who still prefer to call instead of text. This group tends to think about social media through a different lens.</p><li> Social is just one form of communicating online. These advisors, many of whom have already built successful practices, view social media as another marketing channel and means to stay informed (actively or passively) about clients, prospects, other advisors or pertinent industry topics; however, they also are active and capable offline networkers and rely on a combination of methods to stay abreast of relevant news, events and industry developments.</li><li> Social is like TV; a little goes a long way. In my role at Socialware working with more than 100 financial institutions, perhaps the single most common concern I hear from the thousands of RIAs, wealth advisors and financial professionals we support is whether they can be effective on social without it become an all-consuming time investment. Our internal telemetry data further reinforces this balance with a significant portion of advisors logging into the platform 3-5 times per week for roughly 15 minutes. This time is typically used to monitor for relevant &ldquo;life events&rdquo; within their network that may offer an opportunity to connect with a contact, or to schedule content to post throughout the week.</li><li> Social is where existing clients are. Not surprisingly, Digital Newcomers are just as familiar with the social opportunity, but many are following their clients online. These individuals see the value in nurturing relationships through social media and are increasingly using social networking features to prospect and request introductions/referrals. <br/>  </li><p> I fully expect social media adoption to continue to grow exponentially within both groups, as more firms feel comfortable with existing regulations and the technologies that are now available to mitigate their compliance risks. For most firms, understanding how to effectively enable advisors from both groups is critically important so that each is able to participate in ways that feel comfortable and lead to tangible results.</p><p> Remember, there&rsquo;s no single right way to participate on social media, but not participating at all is a surefire way to miss out on the opportunity. You&rsquo;re guaranteed to miss 100 percent of the shots you don&rsquo;t take. The advisors who use social media aren&rsquo;t necessarily better at earning money for their clients, but they are much more likely to win new clients &ndash; quite possibly from the advisors who are absent from social media. </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Aaron Visse, CFA | <u>  Forward Investing </u></p><p> &ldquo;Do you think man will ever walk on the sun?&rdquo; This was the epic question posed to Buzz Aldrin by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen on the satirical program, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTKedyQQkZQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Da Ali G Show </a> .&rdquo; While we are pretty sure that mankind will never walk on the sun (no, not even in the winter when it&rsquo;s cold, per a follow-up question from Baron Cohen), we are seeing signs that solar power is rising (puns intended) and is in fact stepping on the toes of the traditional utility business model.</p><p> The increased adoption and continued evolution of solar technologies are very complicated topics that can quickly descend into lots of math and a plethora of arguments over various factors and assumptions. Since this is a blog post and not a white paper, the focus here will be high level and will concentrate on the facts that we can understand and measure today.</p><p> Solar is in its infancy as a power resource. Future projections about the timing of major technological breakthroughs and resulting adoption rates will vary widely among intelligent observers (and will likely prove spectacularly wrong in the fullness of time). Early projections about the personal computer or mobile telephone markets come to mind as reminders of how inaccurate even the experts can be in hindsight when opining about the efficacy of emerging technologies. With all that said, we do know several things today:</p><p> Solar is currently an incredibly small part of the U.S. energy mix&hellip; <br/> The chart below, based on U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, shows U.S. electricity generation by source in 2013. Coal represented 39% of energy generation, followed by natural gas at 28% and nuclear at 20%. Renewable generation, both hydroelectric and other, represented only 13% of total energy generation.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"870\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1_0.png\" width=\"1190\"/></p><p> As this chart shows, even within the renewable generation segment, solar is a mere pipsqueak. The vast majority of renewable energy is supplied by conventional hydroelectric at 51% and wind with 32%. Solar represented only 2% of the renewables segment, or just about 0.2% of total generation in 2013.</p><p> &hellip;But solar is the little acorn that could become the giant oak&hellip; <br/> The chart below shows the five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in U.S. electricity generation. It is notable for several reasons:</p><li> In the last five years, net power generation by all sources is actually negative (-0.3%), which represents a lack of demand growth in the U.S. since the 2008 global financial crisis.</li><li> Net generation from natural gas has grown modestly (+4.8%) in the presence of the U.S. shale revolution, while net generation from coal has declined by a similar amount (-4.4%).</li><li> Net generation from renewables has increased at a faster clip (+6.5%).</li><li> Despite the aforementioned decline in overall net generation, generation from wind increased at a very healthy clip (+24.8%).</li><p> But the most striking transformation is clearly taking place within the solar photovoltaic (PV) realm, which saw a CAGR of 155.8% over the same time period. There are many reasons for this increase such as government policy (subsidies), rising environmental awareness (which impacts government policy) and technological advancements, etc. While the merits of these factors (outside of the obvious gains in technology) can be debated, it is hard to argue that the addition in scale isn&rsquo;t a huge positive in terms of new investment for such a nascent technology.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2_1.png\" width=\"1190\"/></p><p> &hellip;Because two factors will continue to support this trend&hellip; <br/> Simply put, the price of conventional generation continues to rise, while the price of solar continues to fall. This is where things can get quite a bit more complicated, but we do know a few things today. It is well understood in a few markets like California and Hawaii, where the average price of electricity is relatively high in comparison to the national average and where solar resources are relatively abundant, that solar PV is competitive with retail electricity rates. Perhaps less well understood is that rising electricity prices in combination with falling component costs, lower financing costs and the availability of tax incentives has led to a number of U.S. states currently achieving &ldquo;grid parity,&rdquo; the critical point at which the cost of electricity generated by solar is equivalent to energy taken from the grid. Current projections, which have admittedly proven too optimistic in the past, are that the U.S. will achieve grid parity between 2014 and 2017.</p><p> The chart to the left below compares electricity price and demand going back to 2004. As the chart shows, even in the midst of relatively stagnant demand, the price of electricity manages to go up (as all of us with utility bills are painfully aware).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"542\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/3_0.png\" width=\"1190\"/></p><p> At the same time, the price of solar PV continues to decline. As the final chart next to it shows, from 1998 through 2013, price declines of installed solar have averaged approximately 6% to 8% per year, with a clear acceleration in that trend seen in recent years, according to data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p><p> &hellip;All of which could have meaningful implications for investors <br/> While but a minor speck on the electricity generation landscape today, solar has the potential to become a very disruptive technology for both the electric grid and the various utilities that operate it. In Part 2 of this post, we will discuss some of the challenges that solar faces to achieve greater scale, some of the threats it poses to the existing utility landscape, and companies and industries that are poised to benefit/suffer from such trends.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> No, I&rsquo;m not talking about how to wear your new winter scarf fifty different ways. In this case, I&rsquo;m referring to a document that can help you and your team (or your marketing agency) when it comes to creating communications to your clients and prospects.  For example, instead of having to pause each time to consider &lsquo;hmmm, should we underline or italicize our white paper titles?&rsquo; you could just consult your style guide.</p><p> Some corporations (and publications) have pretty exhaustive style guides, and for good reason&mdash;consistency is helpful for any reader. But you can start small.  In fact, a style guide is often a work-in-progress. These guides can be especially helpful in specific industries&mdash;financial services included&mdash;where there are industry terms, phrases or words that must be used in a specific way (or that will trigger the use of certain disclosures or formatting treatments).  You may even decide to incorporate a disclosure library into your guide.</p><p> Most companies will start with looking at the two main publishing style guides, <u>  <a href=\"http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Chicago Manual of Style  </a> </u> and the <u>  <a href=\"https://www.apstylebook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AP Style Book  </a> </u> , and then decide which one they&rsquo;ll side with as a preference. The other reference go-to when creating a style guide is Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary, 11th Edition.</p><p> Of course, now that so many communications are digital, you may want to think about how you represent your style online versus in print. For example, I&rsquo;ve worked with a financial services company that decided when it came to toll-free numbers, they&rsquo;d include the &ldquo;1-800-123-4567&rdquo; in print, and just &ldquo;800-123-4567&rdquo; online and in email.</p><p> You can really take your style guide in whatever direction you choose. For example, you may want to include how signatures are treated &ndash; again, both print and digital versions. Do you go with a less formal name in the signature block (e.g. Bob Smith), or something more formal (e.g. Robert G. Smith II)? Decide, and then have consistency going forward. In the long run, you&rsquo;ll save time (and money, if working with an agency for communications work) by having all of your style decisions made ahead of time. </p>",

Flaxington</p><p> When it comes to the selling process, most advisors focus on the process itself. How can you sell more effectively and to whom? One of the most basic components that is often overlooked is developing your story. Without a clear platform from which to launch your sales efforts, you and your team will likely struggle.</p><p> But what makes a good &ldquo;story&rdquo; or a good brand? How do you stand out when so many other advisors do similar things to your firm? Start the new year off by engaging in a branding exercise within your firm, and with your team. Work together to establish your story by doing the following:</p><li> List all of the things you believe are special or different about your team, your firm, and how you work with clients.</li><li> Once you have the list of those things you think are special or different, put your differ&shy;entiators to the &ldquo;so what?&rdquo; test. Next to what you&rsquo;ve written, ask &ldquo;so what?&rdquo; Why is this important or compelling for your audience?</li><li> Review your mission statement or firm values to find the words you use to talk about what&rsquo;s important to your practice. If you haven&rsquo;t written a mission statement or identified firm values, it&rsquo;s helpful to do that during a branding process.</li><li> Interview clients and Centers of Influence (COIs) to learn how they talk about what you do. Don&rsquo;t do a satisfaction survey; rather, interview them to hear the words they use to describe their experience of working with you. See your firm through their lens.</li><li> Review your competition to understand their themes and differentiators.</li><p> Once you have compiled all of the information, push your team to identify the three main points that are repeatable and most compelling. Find ways to validate those three differentia&shy;tors and create proof statements and stories to support them. Weave the points into all of your marketing communication efforts &ndash; be consistent with these points throughout all of your materials and sales process.</p><p> While you may believe the wealth manage&shy;ment and advisory services you offer are unique and special, the market may not feel the same. To be competitive, you must know your own services better than your competitors know theirs. You must be able to talk about what you do using language your market recognizes and that resonates with them. And you must be consistent and clear in your efforts.</p><p> Start this new year by solidifying your brand &ndash; get your team involved to create a compelling platform.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What You Need to Know </strong></p><p> The second most common compliance deficiency for RIA firms is omissions or inaccuracies in the firm&rsquo;s Form ADV. Some of these result from inconsistent upkeep of the ADV as the firm evolves. But in most cases we see, the deficiencies occur when firms use cookie cutter ADVs or borrow some/all of the content from another firm&rsquo;s ADV. <br/> <br/> On at least a yearly basis, RIAs are required to review and update their Form ADV so that it accurately describes the nature of their business to clients and prospects. (This occurs within 90 days of the firm&rsquo;s fiscal year end.)  <br/> <br/> Advisors are also expected to immediately update their Form ADV to reflect any material changes that occur throughout the year. These updates include, but are not limited to: </p><li> An accurate description of their fee structure</li><li> Full and accurate description of their business and services</li><li> Disclosure of any conflicts of interest or affiliations</li><li> Significant changes in their business (e.g. meaningful changes in AUM)</li><li> Changes in how clients may contact the firm (e.g. Address, Phone Number) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Why You Should Care </strong></p><p> While it may seem like a hassle to maintain an accurate Form ADV, these documents will not only make a difference from a regulator&rsquo;s perspective, but also from the point of view of clients and prospects. While not always apparent, your Form ADV creates an initial (sometimes lasting) impression on prospects, clients and competitors. Ensuring the accuracy of your Form ADV can lead to to more productive and efficient relationships by removing (or at least not creating) any potential ambiguity in the early stages of your relationships. <br/> <br/> It is not only important that the information contained in Form ADV is comprehensive and accurate, but you must also be able to evidence its timely delivery to all clients and prospects, keeping in mind that regulators must take a stance that if it&rsquo;s not documented, it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p> <strong>  Our Recommendations </strong></p><p> To ensure that your firm is keeping up with regulatory requirements and industry best practices in this area:</p><li> Avoid using a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach to creating your Form ADV so that you can be sure that it accurately reflects your firm&rsquo;s business practices, conflicts of interest, fee schedule, etc.</li><li> Update both Parts 1 and 2 of the Form ADV at least annually, keeping in mind that it must be updated more frequently if there have been material changes in your RIA.</li><li> Deliver Form ADV to clients in a timely fashion (within 120 days following your fiscal year end or upon any material update of the document).</li><li> Deliver Form ADV to all prospects prior to them signing your investment advisory agreement.</li><li> Maintain records of these distributions to ensure proper documentation for regulators.</li>",

But with all the talk about how important relationships are &ndash; why don&rsquo;t we spend more time focusing in this area?  The fact is that we often are just too busy trying to get through the work of the day. And, relationships are not what we DO in our businesses, right? Most firms are not in the &ldquo;relationship business,&rdquo; we are in the [INSERT your core offering] business.</p><p> Intuitively we know that relationships are important, but let&rsquo;s focus on the quantitative reality. When you look back on your previous sales, try affixing a reason that you acquired your best clients and your biggest sales. When you evaluate your business in this way, you may notice that the way others &ldquo;feel&rdquo; about you is critically important. They certainly would not go out of their way to do business with you or talk about you with others simply because of your product or service offering. There are likely many others who can do or provide the same core offerings.</p><p> Next, think about quantifying in dollars the value of the referrals, the word of mouth, and the repeat business you&rsquo;ve received &ndash; what would the number be? Combine this with the &ldquo;why did they choose me&rdquo; factor mentioned above and it becomes pretty compelling.</p><p> Almost always, there is a very direct correlation between the quality of your relationships with prospects and clients, and the rate of sales and growth in your business. But, are these facts important enough to you to make the change and raise the priority of being more proactive in your business relationships?</p><p> Consider making it your challenge. Reach out to one person each day above and beyond your regular day&rsquo;s interactions - a proactive contact with a client, prospect or a potential strategic alliance. Just one. You may find it can make a significant difference in both how you feel and even more importantly how others feel about you.</p>",

Let&rsquo;s let the data do the talking.</p><p> Twitter can be a magical place to share great information and connect with like-minded individuals. Sadly, however, this magic can also be attractive to spammers. And by spammers, I&rsquo;m referring to affiliate marketers, MLM&rsquo;s, and those who would simply prefer to hide behind technology rather than embrace it as a means to build meaningful relationships. These individuals either paid for their followers, joined a mass following website, or by other means artificially grew their social followers in order to intentionally deceive others into believing that they are a person of interest or genuine influence. This article is intended to help individuals make wiser decisions when deciding to connect with or do business with an individual on Twitter.</p><p> Disclaimer: Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, affiliate marketing is a staple for a large number of legitimate businesses. However, it is a fundamentally broken system that is plagued by mass marketers who blindly promote whatever they can in search engine optimized blog posts simply for the purpose of earning affiliate income.</p><p> With that being said, there are several ways you can identify if a user has a fake following on Twitter.</p><h3> <strong>  Open Networkers </strong></h3><p> While not always indicative of a spammer, a red flag should go up if the user has a 1:1 follow-to-follower ratio. If someone has 50,000 followers and follows 49,800 &ndash; 51,000 (or more) users, there is a strong chance that this person is using a &ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo; process to grow their audience. A &ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo; process works like this:</p><p> 1) Follow 1000 users using bulk follow tools <br/> 2) Wait 3 days <br/> 3) Unfollow the accounts that didn&rsquo;t follow back using bulk unfollow tools <br/> 4) Repeat the process every day religiously</p><p> There is an unspoken &ldquo;golden rule&rdquo; that between 10-14% of users, if carefully selected, will follow you back when followed first. That&rsquo;s not influence. That&rsquo;s math.</p><p> While the concept of following people in large amounts, and clearing out the non-followbacks seems like a spammy process, it&rsquo;s actually one that I recommend that companies implement &ndash; only with much stronger criteria and moderation on how it is executed. It can be a great way to put yourself or your brand on the social radar of your target audience. But we&rsquo;re not talking about brands, we&rsquo;re talking about influencers.</p><p> The reason I&rsquo;ve listed this as the #1 way to identify someone who is artificially representing themselves as an influencer is simple. First, if you&rsquo;re doing anything in &ldquo;bulk&rdquo;, you are unlikely to be engaging your new followers. And just because you got a new follower doesn&rsquo;t mean that that person is an advocate. So for many marketers out there using this process, one of the fundamental flaws of this technique is that there is very little time left to build any sort of meaningful relationship with new followers, and thereby convert them into loyal followers. This leads to a large audience that is almost entirely oblivious to your existence. Great job getting followers! Unfortunately, nobody cares that you exist. [insert cricket sounds]</p><p> Second, true influencers do not need to leverage these techniques to grow their audience. However, they typically have one common element that helps grow their followers on Twitter. This is typically due to the fact that they are on broadcast media, produce vlogs, are well known bloggers, create video reviews, and so on. Either that, or they come from publicly recognized seats of power and leadership, such a big-brand CEOs and other c-level officers. But for the common influencer, they typically have a wide variety of various multimedia channels and interactive content funneling back to their social media accounts.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re just getting started out, you may not have a presence on YouTube. You may not feel comfortable being on video. You may not be the best writer, and certainly don&rsquo;t feel like creating content. And to boot, you&rsquo;re camera shy and shun the idea of posting selfies. For this type of user, implementing a follow-back strategy as mentioned above can be a great way to create the foundation for becoming an influencer. However, to truly take ownership over that name, at some point you need to detach yourself from the follow-back process and embrace digital content as your champion. Then, pray like hell people take you seriously.</p><h3> <strong>  ReTweeters </strong></h3><p> The retweet can be a great way to build a relationship with a Twitter user by recognizing them for great content. It helps the user who gets retweeted to amplify the visibility of their content, and also serves as a testimonial to the audience of the person who did the retweeting. However, there are those who abuse the retweet and leverage them to create the illusion of influence.</p><p> Many of these users are easily identified by looking at their Twitter stream. Compared to legitimate influencers, spammers and casual Twitter enthusiasts will typically have a disproportionate amount of retweets when compared to true professionals who publish a healthy mix of engaging content.</p><h3> <strong>  Empire Avenue &amp; Tsu </strong></h3><p> Being a member of EA or Tsu doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re a spammer. I&rsquo;m a member on both (although I absolutely refuse to be active on Tsu,  <u>  here&rsquo;s why </u> ). However, both of these social &ldquo;networks&rdquo; are largely embraced by amateurs who seek to artificially establish themselves as experts over topics that they have very little background in. They also leverage a wide variety of questionable tactics that no legitimate company would ever consider using.</p><h3> <strong>  Empire Avenue </strong></h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://empireavenue.com/MichaelSim\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Empire Avenue  </a> </u>  considers itself a &ldquo;stock market for social media accounts&rdquo;. As a member, you become a stock that can be traded in the Empire Avenue stock market. You can also earn Empire Avenue&rsquo;s digital currency, &ldquo;Eaves&rdquo;, by earning dividends on other stocks that you invest in, or, by completing missions.</p><p> Missions are simple &ndash; you can dedicate a certain Eaves &ldquo;budget&rdquo; to incentivize other users to take a certain action on your content, such as &ldquo;visit a Tweet&rdquo;, &ldquo;visit a YouTube video&rdquo;, or &ldquo;visit a URL&rdquo;. Basically, you are paying people to view (and hopefully share) your content. The problem with this is that Empire Avenue has very few legitimate users, and is comprised largely of people who are either casual social media users or spam marketers. Any action taken on your content, such as a retweet, is typically broadcasted to a very detached and/or largely irrelevant audience that has very little interest in what you are trying to promote. Spammers will leverage Empire Avenue to artificially boost their retweets in order to convince others that they are influential.</p><p> To sum this up, be wary of anyone boldly sharing information that mentions Empire Avenue, claims to be an expert in the Empire Avenue community, or recommends Empire Avenue as a legitimate means to meet ANY sort of marketing goal. If they blog about Empire Avenue strategies, if they&rsquo;ve created a &ldquo;how to succeed on Empire Avenue&rdquo; YouTube video, or if they link to it in their updates &ndash; chances are that this professional is going to lead you in the wrong direction and expose your brand to a slew of unwanted users.</p><h3> <strong>  Empire Avenue Smoke &amp; Mirrors: </strong></h3><p> Some individuals have taken things to a far more deceptive level. Instead of simply using Empire Avenue to promote content for the company they work for (with the goal of getting website visitors), they&rsquo;ll use it to run retweet missions that promote a quoted retweet from a prospective customer&rsquo;s account (with the hope of gaining a new client). The sales prospect feels honored by the fauxlebrity treatment (an influx of meaningless retweets), and the spammer gets a new client. This is not a victimless crime, mind you, as these marketers typically have very little agency-level experience and lack the proper mindset to properly manage a brand in the social space. This results in very little a/b testing, neglects the development of a proper content strategy, and typically leads to the use of additional black-hat promotion techniques.</p><h3> <strong>  Empire Avenue Klout Gaming </strong></h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://klout.com/#/chicagodesign\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Klout  </a> </u>  currently holds the title as the social media standard for influence. And while Klout is a strong indicator of a user&rsquo;s influence, it is very easily gamed. Just as I mentioned the way content and social media posts can be promoted in Empire Avenue, so can &ldquo;+K missions&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m proud to say that I fluctuate between a 65 and 71 based on my general activity without having to play the system. Great content, conversation, thought sharing, relationship building; these are what social media is all about. Beware of the people in the 90&prime;s. If you haven&rsquo;t heard of them, and they aren&rsquo;t backed by a major brand, congratulations; you&rsquo;ve got yourself a case of the spam.</p><h3> <strong>  Tsu </strong></h3><p> <u>  Tsu </u>  recently hit the market with an interesting proposition. They pay out 90% of their ad revenue proportionately to those who create and share the content on which those ads are displayed. Simply put, if I create an update that receives 1,000,000 views, I will personally receive 90% of the ad revenue that it generates. If someone shared that update, they are partially responsible for creating an ad impression, and they too will receive a cut.</p><p> Needless to say that the sheer amount of spammers who have flocked to this site made it feel like the scene in Braveheart where Mel Gibson throws the sword &ndash; a stampede of sweaty Scottsmen hellbent on freedom. In this case the Scottsmen are spammers hellbent on making money. To sum this up nicely, you do not want to associate your brand with sweaty freedom-seeking Scottsmen or spammers, unless you own a kilt company.</p><p> <u>  Read more </u>  on my assessment of Tsu, and how I believe it is a bad move for companies to implement into their social strategy.</p><h3> <strong>  The Apps Shall Set You Free </strong></h3><p> If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re probably looking for a quick fix to tell if someone is misrepresenting their online influence. These three tools do a great job at analyzing and providing a very basic report on the legitimacy of a user&rsquo;s followers.</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://fakers.statuspeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   StatusPeople.com&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fakers&rdquo;  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialbakers.com/twitter/fakefollowercheck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SocialBakers.com&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fake Followers&rdquo;  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://twitteraudit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TwitterAudit.com  </a> </u></li><h3> Other Spam Identifiers</h3><p> Other than the methods listed above, there are a wide variety of ways to identify a spammer.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.&rdquo;  </strong> ― Albert Einstein</p><p> Mistakes are a blessing, and fortunately we all make them.</p><p> Fortunately?</p><p> Yes! The human experience is meant to have both highs and the lows in life, and in every failure, within every low point, is the gift of knowledge, and the power to try again.</p><p> I do not mean to downplay the consequences, challenges and emotional toil that mistakes make on our lives. But whether it&rsquo;s a bad investment, a poor career decision, or a relationship gone sour, we all must realize, accept and declare that we are stronger than we think we are, and can handle the current situation, and any other problems that arise along the way.  We must choose to carry on fearlessly and triumphantly.</p><p> The real issue with making mistakes is when they become an obsession with perfection, which serves only to hold us back in life. Mistakes are essential lessons that help us get where we want to go.  They help us move forward to our full potential. We fail our way to success by learning what we don&rsquo;t want; this is why mistakes are a blessing.</p><p> I understand it&rsquo;s not easy to think of mistakes as blessing, and to get past the fear of making them. Here are few suggestions to help you embrace your mistakes, learn from them, and become empowered by them:</p><p> Live  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi\" target=\"_blank\">   Wabi Sabi  </a> </u> . The Japanese have a name for the art of imperfections: It&rsquo;s called the Wabi-Sabi. It is said to discover Wabi-Sabi is to see the singular beauty in something that may at first look decrepit and ugly. Wabi-Sabi reminds us that we are all transient beings on the planet &ndash; our bodies, as well as the material world around us, are in the process of returning to dust.  It is the impermanence of life and the courageous embracement of its frailty.  And making mistakes is part of that frailty.</p><p> <strong>  Get perspective on your mistakes. </strong> Is it really as bad as you think? Probably not. Can you take the experience and turn it into something else? Change direction; make another decision; be willing to admit you made a mistake and ask for help.</p><p> <strong>  Forgive yourself. </strong> If the mistake turned your life upside down, think about the steps you can take to recover from it, and look for opportunities to fine tune the areas in your life that are most important to you. Was it embarrassing and nothing more? Move on!  For the most part, mistakes are not life threatening, only life limiting if you choose to let them hold you back from saying the one word that will bring about a change in direction&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Say NEXT to your mistakes </strong>  and leave the door wide open to experiment. When we say &ldquo;next&rdquo; to events or circumstances that are less than ideal, we give ourselves the opportunity to move forward, expand and learn something new.  Thomas Edison didn&rsquo;t just invent the light bulb.  He tried thousands of things before he finally hit on the right combination. Imagine if Mr. Edison had been too afraid to fail?  Lights out!</p><p> <strong>  There is true power in failure. </strong> When we understand the principle that failures are regularly caused by not having enough information, we can begin to move forward in a new direction. If you are missing parts of the &ldquo;story&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t possibly make the right decision, the right choice, or take the right direction.  And there is always more we can learn. Failure is never the end of the story, unless you choose that position. The power inherit in failure is the lesson, the knowledge we gain from failing to make ourselves stronger, more experienced, and more alive.</p><p> This is how we fail forward toward success.</p><p> <strong>  What does failing your way forward to success me to you? </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/home/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sharon Pivirotto  </u> </a> The saying, &ldquo;If you build it, they will come,&rdquo; may sound like a great plan for starting and growing your firm, but building the foundation alone will not get you clients.And if you already have a few clients and focus all of your energy and attention on outstanding customer service, you&rsquo;ll have an award-winning client retention rate, but this still does not equate to new client growth.If you want to grow your business and increase the number of clients you serve, you should start with the following four steps: <strong>  1. Define &amp; articulate your unique value proposition. </strong> While this may sound obvious, defining your target market, defining your competitive advantage, and ensuring it is consistently told in all of your marketing material takes purposeful planning.You need to start with identifying specifically who you serve.  For people to see you as a clear choice, you must represent a clear solution for a specific type of problem or specific type of client.  This is not possible if your defined client is &ldquo;companies that offer 401k plans&rdquo;.Think about it, specialists make more than generalists and get more referrals &ndash; but it&rsquo;s a difficult concept for advisors to embrace because no one wants to leave money on the table by casting a narrow net &ndash; so we become just like everyone else, in hopes to attract everyone else, and then we must compete with everyone else.  When you appeal to everyone &ndash; you appeal to no one.  Niches equal riches.  Define your segment or target that addresses some characteristic or challenge that a small portion of the population can relate to.Next in identifying your unique value is to define your competitive advantage. In the book &ldquo;How to Get Your Competition Fired&rdquo; by Randy Schwantz, he describes the three ways you can have a competitive advantage.</p><li> First, you can provide a service that is unique, that no one else provides.</li><li> Second, you can provide a service that others provide, but you have a better process for it that gets better results.</li><li> Or third, you can describe the service you offer in such a clear and compelling way that prospects are motivated to buy from you rather than from your competition.</li>You need to be able to clearly articulate your competitive advantage, and ensure this message is consistently told throughout all of your marketing, website, social media and public-facing material.There&rsquo;s a great worksheet for developing your unique value proposition in the special report titled<a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/free-resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo; <u>  3 Steps to Developing a Marketing Strategy That Doesn&rsquo;t Suck&rdquo; found here </u> .</a><strong> 2. Focus on one marketing strategy.</strong>One of the biggest challenges we all struggle with is time.  If you&rsquo;re going to create and implement a strategy for growth, you must be selective in your strategies and deliberate in how you implement them so you don&rsquo;t waste valuable time trying and testing tactics that may not be suited for you and your business.Start by select a marketing strategy that you find effective, enjoyable and easy.  So many of us find something that works, then we stop doing it to try something that we think or hope might work better.  If you&rsquo;ve been successful in the past with specific marketing methods &ndash; do more of that! Don&rsquo;t get sidetracked with the latest and greatest method you just read about that may or may not work for your practice.  No need to throw spaghetti at the wall.If you&rsquo;re not sure where to start because you&rsquo;re new to the business or have been in &ldquo;service&rdquo; mode for too long, then consider one of these three methods that were cited in the FSS Marketing Effectiveness Survey* as being the most successful:<li> Referral Marketing (center of influence relationships)</li><li> Educational Seminars (speaking and educating)</li><li> Social Meetings / Luncheons (good old fashioned networking and one-on-one relationship building)</li>Whatever method you choose, be dedicated, focused and strategic with how you schedule and implement your activity.(*An executive summary of the FSS Marketing Effectiveness Survey is found in the free report titled <a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/free-resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo; <u>  3 Steps to Developing a Marketing Strategy That Doesn&rsquo;t Suck </u> &rdquo;.</a>)<strong> 3. Develop a pipeline process &amp; prospect experience.</strong>Once you get a lead into your system, the quickest way to waste a quality lead is to not have a prospect and pipeline management process. How you interact with a prospect, what you deliver ahead of your meeting, present at your meeting, and follow-up with should all be part of a well-orchestrated and consistent process.And since 90% of the prospects you meet with will NOT make an immediate decision or have an immediate need, you need an ongoing communication program in place to continue to engage, keep in front of, provide ongoing value, pre-sell your expertise, and keep your hot prospect from turning back into a cold lead.FSS, a division of fi360, Inc. offers a sample prospect process and complete drip program (with documents for sending to clients) as part of their Credibility Building Kit found at <u> www.401kservicesolution.com</u>.<strong> 4. Apply these 5 qualities of excellence.</strong>They say customer service is dead, and based on the number of emails in my &ldquo;awaiting a response&rdquo; folder in Outlook, I regretfully must agree.One of the easiest ways to increase your opportunity of closing more business is to make service excellence a priority.  Here are five qualities that when adopted, can create an advantage over your competition.<li> Be prepared &ndash; research and gather data on our prospect before you meet with them, control the process (have a process!), and always use an agenda.</li><li> Be different &ndash; don&rsquo;t lead with the 3F conversation (fiduciary, funds, and fees), seek to understand what problems they have or need solved, and for goodness sake &ndash; pitch YOURSELF and the value you bring as the solution, not specific providers.</li><li> Be valuable &ndash; make sure you&rsquo;ve identified what it is your clients value the most, measure and monitor the value of your service offering, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to tweak your service model or make adjustments as needed.</li><li> Be persistent &ndash; be prompt, responsive, polite and pleasantly persistent.</li><li> Be proactive &ndash; engage &amp; educate prospects and clients, and report annually on your services, activity, and results.</li>By following these four steps, you&rsquo;ll be better positioned to attract, nurture and convert 401k prospects into clients.

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmoconnell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Paul O'Connell  </a> </u>  | Nephronim</p><p> Skype and coffee are my two basic tools when I&rsquo;m on the job of talking to startups who ask me to look over their product or site and give a practical honest critique of it. I&rsquo;m a startup guy and I love helping out as much as possible so handing out tid-bits of advice on direction or usability can be alot of fun. After doing quite a few of these I realise that many of the startups don&rsquo;t have designers and are winging it themselves. This in mind I thought that I would volunteer some &lsquo;cliff notes&rsquo; of design advice when putting together the identity and structuring your website or even app.</p><p> To this end here are 8 things to avoid when starting down the road of putting the website together or starting into the iterative process of your MVP. Obviously this is all dependant on your product but there are some universal design constants more startups can aim to avoid. On average a startup team constitution is made up of the lead developer and the Marketing/business guy. I will assume for the purposes of this article that either two will have some understanding of Photoshop / Illustrator / Fireworks or another design program they feel comfortable with.</p><p> <strong>  1/ Design isn&rsquo;t what you might think it is: </strong></p><p> Design is communication. The interaction, behaviours, flows even down to the copy that you talk to your users with, all of this is designed communication and process. But most importantly design is problem solving through process and ingenuity. This is me setting out broad context.</p><p> <strong>  2/ A fixed identity at the beginning is crazy: </strong></p><p> In my opinion like the motivations of every user the product should begin with itself and move outward. If you are young and still in the discovery stage there will be alot of questions still in the air. Who the company is, what problem you are actually solving and how you will go about it. A logo, Identity and the guidelines that a brand needs are fed by the direction and vision that a company has established. In a few months time you could be pivoting into a completely different area so the visual identity you need has to be as fluid as you are right now. Logo&rsquo;s are the heart and soul of companies so wait until you have finished the discovery phase to begin putting the full identity together. Setting out a simple colour palette and some rules to what those colours are and how they should be deployed can be a great time saving measure. When deciding on colours understand that every colour has a meaning and have their complimentary and contrasting partner. Have a look at this article on the Huffington Post on The Psychology of Color in Logo Design (INFOGRAPHIC) . This will start down the path of defining your look and feel: instruments of how you talk to the user/customer.</p><p> Decide on a font. Whether that be Googlefonts/Typekit integration or just the basic web-safe font choices it doesn&rsquo;t really matter just pick one and stick to it. I have seen alot of startup websites where pages have different sized fonts on multiple pages. This breaks the rhythm that you build from page to page. Make it large enough to comfortably read with a good line-height so paragraphs of content don&rsquo;t look cluttered and give it space to breath. You will hear designers mention the fact that most images and content aren&rsquo;t left to breath in layouts and this is very true. Simply giving elements enough space to communicate and not overwhelm the user can make the experience for the user more comfortable. I read a good article entitled &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let your startup make these design mistakes&rsquo; by Matias Corea on the TNW blog and it addresses column size and basic typographic rules for layout in detail.</p><p> <strong>  3/ Don&rsquo;t launch into it and hope it all comes together: </strong></p><p> When starting the site design process ask yourself &ldquo;What do you want the user to learn or achieve?&rdquo;. With this in mind structure your sequence of pages to accomplish that goal. My philosophy has always been &lsquo;One page one focus&rsquo;. When planning out your website pages and wireframing what elements really need to go into them?. Set the mantra for each page, whether this be an about page or a set of intake screens to ingratiate users into the process of website. It&rsquo;s very easy to get lost in the complication of trying to explain something clearly and quickly.</p><p> I am a big believer in mapping out every page of your site or app. I have worked with many startups who added pages as needed and then have to come back at a later stage and try and rework the tangled mess of pages that it has become. In building terms this becomes akin to adding an extension to an extension of a new house. It becomes a costly measure and can be easily avoided with a little planning at the early stages.</p><p> What I do at the start is add all the elements I think should be on each page. Then I slowly reduce it back to where clarity in communication is achieved using the simplest mixture of elements possible . Try and aim for simplicity at all times. This is the first point where user feedback can help you refine the features and options that users actually interact with and takes the guessing game out of the equation.</p><p> <strong>  4/ You are not the target audience: </strong></p><p> Gathering feedback during any part of the design phase is absolutely essential. This can be done during the simple identity phase or when you get the bones of your designed MVP together. You are not the target audience and thinking that the shade of purple you like is what all your audience will adore will ultimately prove not to be as insightful as actually talking to your actual users and audience. Just remember to gather as much information and data as possible and set upon the task of deciding what data is useful and what isn&rsquo;t. Not all feedback is good or relevant feedback but gathering it all together will help you make informed decisions now and in the future.</p><p> Any UX designer will tell you the power of user scenarios. This is simply defining the story of your user so you can refine tactics to fully engage with them in a more directed manner. Alot of User eXperience revolves around defining context and mapping out the needs of the user. Then you move to meeting these needs. Being user centric should be your core rationale behind near all design decisions taken as it only serves to build a strong more connective experience for the individual user. Here is a well laid out guide to user scenarios.</p><p> <strong>  5/ Designing with a kitchen sink mentality: </strong></p><p> How your present content is incredibly important. Creating an effective homepage can be a huge task, balancing the content, visuals and an explanatory process. Understand density of content and the different levels of understanding that you might cater to. Here you can take the idea of &lsquo;Cater and layer&lsquo;. I worked with a not for profit multi-national company and they possessed thousands of pages of content that needed to opened out for users that were very familiar with the organisations goals and also to visitors that happened upon the website for the first time. Make access points from the homepage to different densities of information. We did this using hubs for the content so you can get an overview of the section and lay it out to be explored.</p><p> Use a grid system. Whether that be the Golden Ratio or a proportional responsive grid system, use one of the many permutations out there. It unifies all the elements of the page that you rationalised should be there. The grid offers some solid structure so you can align features/headers/navigation systems from one page to another so the user doesn&rsquo;t have to notice small errors in placement of buttons or texts.</p><p> \"A design should have some tension and some expression in itself. I like to compare it with the lines on a football field. It is a strict grid.In this grid you play a game and these can be nice games or very boring games.\"  &mdash; Wim Crouwel <br/> <br/> <strong>  6/ The website should be the same as the mobile experience: </strong></p><p> No. Design for context. Different situations demand different actions and functionalities from the UI. Mobile and responsive setups only help refine the focus of the features but the whole feature set doesn&rsquo;t need to be available when you are mobile. I have made this mistake on some projects directly translating feature sets without thinking about whether they will be used. I personally believe that the mobile experience is not where users will input alot of data or go beyond a few clicks to achieve their goal, it&rsquo;s a browse and consume content while being mobile. The pay-off needs to be very clear to even get the user to input text on an iPhone for example so keep reassuring proposition and pay-off without over-playing your hand.</p><p> <strong>  7/ Don&rsquo;t talk at your users: </strong></p><p> It seems like common sense but know who you&rsquo;re talking to. When putting the copy together for the pages decide the tone of voice early on and how you want to talk to users. This flows not only to the copy for the web pages but also for automatic mailings you set up and even to 2 pagers for gaining investment interest at the beginning. Keep language simple and accessible. Test out the copy on as many people as you can for grammar/spelling but also that the text makes sense while making sure you don&rsquo;t talk at them with jargon and buzzwords. You are the authority on your product and you want to introduce it to the uninitiated.</p><p> <strong>  8/ Rounded corners and textured backgrounds are not the key: </strong></p><p> Reading up on current trends, whether your visuals should be flat or skeuomorphic, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up on the wave of what feels popular. Even looking around on having the style web2.0 or 3.0 for that matter it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Whatever style allows you to keep changing, testing and iterating will be fine to prove your product. As along as the experience feels well put together and thought out then even small design errors will be forgiven until you fully stand on your own two feet and are more suited to better address them. Your users want to help and support even in the early days. We all love the underdog! Remember to shorten the path for yourself by creating good ground work now (and record it) this will help you further down the line.</p><p> There are many useful tools and plugins to help bridge the transition from design to implementation but I like to use UberLayer which is an app that allows you to position a translucent image of the design over the actual in browser output of the code. Very helpful for positioning and getting everything aligned.</p><p> Bringing everything together in a nice bow-tie, I would say that the keys to tackling the mountain of doing design without the a dedicated designer is keep it simple for yourself and for implementation. Know who you are talking to and design for them. As much as possible be inclusionary and test assumptions whether that be the main concept to the feature set, the user is part of the design team. Plan and set out your decisions well from colour choices to things you definitely don&rsquo;t want but record them and put them on the wall so they aren&rsquo;t forgotten. If you can achieve just a few of these goals this will help you make the first-steps to a comfortable personal experience for your users and maybe begin the journey as a design culture startup. The next stage will be to find and bring a designer in to pull all the ground work you started together. Good luck with it.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.heinzmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Matt Heinz  </u> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s a lost art, but can quickly become your secret weapon.  Few people take the time to send hand-written notes anymore, but they can have amazing power.  Perhaps more than ever before, they stand out and make you look really good.  And if used effectively &ndash; in the right contexts and timed well &ndash; they can help you win and influence more business as well.</p><p> Here are a few examples to get you started.  Why not use the last few weeks of the year to start a new habit?</p><p> By the way, if you don&rsquo;t feel like you have time to write them yourself, try  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2014/10/matts-app-week-maillift/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MailLift  </a> </u> .  It works brilliantly.</p><li> Executive thank you notes:  Encourage your management team to write quick, hand-written notes to customers and top prospects.  It can be a simple &ldquo;thank you for your business&rdquo; or &ldquo;thanks for attending our event.&rdquo;  Just a couple lines, a couple times a week, can go a long way.</li><li> Gift promo codes:  Thank loyal customers with a surprise coupon and a hand-written coupon code.  I&rsquo;ve actually tested coupon codes delivered via a machine-printed letter and a hand-written letter.  The huge increase in conversion rate made taking the time to write notes worth it (especially if you outsource that effort to an intern or admin or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2014/10/matts-app-week-maillift/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MailLift  </a> </u> ).</li><li> Customer service follow ups:   Put a stack of note cards and envelopes next to the desk of your high-touch customer service reps.  Encourage them to write a short thank you note to customers after a good call, including their business card or a branded sticker or something fun.</li><li> Event attendee follow ups:  Divvy up the cards between those who attended the show or staffed the book, and have people knock them out on the flight home.  Have an admin or intern coordinate getting them stamped and mailed.</li><li> Job candidates:  It&rsquo;s a good practice for candidates to send thank you notes to prospective employers.  But what about sending a thank you note to candidates you&rsquo;re wooing and recruiting?  It says something about the culture you have, and just might help sway your preferred candidates to come on board. <br/>  </li><p> Of course, sending a hand-written note is more time consuming than firing off an email or social media message.  How do you lower that barrier and increase your likelihood of making it a regular habit?</p><li> Have note cards and envelopes ready and nearby: If it&rsquo;s as easy are reaching into a drawer, you&rsquo;re far more likely to write something than digging through a closet or wondering what you should wrote on.  Simple cards with your logo in a corner should suffice, but even generic non-branded cards are fine.</li><li> Have postage:  Stick a pack of forever stamps next to those note cards.</li><li> Create a daily reminder: I use my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2011/11/use-a-daily-do-list-to-remember-execute-the-little-things/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   daily do list  </a> </u> , but you can use whatever system keeps you organized (calendars, task lists, etc.).</li><p> Tip of the iceberg, these ideas are.  What else can you think of? How could you start leveraging hand-written notes to drive your business objectives?</p>",

    "title": "Four Marketing Strategies for the New Year",
    "link": "four-marketing-strategies-for-the-new-year",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wealthmanagementmarketing.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mandy Fisher  </a> </u>  | Wealth Management Marketing, Inc.</p><p> Can you believe that 2015 is just around the corner? The  <u>  holiday season </u>  is a busy time of year, but it is also the time to start thinking about next year&rsquo;s marketing efforts. In one of my  <u>  previous blog posts </u> , I encouraged you to put together a 2015 marketing plan so that you can hit the ground running in January. I now want to share four strategies that you may want to incorporate into your marketing plan for 2015.</p><p> <strong>  1. Host Small Group Events </strong></p><p> My first suggestion is that you host small group events throughout the year. The event could be educational, such as a presentation on retirement tips, or it could be more social, such as a cooking class at a restaurant. Small events for 10 to 20 people allow for more intimate conversation so you can really get to know the needs of your current and potential clients. You should host the events on a consistent basis, such as monthly or quarterly. Consistency allows for everyone you want to reach to attend at least one event. Then, those who really enjoy the event can come back another time and bring their friends.</p><p> &ldquo;One of the best ways to provide quality client service is by putting together a client touch-point calendar.&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/TG95h\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tweet this  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  2. Encourage Client Referrals </strong></p><p> The second strategy you should consider making part of your 2015 marketing efforts is encouraging client referrals. There are differing theories about whether you should outright ask a client for a referral. My opinion is that your clients should be your biggest cheerleaders and this will happen only when they feel you are taking care of them. If they feel welcomed and supported, then they will want to tell others about you. When I have a positive experience with a service provider, I constantly am telling my friends about it. I want them to share the positive experience with me.</p><p> One of the best ways to provide quality client service is by putting together a client touch-point calendar. This will ensure that you are connecting with your clients on a continual basis. Another easy way to connect with your clients is to host an annual client appreciation event. This is a bonus for them and you. It does not have to be a huge event. It should just be relatable to your clients.</p><p> <strong>  3. Build Center-of-Influence Relationships </strong></p><p> Centers of influences (COIs) for financial advisors are attorneys, accountants and anyone else who would have an influence on your potential new clients. You should first identify which COIs you want to target and then find ways to connect with them and remind them of your services. One way you could do this is to keep a list of other professionals your clients work with. Then reach out to those individuals and explain that you would like to talk about how you can work together to provide the best service for your mutual client. You could then send a monthly email to your list of COIs reminding them of who you are and giving facts that they would find useful. The goal is to meet one of their needs so that they will be more willing to refer clients to you.</p><p> <strong>  4. Embrace Digital Marketing </strong></p><p> In this day and age, everything is going digital. In fact, I am writing this blog post on Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day. Digital marketing is huge for the holidays, as companies try to reach shoppers and encourage them to come in and buy. Digital marketing for financial advisors should be about reaching their potential clients wherever they are. Would they go online and search sites such as NAPFA or FPA to find a financial advisor near them? If so, then you should consider completing an online profile with these organizations and being as active as possible on these sites. Is social media a place where your potential clients go often? Then choose a medium such as Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook, build your profile and engage with people as much as possible. There is also Google Ads, which can drive people to your website.</p><p> Whether you choose to embrace these or other digital marketing strategies, be sure you are not doing it just because it is popular and new, but because it will resonate with your clients and potential clients. Otherwise, your digital marketing efforts will fail and you will end up frustrated.</p><p> <strong>  Choose Marketing Tactics That Work for Your Business </strong></p><p> These are just four marketing strategies that you should consider using in the new year. By no means do you have to use any of them. They are just suggestions. The best and worst thing about marketing is that there is a plethora of tactics out there. Having so many options is great, but it can also be debilitating as you do not know which combination is best. Keep in mind that you just have to find what works best for you and will help you reach your clients and potential new clients. While you enjoy the holidays with friends and family, do not forget to take the time to think about your marketing for next year so that you can be ahead of the game.</p>",

    "link": "the-fiduciary-liability-of-the-imprudent-fiduciary",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Many fiduciaries think more like a participant than one concerned with managing the fiduciary liability of their plan. I once talked to a plan fiduciary and found that they had money in two previous 401(k) plans. I was puzzled as to why that was the case. It came up in a conversation where they were discussing the fact that they were now divorced and had not change their beneficiary designation on one of those previous accounts.</p><p> <strong>  Fiduciary as participant </strong></p><p> You might think that a fiduciary would first look out for their own interest, especially when they were a participant in a plan. A fiduciary should actually know more than the typical participant regarding investments and the rules that govern 401(k) plans. The fiduciary role comes with the potential for personal financial loss. Why would this fiduciary simplify their life and roll their previous 401(k)&rsquo;s into their current plan? This would allow them to avoid the problem when beneficiary designations don&rsquo;t match your current situation. Moreover, they have the ability to affect the plan menu and make sure that the fees debited from their account are fair and reasonable.</p><p> <strong>  Fiduciary liability as investment fiduciary </strong></p><p> A responsible plan fiduciary has access to more information about their plan than the typical participant.  If you&rsquo;re working with a retirement consultant that is an investment fiduciary, that person should be providing you with reports such as this. Based on this knowledge the aforementioned fiduciary could compare results to their other 401(k) plans. (This free look works for IRAs too). Why wouldn&rsquo;t a fiduciary make their existing plan the best choice, aided with this outside information?</p><p> I have a few clients that work for companies with tens of million dollar 401(k)/ERISA 403(B) plans. I tell them that if they held the same investment in their plan that is currently held in their IRA, they would get better investment results because of lower fees. That is the power of fees and working with an investment advisor representative that is bound to keep their client&rsquo;s interests first. That does assume that their plan is leveraging their bulk purchasing power to qualify for the lowest fee available. As a fiduciary you should understand that all things being equal, lowering fees may help drive investment performance. </p><p> <strong>  Discerning fiduciary liability </strong></p><p> In conversations with many fiduciaries I have discovered that many simply go along with the existing 401(k) program. Sometimes that program knowingly or accidentally has self-dealing, a fiduciary liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Self-dealing occurs when someone at the firm is getting special treatment or some client billing in exchange for being the broker on the 401(k) plan. &ldquo;Bill or Jane has done well by me or the partners so I&rsquo;m sure that we are in good hands&rdquo; has become the chant of some investment committees. Some fiduciaries feel that working with deep pocketed firms as either their record keeper or broker that they are in a &ldquo;safe position.&rdquo; Many investors felt that with Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch before the Great Recession hit. Bernie Madoff was once highly regarded and managed assets for the New York Mets and Steven Spielberg.</p><p> With this kind of backdrop some fiduciaries have just not developed a discerning eye or take the time to read the Department of Labor&rsquo;s publication &ldquo;Meeting Your Fiduciary Responsibilities&rdquo;. It gives a cursory review of the responsibilities and fiduciary liability an ERISA plan fiduciary such as a 401k or ERISA 403(b).</p><p> Are you one of the many time crunched fiduciaries struggling to bridge the gap between their short-term career and long term retirement interests? Do you need a personal retirement risk review and a plan risk review? If you are part of an investment committee you owe it to yourself to understand your individual risk exposure. In addition to education, you may want liability insurance. While you may not want to rock the boat, if there is a Department of Labor audit emergency you will have a personal risk control plan.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Of course it&rsquo;s all about the clients. That&rsquo;s why you have your own advisory firm &ndash; to better serve your clients. Now imagine a couple of scenarios that have happened or could happen to you.</p><li> At a meeting, the client notices a mistake. The report displays shares of a security that you were asked to sell. Everyone makes mistakes and your client might not think anything of it &ndash; until the client notices another mistake.</li><li> When clients call with questions, you and your staff repeatedly answer with &ldquo;let me look into it and get back to you&rdquo;, and then scramble to find the answer.</li><li> You realize that only a small percentage of your clients are using the portal.</li><p> Your business processes can either lead to or prevent issues such as the above. Many areas of the decision-making process begin with &ldquo;what&rsquo;s best for my clients&rdquo; but then takes a sharp left. Reasons include cost, hasty decision making, and not knowing your clients well enough.</p><p> The following are several business considerations that directly affect your clients. Do any of these situations apply to your firm?</p><p> <strong>  Clients will notice if you don&rsquo;t spend enough on your infrastructure </strong></p><p> I have seen advisors that want a professional to wear many hats &ndash; operations, technology, compliance, client services, and financial analyst &ndash; but with a budget only for an administrative assistant. They forego the experienced professional for an inexperienced assistant.</p><p> When budgeting for the firm&rsquo;s infrastructure, I find there are two types of advisors; those that don&rsquo;t want to spend a dime more than necessary and those that don&rsquo;t want to spend a dime. While you don&rsquo;t need an expensive budget, your goal shouldn&rsquo;t be as close to zero as possible.</p><p> <strong>  The latest technology you are using is only as good as what your client understands </strong></p><p> I saw statistics regarding client portal usage as low as 30%. Could clients lack of understanding of the data, or information, be one reason for the poor adoption rate?</p><p> I have seen many instances where the reports look great &ndash; the colors in the pie chart are beautiful, lines in the graph go straight up, and a lot of numbers are on the page. The problem is no message, or story, exists behind the data. How are clients supposed to understand what they mean? Prior to delivering reports, imagine your client staring at the chart, tables, and numbers. Is the message clear or is the client expected to translate the data? Might your client incorrectly interpret the data?</p><p> <strong>  If outsourcing, remember that clients will be looking to you for answers, not your outsourcing services </strong></p><p> I am all for outsourcing. There are areas of your business that require outside expertise and can best be met by outsourcing such as compliance and IT infrastructure. However, the idea of outsourcing &ldquo;everything you don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; is questionable. The decision to outsource shouldn&rsquo;t only be based on what&rsquo;s easiest for you.</p><p> You still need an understanding of the outsourced process and manage the services and staff as if the services were in-house. Service providers should not know more about your clients than you do.</p><p> <strong>  Time spent on client reviews will determine how successful your client meetings are </strong></p><p> The last thing you want clients to see are your mistakes. Even minor errors can irritate a client such as recently provided client information not updated in the system, or a report heading that identifies a divorced client as &ldquo;Mrs&rdquo;. The rush to get the reports out allowed the errors to be overlooked.</p><p> Set aside enough time to perform internal reviews, testing and reconciliation tasks. Ensure that the data and story are accurate and makes sense. The client review process should not solely be left to your technology or outsourcing services.</p><p> <strong>  As you reflect on your decisions, have you really been thinking about your clients? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Denis Storey </u></p><p> Everyone&rsquo;s either looking back or looking ahead this time of year.</p><p> Especially those of us in the media who are as eager to trumpet our past success stories as we are to show you how wise we are when we tell you what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p><p> (Don&rsquo;t worry; our own version of this will be appearing soon.)</p><p> Forbes jumped on the bandwagon early this year with its &ldquo;Top Ten Healthcare Quotes For 2014&rdquo; and, to almost no one&rsquo;s surprise, roughly half of them touch of health care reform. That number&rsquo;s even larger if you lump digital health in there, as well.</p><p> My second favorite quote in the piece &ndash; because I&rsquo;ve already written way more than I meant to about  <a href=\"http://www.benefitspro.com/2014/07/08/revisiting-hobby-lobby-fallout\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hobby Lobby </a>  &ndash; is one from Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini.</p><p> &ldquo;Not too far away from now &ndash; in the next six to seven years &ndash; 75 million Americans will be retail buyers of health care,&rdquo; Bertolini told HIMSS14 attendees back in February. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll come to the marketplace with their own money and either a subsidy from their employer or a subsidy from their government. And it doesn&rsquo;t much matter &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be spending their money.&rdquo;</p><p> This is an incredibly revealing quote, which speaks to a reform of health care funding in this nation not necessarily predicated on the involvement of the federal government. Although there&rsquo;s little doubt the feds will always have their hands in that pie. But it&rsquo;s his conclusion that should send spines tingling across the old guard of the benefits business.</p><p> &ldquo;So Aetna&rsquo;s going to have two businesses: One is going to be around ACOs enabling the provider system and the other will be not only creating but driving a consumer healthcare experience because we&rsquo;re that close,&rdquo; Bertolini declared. &ldquo;Connecting the two and [then] standing back and getting out of the way. [We are] creatively destroying the current business model to enable a new one that will have an impact on our healthcare costs.&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s right, the chief executive of one of the country&rsquo;s biggest health insurance carriers just said his company is about to &ldquo;creatively destroy the current business model.&rdquo;</p><p> As frightening as it sounds on first read, it makes a lot of sense, especially if you apply Darwinian theory to economics. There&rsquo;s no way to supplant the status quo without first getting rid of it. You&rsquo;re either the Neanderthal or the homo sapien.</p><p> With that in mind, next week we&rsquo;ll take a closer look at another industry facing a similar seismic shift.</p>",

    "content": "<p> How can we create, or in many cases recreate, an intentional culture of intimacy to enhance productivity? The simplest way to do that is to do something different. Doing things different than before often leads to new perspectives, which usually lead to new opportunities. New opportunities inspire thinking, action, and lead to new production levels.Early in my career, I was attending the top producer's conference for a large regional broker. I was one of 40 fund company representatives presenting to 250 or so top financial advisers-who at that time, were the best of the best. For three days we all sat together and listened as 40 asset managers presented their story and sold their products from the main stage. I can honestly say that out of 40 presentations, 35 were terrible. The two main factors that made me come to that conclusion were: <strong>  1. Presentation Skills: </strong> They lacked the ability to capture and engage the audience. <strong>  2. Content: </strong> The vast majority of presenters focused solely on the performance of their product.I left that conference with two declarations: <strong>  1. I can present better. </strong> <strong>  2. I wouldn't sell based on the performance of a fund. </strong> The first declaration was easy enough to fulfill with study and practice. The second took some serious thought. You see, the old model of presenting was based on a promise, and to be frank, was out of my control. How could I ensure a top-performing fund today, last month, or last year would continue that same way? By selling on performance, I'm giving my advisers the right to fire me if everything doesn't play out as I say. Talk about pressure.I knew I had to figure out a different method to sell in the industry that went beyond the traditional sales model. Having only been on the job for six weeks at that point, I came up with a plan and made my third declaration: <strong>  3. I'm going to help financial advisers be better practitioners, grow their business, and manage their life.   </strong> No small feat, but I was ready. I took on a completely different mindset in my approach to doing business. My focus became less about the product and more about the producer and the culture of the industry itself.What's exciting about this strategy is that many successful companies are doing it today with extraordinary results. Take a look at Google: They have created not only a unique culture, but also a movement. At the core of their business model is that happy employees are productive employees.

    "content": "<p> For the firms that provide financial, wealth, legal and tax advice to high net worth individuals, winning new clients is not something that comes easily or indeed cheaply (just ask the growing number of new online wealth management operators).  In wealth management for example it has been estimated that the resources required to acquire and sign up or onboard clients are 15 to 20 times greater than the resources required to service an established client <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_edn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [i] </a> .The commercial importance of a client retention is clear but is likely to become harder over time. In an increasingly multichannel world with stiffer competition from both traditional and the aforementioned new sources, clients will be - as McKinsey observes &ndash; more &ldquo;open to messages from competitors who will give them a reason to switch <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_edn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [ii] </a> &rdquo;.It&rsquo;s important for firms to understand fully what is going on in their current client base.  A vague attempt to aggregate fee earner/front office feedback is no longer sufficient. &ldquo;Understanding the client&rsquo;s perspective of value is only getting tougher&rdquo; as PWC outlined in its 2013 global private banking and wealth management survey. <strong>  Knowing your place and knowing your client </strong> Wealthy investors spread their assets across multiple firms and financial advisers &ndash; up to 80% may have their assets at more than one firm, with over a quarter spreading investments to four firms or more (see chart below).  <a href=\"https://external.cerulli.com/file.sv?Cerulli-INFO-PACK-2013-HNW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Cerulli Associates </a> <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_edn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [iii] </a>  pegs the average number of provider relationships among the high net worth at 4.4.Firms need to focus on being their clients&rsquo; principle or most &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; adviser to ensure they receive the greater &ldquo;share of wallet&rdquo; rather than becoming expendable.In the short term asking clients for feedback and acting on it immediately demonstrates your clients&rsquo; importance to your business in a tangible way &ndash; making them feel like valued insiders.  Feedback programmes also provide an opportunity to remind clients of everything you do or could do for them - increasing their perception of the value of what you do for them and potentially opening up further/additional conversations leading to uncovering additional needs and/or assets. <strong>  Appealing to the next generation </strong> Traditionally HNW individuals often inherited their advice relationships along with assets bequeathed to them but research studies <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_edn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [iv] </a>  have shown however that as many as half of heirs intend to fire their parents&rsquo; financial adviser. A culture of shopping around and a generation who do not necessarily see their ambitions, tastes, or demographic makeup reflected in their parents&rsquo; advisers will be tempted to make alternative arrangements.Against this background Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in the US was reported earlier this month as &ldquo;actively plotting to recruit female and younger financial advisers&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_edn5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [v] </a> . Financial education for the next generation and embracing social media so that firms are &ldquo;where their clients are&rdquo; are oft quoted partial solutions.I don&rsquo;t dismiss these initiatives but there are no quick fixes but there seems to be a over-reliance on anecdotal evidence such as personal observations amongst younger family members as indicators of future trends - particularly around the changing use of digital tools. Better surely to invest in understanding existing clients&rsquo; wider family dynamics, getting to know the next generation directly and accessing or commissioning robust primary insight and research.Planning on anecdote will be increasingly dangerous as we grope our way forward in the dark towards a future that is unclear - more dialogue with clients and future clients can only help illuminate our way more effectively. <img alt=\"\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1-share-of-wallet.png\" width=\"940\"/> <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_ednref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [i] </a>  Source: The Fiduciary Network, Brave New World of Wealth Management: Opportunities, More competition, Demographics and Growth Conundrums. 2013.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fa-mag.com/news/a-new-game-plan-14085.html?section=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.fiduciarynetwork.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FN_Paper_2013-8LR.pdf  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_ednref2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [ii] </a>  Source: McKinsey, &ldquo;The consumer decision journey.&rdquo; June 2009 by David Court, Dave Elzinga, Susan Mulder, and Ole J&oslash;rgen Vetvik.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_consumer_decision_journey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_consumer_decision_journey  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_ednref3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [iii] </a>  &ldquo;High Net Worth and Ultra High Net Worth Markets 2013: Understanding the Contradictory Demands of Multigenerational Wealth Management. <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_ednref4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [iv] </a> Notably a study in 2009 by the US accounting and professional services firm Rothstein Kass and a 2014 survey by Morgan Stanley and Campden Research which suggested that only half of ultra high net worths under 40 are extremely or very likely to continue using their parents&rsquo; advisor. <a href=\"http://www.acanthusconsulting.co.uk/insights/hold-me-close-dont-let-me-go-the-importance-of-private-client-retention/#_ednref5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [v] </a> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20141110/FREE/141119996/morgan-stanley-seeking-female-and-millennial-advisers-and-clients?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter-newsfromIN&amp;utm_medium=social\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20141110/FREE/141119996/morgan-stanley-seeking-female-and-millennial-advisers-and-clients?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter-newsfromIN&amp;utm_medium=social  </a> </u>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by  <a href=\"http://www.appraisalresources.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jessica May  </u> </a></p><p> We receive countless calls each week from people who own prints and have no idea if they are &ldquo;worth anything&rdquo;. Like any other medium, some prints are extremely valuable and are bought and sold for large sums of money, but many of them only have nominal decorative value. In most cases, there are some steps the owner can take before considering an appraisal.</p><li> Do a Google search. If you know who the artist is or can read a signature and/or title, type them into Google and see what turns up. Because most prints are part of an edition, there is a good chance that a gallery or dealer has listed others from the edition. If this is the case, then you can hopefully obtain current pricing for these prints.</li><li> You can also search websites that report the art market, such as Artnet.com, Askart.com, or Artprice.com. All of these websites compile auction results so that they can be searched by artist. Each website charges a fee for use, but they are very good resources. They all also have separate areas on the website where dealers list works that are for sale.</li><li> If you do not know the artist and/or cannot read the signature on the print, it can be worthwhile to get in touch with a local auction house or one that specializes in prints, such as Swann Galleries. They will often be willing to look at a digital image of the print and, if they can identify it, provide a pre-sale estimate. A pre-sale estimate is usually a range of prices that they think the piece would sell for if they offered it in one of their auctions. If the auction house is unable to identify the print or cannot provide a pre-sale estimate, that usually indicates that the print is more decorative and not appropriate for one of their sales.</li><p> Although we routinely appraise prints, if you are looking to sell the piece or just get an idea of value, an appraisal may not be what you need. You may be able to acquire the information that you seek with just a bit of work on your end.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Corinne Kerston </u></p><p> I know it. You know it. I know you know it. It&rsquo;s something that is said time and time again, sometimes to the point you get nauseous.</p><p> <strong>  Content. Is. King. </strong></p><p> What isn&rsquo;t often said is the stipulation that goes along with this mantra: Good content needs to be marketed. It needs to be marketed in a way that works for your business. So let&rsquo;s talk actionable content marketing tips that you can implement right away.</p><p> <strong>  Tip #1 Identify Your Reader </strong></p><p> Not just, &ldquo;my reader is a home business professional looking to learn about online marketing.&rdquo;</p><p> Nope. That&rsquo;s not enough. You need to be extremely specific.</p><li> What gender is your target reader? What age?</li><li> What does he or she look like?</li><p> You want to be so specific that you can almost picture that person in your mind. Okay, now let&rsquo;s get even more detailed.</p><li> Where does he hang out online? Social media? Forums?</li><li> What types of content does she like to read?</li><li> What is the first thing he does when he gets online? Check email? Facebook? Read the news?</li><li> What is the reason she is coming to your website? What problem does he have that you can help solve with either your information or products?</li><li> What exactly is it going to take to convert her into a paying customer later on down the road?</li><p> With content marketing, you&rsquo;re not trying to please everyone. You want to hone in on yourtarget customer and write with that person in mind.</p><p> <strong>  Tip #2 Set Content Goals </strong></p><p> You set goals for your business, right? You should also set goals for your content marketing. Content is used for a number of things, and you may place more value on some than others.</p><li> Are you using content to get more traffic to your website? More social shares? Comments?</li><li> Are you trying to build your authority and establish trust from your readers?</li><li> Maybe you want to use content to pre-sell your products?</li><p> Think about what your main goal is and craft your content to match your overall goals.</p><p> <strong>  Tip #3 Create an Editorial Calendar </strong></p><p> Do you currently have an editorial calendar? Because you should have one.</p><p> An editorial calendar can be as simple as wall calendar or a planner. But it is essentialbecause it will really help you &ldquo;see&rdquo; your content strategy. Include blog posts and aworking headline if you have one and any guest posts you are writing. Add (or create a separate calendar!) for your social media efforts &ndash; which platform on which day, what types of posts you will share, what groups or communities you will be active in.</p><p> Not only will an editorial calendar help you strategize your overall content marketing, it will help keep your days and weeks organized.</p><p> <strong>  Tip #4 Write for Readers and Search Bots </strong></p><p> Long ago when the SEO began, all anyone talked about was using keywords and writing for search engines. Then Google did some lovely updating and it became a game of &ldquo;write with your reader in mind.&rdquo;</p><p> Let&rsquo;s get daring and write for both.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t keyword stuff, but do include some words and phrases that you know will be searched for. Don&rsquo;t create content just for the links, but do write stuff that offers value and people will want to read and share.</p><p> <strong>  Tip #5 Add a Call to Action </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re not asking your readers to do something, how do you expect them to know what you want them to do?</p><p> At the end of your blog posts, emails, Facebook posts, etc., add some sort of call to action. It can be simply to share the post, or like something. Or it can be to leave a comment, download a free report or sign up for your mailing list.</p><p> Your call to action doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be to purchase something. Quite the opposite in fact. By adding easy (and free!) requests, you are training your audience to do something asked of them so that when you do release new products, they are more likely to click that link or make that purchase.</p><p> <strong>  Tip #6 Have a Killer Freebie </strong></p><p> Since we&rsquo;re talking about asking readers to do something, you want to  <strong>  make it worth their time </strong> . Content marketing isn&rsquo;t all about traffic and social shares; it&rsquo;s about using content to <strong>  entice your readers </strong> .</p><p> Reports, eBooks, email courses, podcasts, white papers, tutorials. Your freebie can be just about anything that will resonate with your ideal reader (remember, the one we profiled in tip #1?) Utilize your freebie to get your reader to sign up for your emails so you can build a list of qualified leads to email whenever you have a new product or service to release.</p><p> Content has long reigned as king when it comes to online marketing. The type of content that works best often changes, and what works for one person may not work for another. To make the most of your content marketing,  <strong>  start taking action </strong> .</p>",

Container, bulk and RoRo (roll on &ndash; roll off) vessels are waiting to unload or pick-up goods at the Port of Seattle. The backup is extending far into Washington&rsquo;s hinterland. For example, in Washington&rsquo;s Yakima Valley, agricultural exporters are piling apples into small mountains because they are unable to ship their product overseas.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/rotting-apples.jpg\" width=\"720\"/></p><p> This is happening as a result of a longshoremen slowdown at west coast ports. We like port credits because of their typically strong balance sheets and sticky business model. Though the current labor dispute is unlikely to impact any of our credits, there is a tectonic shift coming to U.S. ports. The soon-to-be completed Panama Canal expansion will allow post-Panamax vessels to navigate the locks. These super-sized vessels will change the route by which goods enter and exit North America.</p><p> There will be winners and losers in the post-Panamax world. Benefiting most will be east coast ports, as their proximity to large population centers is attractive to shippers. The losers will be west coast ports. The Ports of Long Beach and L.A. should see little impact because of their size and competitive position. However, any excess capacity at Long Beach and L.A. will siphon business from northern competitors such as the Port of Oakland and Port of Seattle. The wildcard in the port sector is the Port of Miami. With the largest cruise line terminal business in the U.S., it is positioning itself as a hub in the post-Panamax world. In anticipation, the Port of Miami has been on a debt binge &ndash; dredging deeper shipping lanes and expanding capacity. Supporting the current high debt load is the cruise line business. The cruise industry is an economically sensitive sector, and the Port of Miami&rsquo;s reliance on a volatile revenue source to pay outstanding debt is a credit concern. As always, we are vigilantly minimizing our exposure to rotten credit apples. </p><p> Sources: SNW Asset Management, Picture Q13 Fox News &ndash; Seattle</p>",

    "title": "Emotive Ideas: Capturing Attention in a Multi-Dimensional World",
    "link": "emotive-ideas-capturing-attention-in-a-multi-dimensional-world",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Kristen Saldarini | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.blissintegrated.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bliss Integrated Communications  </a> </u></p><p> On a typical day, we consume nearly  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/opinion/sunday/hit-the-reset-button-in-your-brain.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   five times  </a> </u>  the amount of information than people did in 1986, which is about 174 newspapers&rsquo; worth of knowledge. This inspires a key question among communication professionals: How does one produce stand-out content to capture consumers&rsquo; attention?</p><p> Furthermore, how can marketing and public relations professionals inspire the brain&rsquo;s &ldquo;attentional&rdquo; filter among consumers&mdash;the neurological tool that tells us what to pay attention to, and what we can safely ignore.</p><p> The answer can get quite emotional.</p><p> By enriching marketing content with elements that not only appeal to the head, but also to the heart, consumers are more likely to pause and ponder the messages being communicated. When marketers develop content that dramatizes the core message through a relatable story, stories will &ldquo;stick,&rdquo; leaving an impression on the desired audience.</p><p> Consider the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjJQBjWYDTs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Like a Girl  </a> </u> &rdquo; ad from P&amp;G&rsquo;s Always. If you don&rsquo;t know it, it aims to alter the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;like a girl,&rdquo; in order raise awareness around pervasive gender stereotypes and counter low self-esteem among the female demographic. A variety of respondents &ndash; an adult man, a young boy, as well as groups of teenage elementary school girls&ndash; are asked to do something &ldquo;like a girl.&rdquo; For example, when the narrator says, &ldquo;Show me what it looks like to run like a girl,&rdquo; the individuals featured in the ad respond by squealing, flailing, or complaining about their hair. &ldquo;Fight like a girl&rdquo; and &ldquo;throw like a girl&rdquo; elicit similar physical displays.</p><p> Personally, I find this video incredibly compelling. It&rsquo;s a creative reveal of how negative stereotypes are internalized&mdash;and become part of our subconscious&mdash;even by the very girls they negatively affect. This campaign demonstrates how emotive ideas successfully capture attention in a multi-dimensional world. As Daniel Pink explains in his book A Whole New Mind, tapping into &ldquo;right-brain&rdquo; qualities, such as inventiveness, empathy, joyfulness and meaning, is often more important than highlighting statistics or raw data.</p><p> Always invites viewers to become emotionally involved in its message. We have seen similar results from McDonalds&rsquo; campaigns for Happy Meals, which focus on highlighting  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-11-08/brands-the-power-of-emotionbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice\">   family moments  </a> </u>  fostered by the fast-food dining experience.</p><p> Ultimately, capturing consumers&rsquo; attention hinges on marketers&rsquo; ability to stimulate feelings of happiness, sadness, fear or anger. &ldquo;Purely emotional&rdquo; content is about twice as powerful as &ldquo;only rational&rdquo; content, according to the  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:https://hbr.org/2014/02/all-work-has-meaning-almost/\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> . More specifically,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courtney-seiter/the-science-of-emotion-in_b_5489567.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   an article  </a> </u>  by Huffington Post Contributor Courtney Seiter explored the biological explanations of the power of emotions, in which people who experienced sadness and produced the hormone oxytocin, which promotes connection and empathy. In another study, participants donated more money to a charity under the influence of oxytocin. Taken together, the studies suggest how inspiring the brain to release oxytocin through emotional messaging can produce empathy and generosity by viewers and, in turn, inspire trust in a product or brand.</p><p> Marketers should not seek to leave audiences with a net zero feeling. Negativity in messaging has a real and lasting effect, specifically when it comes to how content gets shared. A New York Times  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/what-makes-content-go-viral-the-anatomy-of-a-post-that-got-over-500000-likes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  on viral content found that viewers angered by content are more likely to share it, making it go viral. Happiness has a similar effect, according to Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School and author of Contagious: Why Things Catch On. Berger shows that when a marketing campaign  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm%3Fabstract_id=1528077\">   stimulates positivity  </a> </u> , it is more likely to go viral as well.</p><p> Ultimately, Always&rsquo; &ldquo;Like a Girl&rdquo; campaign showcases the importance of shaping narratives with emotion to produce impactful marketing content, making it a useful case study for communication professionals interested in developing actionable narratives on behalf of corporations and products.</p>",

    "link": "aging-clients-how-financial-advisors-can-succeed-in-difficult-conversations",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s a fact of life. None of us are getting any younger. Life marches on and cognitive disabilities can set in. Financial advisors can spot dementia if properly trained. In addition, they can stop their older clients from harming themselves financially &ndash; and from claiming the advisor (or others close them in their personal life) had something to do with their undoing.</p><p> The legal and compliance risks to an advisor&rsquo;s practice are very real. Forward-thinking advisors will ramp up their skills now.</p><p> <strong>  WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF THE CLIENT&rsquo;S COGNITIVE DECLINE </strong></p><p> Financial advisors may notice the warning signs ofcognitive decline in a client for some time. When they conclude that their aging client is getting to the point when he or she is unable to safely manage financial decisions any longer, the time will come when someone must take over for the client. Typically a responsible client has an estate plan and someone is appointed as the client&rsquo;s successor.</p><p> One important step for the advisor is to find out if the client has indeed created an estate plan with a provision for a successor. It may be a successor trustee for a family trust or it may be an agent on a Durable Power of Attorney. Sometimes, for many reasons, even otherwise responsible people just don&rsquo;t get their estate planning done.  If the client has not accomplished the estate planing needed, this is a step the advisor can take that will protect both the client and the advisory firm. The advisor, with the help of their legal and compliance department can develop an institution-specific document that allows the client to appoint the appropriate successor to take his or her place for management decisions over the funds the advisor controls and to waive his or her right to privacy with that appointed agent. This is essential. The advisor can&rsquo;t do the job of protecting the client without it.</p><p> Once the advisor is informed about the agent the client has appointed to take the reins in the event of his or her incapacity, the advisor needs to take the initiative for the next steps.  </p><p> <strong>  FOUR CRITICAL THINGS TO DO WHEN A TRANSITION OF POWER IS NEAR </strong></p><p> Here are four critical things a smart and ethical financial advisor can do to make the transition more likely to succeed:</p><li> <strong>  Recognize and acknowledge that this transition of power is difficult for anyone. </strong></li><p> &ldquo;If the client, whom you may have known over decades, has been a powerful person in his or her life, and has been &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; in one way or another, giving up the status and position of being in charge will never be easy. Let the client know that you understand this,&rdquo; said Rosenblatt.</p><p> &ldquo;Communicate that your effort is to protect his hard work and the prudent decisions he has made over the time you have known him,&rdquo; said Dr. Davis. &ldquo;This acknowledgement lets him know that you respect that this is emotionally trying for him. The trust he has in you will help you both.&rdquo;</p><li> <strong>  Set up a face-to-face meeting, if possible, with your client and his or her successor.   </strong></li><p> &ldquo;The time should be chosen carefully,&rdquo; warns Dr. Davis. &ldquo;Be sure that there are no immediately stressful life events going on with your client that might distract from the importance of the meeting. An illness, loss of a spouse or family member, a divorce or other traumatic incident will absorb your client&rsquo;s attention and could interfere with your effort to succeed.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Find out how your client is doing in general, and select the right time accordingly,&rdquo; underscores Rosenblatt.</p><li> <strong>  Choose the place for a meeting carefully. </strong>  </li><p> &ldquo;Your aging client is already dealing with loss of control, probably in more ways than financially,&rdquo; Rosenblatt continued. &ldquo;If you have observed obvious changes in your client over time, there are likely other parts of his life that are a problem too.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Let him choose where to meet. Do what you can to ensure that he is comfortable and that there is privacy. Encourage him to tell you about his concerns and fears in arranging the meeting. Be an excellent listener,&rdquo; advises Dr. Davis.</p><li> <strong>  Expect resistance and do advance planning on how to manage it.   </strong></li><p> &ldquo;No one wants to think of herself as being too old to do what she has always done,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said.</p><p> &ldquo;No one will relish the idea of a difficult meeting in which she must acknowledge that she has to yield control over finances,&rdquo; echoes Dr. Davis. &ldquo;Vulnerability is the result.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;If your client pushes back at the suggestion of a meeting, let her know that you understand why she might not want to have it but that it is going to be necessary, and soon. Set a date for follow up. Don&rsquo;t push too hard, but gently persist,&rdquo; Rosenblatt emphasized.</p><p> <strong>  IN CONCLUSION </strong></p><p> Aging clients will very likely need someone to assist with financial management eventually. This is something to plan for as an expected development, rather than a &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; or unlikely possibility. Financial advisors who are prepared for how to handle the potential transition of control can help to ensure their clients are protected from dangerous money decisions that arise from cognitive impairment. Astute financial advisors will be prepared to manage any transition as gracefully as possible.</p>",

We will also see an increase in contingent workers who will change how work is done.</p><p> What can we expect in 2015?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12015-predictions1.jpg\" width=\"1009\"/></p><p> Here are seven trends 21st century organizations are leading in:</p><li> <strong>  Re-imagining our relationship with work. </strong>  Not only is the world changing quickly, but work as we know it is also making some changes that will become more significant in 2015, which is a year of transformation. In Canada, we will still see many work environments that require 9 to 5 workdays but in other parts of the world, there will be a vast increase in the need for flexible schedules, when possible, because it&rsquo;s what knowledge workers want. In 2015, 21st century leaders will take the opportunity to re-examine what work means to their employees. It&rsquo;s time to shelve the annual employee survey and introduce ongoing two-way communication into the workplace. The only way to re-imagine work is to adopt the 21st century tool of conversation and say goodbye to the 20th century world of meetings for the sake of meetings. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Realizing that people are the killer app for the 21st century. </strong>  And no, &ldquo;people&rdquo; is not the name of a new app. It is the realization that we need to stop thinking about headcount and start realizing that our workplaces will require human beings to get work done. Organizations that build teams around shared purpose will find their business flourishing as thousands of unnecessary hours will no longer be wasted on endless meetings and information sharing. People will actually understand how their role drives a shared purpose&ndash; their ability to collaborate with others to drive results. The 21st century leader will simplify work and create opportunities for greater collaboration. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Stopping the insanity: It&rsquo;s not about the technology.  </strong> CIOs need to continue to be proactive around changing security and mobility demands that the workforce will place on their infrastructure. They will also need to experience a mindset shift in 2015 on how to use technology as an enabler of the business and to stop leading with technology. People in 2015 will expect the technology to work and will want the same ease they have outside the workplace to connect with colleagues inside their organizations. They will need to be increasingly educated about security. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Building   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/blog/building-connected-networks-is-the-most-important-skill-of-the-21st-century/51052\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    connected networks   </a>  </u>   is key to survival. </strong>  Most leaders in large organizations do not know what talent they have within their organizations, and the same top performers continuously get rewarded with more work and special projects. As the contingent workforce increases and more employees will choose to become free agents, it will be increasingly challenging to find people with strategic skill sets. Using existing social networks as an enabler to creating relationships will become increasingly important.  What&rsquo;s old, like creating trust and building relationships, will become new again. Connected networks will also become increasingly important to build trusted communities of employees, where collaboration can accelerate the business. Partnerships with customers will also become increasingly important, as some will seek more personalized experiences. It&rsquo;s time for business to start learning from the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2014/12/07/collaborative-economy-honeycomb-2-watch-it-grow/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sharing economy  </a> </u> . As that economy goes mainstream, an increasing number of people will share their expertise, their stuff, and work in a new form of collaboration. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Senior leaders will start incorporating into their strategies the need for new ways of working. </strong>  They will understand that changing demographics like the younger generation should be viewed as an opportunity to innovate how we work instead of exacerbating their stress levels. My hope is that we will shift from focusing on platforms and bring back business common sense when it comes to how these platforms can help us realize our shared purpose. We will adopt methodologies like &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/section/working-out-loud-b63XLZ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Working Out Loud  </a> </u> &rdquo; and reduce our reliance on email. We need to think about what mobile devices and applications allow us to do, like having the flexibility to work from anywhere. The 21st century leader will know the world is open and that social networks facilitate collaboration between billions of people. We live in an open world and it is as big or small as our imagination. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Human collaboration is making an important comeback to the world of work. </strong>  If you are in healthcare, for example, patient-centricity will become increasingly important with organizations trying to be more empathetic to  patients&rsquo; needs as we move towards more personalized medicine. Organizations will continue to integrate human-centred design and it will no longer be a buzzword, but will become a business model to develop innovative, real-time solutions for real world problems. The 21st century leader will have the design capabilities to bring agility and nimbleness to the workplace by listening and becoming more responsive to a personalized world. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Lifeworking will replace the fallacy of work-life balance. </strong> Both the younger generation and people in their 40s, 50s and 60s will start shifting their notions of how work fits into their lives. An increasing number of people will want to bring who they are to work, which will require 21st century organizations to introduce new programs from flexible schedules. It will also mean organizations will need to know how to access the best talent inside and outside the organization. Technology can increasingly enable organizations to meet the increasing needs of lifeworking. The 21st century leader will realize that we can no longer leave our personal selves at home and he or she will value a new world definition of diversity. <br/>  </li><p> How will you lead the 21st century organization in 2015?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Wriiten by: <a href=\"http://kevinrcain.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kevin Cain  </u> </a></p><p> I recently read about  <u>  Michigan&rsquo;s Lake Superior State University&rsquo;s annual list of overused words and phrases </u>  that students deem worthy of banishment from the English language. Among recent offenders were some tried-and-true favorites (ginormous and man cave to name a couple), as well as relative newcomers to our daily vernacular such as selfie and twerking.</p><p> All in all it&rsquo;s not a bad list, but it seems to me that our friends at LSSU missed an obvious target. I&rsquo;m talking about 17 letters that can be combined to form what has become a ubiquitous and, frankly, increasingly clich&eacute; term: thought leadership.</p><p> Among content marketers, few words are so widely batted around or have generated greater buzz. As more and more people proclaim their content to be thought leadership, the term&rsquo;s meaning has become diluted. These days, anyone with an opinion and a pulse can claim to be a thought leader, requiring little more than an internet connection to start publishing their so-called thought leadership.</p><p> No m&aacute;s!</p><p> It&rsquo;s time to take a more critical look at what thought leadership really is. Maybe we need the thought leadership equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal of approval: a set of criteria to separate what&rsquo;s often passed off as thought leadership from the real deal. The minimum requirements for earning that seal of approval would include ensuring that your content:</p><p> <strong>  Offers bold ideas that are new and noteworthy </strong></p><p> To drive thought leadership, content either needs to put forth new ideas or provide fresh insights into old ones. Simply regurgitating what others have already written or said, while sometimes useful in its own right, isn&rsquo;t a recipe for success. Don&rsquo;t have anything new to say? Then sit tight until you do and remember that sometimes less is more. Producing one piece of thought leadership content that really says something innovative and bold is a much better strategy than publishing a dozen pieces that don&rsquo;t say anything at all.</p><p> One of my favorite examples of a real thought leader who provides bold ideas is Bob Reynolds, the president and CEO of Putnam Investments. Mr. Reynolds does an admirable job, consistently producing insightful and provocative articles in his blog, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.theretirementsavingschallenge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Retirement Savings Challenge  </u>  . </a> &rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Takes a stand and presents a clear point of view </strong></p><p> Leaders shouldn&rsquo;t sit on the fence, so make sure that your content offers a definitive point of view. Putting a stake in the ground can mean taking risks, but if all your content does is toe the line, it doesn&rsquo;t qualify as thought leadership. This is often a particular challenge for big corporations. Concerned that they might alienate a part of their customer base, some corporations shy away from taking a stand. Unfortunately, doing so turns their content into factual reporting, rather than providing insightful thought leadership.</p><p> <strong>  Utilizes high-quality (preferably original) research </strong></p><p> Sometimes content that&rsquo;s floated around as thought leadership can come across like a high school term paper. You can help avoid that pitfall by making sure that you&rsquo;re using the best sources and respected research. Use online tools like LexisNexis to direct you to high-quality news articles and industry reports, rather than turning to the likes of Wikipedia or Yahoo News (both are fine resources, but not ones that you should be citing in your thought leadership efforts). Ideally, your content will also reflect your own research (conducted in-house or commissioned through a third party), which will help guarantee that you really do have something unique to say.</p><p> <strong>  Is very credible </strong></p><p> Your thought leadership efforts will fall flat if your content isn&rsquo;t credible. Help ensure that all of your work is accurate and logical by thoroughly fact-checking it. You can also raise the caliber of your content by collaborating with people who are well known and respected in your industry. One way to do this is by soliciting influencers or subject matter experts to write a foreword to your next white paper or provide quotes for your next report. If you don&rsquo;t have access to anyone who fits the bill, you can build up your own credibility by looking for opportunities to contribute content to other places and building a name for yourself over time.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also important to remember that no one is an expert in everything. Stick to creating content that falls into your sweet spot, rather than trying to pontificate on subject matter that&rsquo;s beyond your realm of expertise. For example, in his blog for Putnam, Bob Reynolds can get very political. When he does, however, his posts are limited to news from Capital Hill that pertains to retirement savings issues, not U.S. foreign policy or gun control. </p><p> <strong>  It has to be forward looking </strong></p><p> The best thought leadership efforts don&rsquo;t just look at present situations, but also help forecast the future. If your content offers informed predictions about how things will be at some point in the future, it&rsquo;s going to stand out. See if there are ways that you can use current data to forecast future trends or make other predictions that your readers will find useful.</p><p> So tell me, do your thought leadership efforts pass the test, or are we making a ginormous mistake by not retiring this overused phrase?</p>",

    "link": "8-tricks-to-appear-like-an-important-vc",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://christinetsai.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Christine Tsai  </u> </a></p><p> [Inspired by  <u>  <a href=\"http://thecooperreview.com/how-to-email-15-tricks-to-appear-smart-in-emails/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sarah Cooper&rsquo;s infamous lists  </a> </u> , here&rsquo;s my attempt at one. I&rsquo;m too lazy to come up with 10, so there are only 8 here]</p><p> All VCs are not created equal. Some are clearly more important than others. If you&rsquo;re a VC and need help appearing more important to founders and other VCs, here are a few handy tips to quickly gain the upper hand.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Namedrop notable founders and investors using only their first name. </strong></p><p> A surefire way to look well-connected and important is to reference reputable investors or founders by first name. &ldquo;Chamath would be really interested in that company.&rdquo; Even better if you reference founders whose companies haven&rsquo;t achieved unicorn status, and say it with confidence. This makes people shift uncomfortably in their seat, thinking they should know who this person is.</p><p> <strong>  2. Be late to meetings, or better yet - reschedule meetings at the last minute. </strong></p><p> Nothing will show your importance more than running late to a meeting, because it shows that your time (e.g. YOU) are in high demand. Always blame it on a board meeting running late. </p><p> <strong>  3. Keep your email autoresponder on at all times.  </strong></p><p> Even when you&rsquo;re not traveling or out of the office, and even if you get only a few emails a day, a persistent autoresponse immediately communicates that you receive way too many pitches and inquiries from founders to respond to all of them personally. </p><p> <strong>  4. Congratulate people publicly on their funding or acquisition announcements. </strong></p><p> Companies announce fundraising or acquisitions. Firms announce they&rsquo;ve raised another fund. This is the time to publicly congratulate the news on Facebook and/or Twitter. It will make you look like you know these people personally (and thus are an important VC). Be sure to tweet the news as soon as it breaks, so it looks like you&rsquo;re in the know - or better yet, like you knew it was going to happen. </p><p> <strong>  5. Criticize other VCs for not being founder friendly. </strong></p><p> An easy way to win the hearts of founders everywhere is to proclaim yourself and your firm &ldquo;founder friendly.&rdquo; Take that a step further and publicly call out other VCs for not being founder friendly. Instant cred.</p><p> <strong>  6. Joke about how valuations are too high.  </strong></p><p> Or joke about any topic, really - the market being too frothy, startups raising too much money, founders being too greedy, etc. In doing so, you immediately appear like a VC who&rsquo;s done so many deals that you know what&rsquo;s hot. No matter what the issue, it&rsquo;s important to have a very firm public opinion on it even if you are neutral on the issue or don&rsquo;t actually know much about it. </p><p> <strong>  7. Hold meetings at a non-mainstream coffee shop. </strong></p><p> Nothing screams &ldquo;basic b*tch VC&rdquo; more than when you choose a meeting location and it&rsquo;s Starbucks or Peet&rsquo;s. Pick a coffee shop that&rsquo;s not a chain but saturated with important VCs and founders. In downtown Palo Alto, recommended choices are Coupa Cafe and Philz. In doing so, you&rsquo;ll rest assured that important VCs and founders will see you there and you will be viewed as an important VC by association. Bonus points if you snap a photo of your coffee drink and your whereabouts on Instagram/Twitter/Swarm. </p><p> <strong>  8. Lament about deals you passed on that are now $1B companies. </strong></p><p> Be it Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, or Dropbox, important VCs all would have had a chance to invest in their seed rounds. The only thing better than having actually invested in these unicorns is having passed on those deals. Then you can publicly lament about how you passed on the deal. Admitting such failure won&rsquo;t make you look bad. To the contrary, it&rsquo;ll make you look like you are important enough to have gotten such an opportunity. A bit of public self-deprecation perpetuates just the right amount of self-confidence. By calling yourself an idiot who passed on Airbnb when it was &lt; $10M valuation, you look baller. </p><p> BONUS!:</p><p> <strong>  9. Predict the future. </strong></p><p> Every important VC is able to predict the future. Take a stab at predicting trends (&ldquo;Marketplaces are going to blow up in 2015&rdquo;) or specific transactions (&ldquo;Slack is going to raise an even bigger round next year&rdquo;). The more vague, the better because then you increase your chances of being right and patting yourself on the back on Twitter. Just like #6, the key is to declare these with the utmost confidence. </p>",

    "content": "<p> We had a hard time finding this article written by Bill Gates in 1996, so we thought we'd share. Enjoy. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Bill Gates  <br/>  Content is King </strong> <br/> <strong>  1/3/1996 </strong></p><p> Content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting.</p><p> The television revolution that began half a century ago spawned a number of industries, including the manufacturing of TV sets, but the long-term winners were those who used the medium to deliver information and entertainment.</p><p> When it comes to an interactive network such as the Internet, the definition of &ldquo;content&rdquo; becomes very wide. For example, computer software is a form of content-an extremely important one, and the one that for Microsoft will remain by far the most important.</p><p> But the broad opportunities for most companies involve supplying information or entertainment. No company is too small to participate.</p><p> One of the exciting things about the Internet is that anyone with a PC and a modem can publish whatever content they can create. In a sense, the Internet is the multimedia equivalent of the photocopier. It allows material to be duplicated at low cost, no matter the size of the audience.</p><p> The Internet also allows information to be distributed worldwide at basically zero marginal cost to the publisher. Opportunities are remarkable, and many companies are laying plans to create content for the Internet.</p><p> For example, the television network NBC and Microsoft recently agreed to enter the interactive news business together. Our companies will jointly own a cable news network, MSNBC, and an interactive news service on the Internet. NBC will maintain editorial control over the joint venture.</p><p> I expect societies will see intense competition-and ample failure as well as success-in all categories of popular content-not just software and news, but also games, entertainment, sports programming, directories, classified advertising, and on-line communities devoted to major interests.</p><p> Printed magazines have readerships that share common interests. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine these communities being served by electronic online editions.</p><p> But to be successful online, a magazine can&rsquo;t just take what it has in print and move it to the electronic realm. There isn&rsquo;t enough depth or interactivity in print content to overcome the drawbacks of the online medium.</p><p> If people are to be expected to put up with turning on a computer to read a screen, they must be rewarded with deep and extremely up-to-date information that they can explore at will. They need to have audio, and possibly video. They need an opportunity for personal involvement that goes far beyond that offered through the letters-to-the-editor pages of print magazines.</p><p> A question on many minds is how often the same company that serves an interest group in print will succeed in serving it online. Even the very future of certain printed magazines is called into question by the Internet.</p><p> For example, the Internet is already revolutionizing the exchange of specialized scientific information. Printed scientific journals tend to have small circulations, making them high-priced. University libraries are a big part of the market. It&rsquo;s been an awkward, slow, expensive way to distribute information to a specialized audience, but there hasn&rsquo;t been an alternative.</p><p> Now some researchers are beginning to use the Internet to publish scientific findings. The practice challenges the future of some venerable printed journals.</p><p> Over time, the breadth of information on the Internet will be enormous, which will make it compelling. Although the gold rush atmosphere today is primarily confined to the United States, I expect it to sweep the world as communications costs come down and a critical mass of localized content becomes available in different countries.</p><p> For the Internet to thrive, content providers must be paid for their work. The long-term prospects are good, but I expect a lot of disappointment in the short-term as content companies struggle to make money through advertising or subscriptions. It isn&rsquo;t working yet, and it may not for some time.</p><p> So far, at least, most of the money and effort put into interactive publishing is little more than a labor of love, or an effort to help promote products sold in the non-electronic world. Often these efforts are based on the belief that over time someone will figure out how to get revenue.</p><p> In the long run, advertising is promising. An advantage of interactive advertising is that an initial message needs only to attract attention rather than convey much information. A user can click on the ad to get additional information-and an advertiser can measure whether people are doing so.</p><p> But today the amount of subscription revenue or advertising revenue realized on the Internet is near zero-maybe $20 million or $30 million in total. Advertisers are always a little reluctant about a new medium, and the Internet is certainly new and different.</p><p> Some reluctance on the part of advertisers may be justified, because many Internet users are less-than-thrilled about seeing advertising. One reason is that many advertisers use big images that take a long time to download across a telephone dial-up connection. A magazine ad takes up space too, but a reader can flip a printed page rapidly.</p><p> As connections to the Internet get faster, the annoyance of waiting for an advertisement to load will diminish and then disappear. But that&rsquo;s a few years off.</p><p> Some content companies are experimenting with subscriptions, often with the lure of some free content. It&rsquo;s tricky, though, because as soon as an electronic community charges a subscription, the number of people who visit the site drops dramatically, reducing the value proposition to advertisers.</p><p> A major reason paying for content doesn&rsquo;t work very well yet is that it&rsquo;s not practical to charge small amounts. The cost and hassle of electronic transactions makes it impractical to charge less than a fairly high subscription rate.</p><p> But within a year the mechanisms will be in place that allow content providers to charge just a cent or a few cents for information. If you decide to visit a page that costs a nickel, you won&rsquo;t be writing a check or getting a bill in the mail for a nickel. You&rsquo;ll just click on what you want, knowing you&rsquo;ll be charged a nickel on an aggregated basis.</p><p> This technology will liberate publishers to charge small amounts of money, in the hope of attracting wide audiences.</p><p> Those who succeed will propel the Internet forward as a marketplace of ideas, experiences, and products-a marketplace of content.</p><p> This essay is copyright &copy; 2001 Microsoft Corporation.

    "content": "<p> Finom works only with independent Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs).  We believe independent RIAs provide better and more diverse service, face fewer conflicts of interest, and fulfill a higher level of fiduciary duty to their clients.   </p><p> An RIA is an entity who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others on investments in securities.  Independent RIAs are not affiliated with a larger financial firm or organization; they are typically individuals or small groups.  RIAs are registered either with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or with one or more States, and are regulated by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_Advisers_Act_of_1940\" target=\"_blank\">   Investment Advisory Act of 1940  </a> </u>  or by state securities laws as applicable.  The investment professionals at an RIA who provide investment advisory services are called Investment Adviser Representatives (IAR).  These representatives are typically registered with the States in which they have a place of business, and typically have passed appropriate certification examinations (typically the Series 65 Exam, or a combination of Series 7 and 66 Exams). </p><p> The basic difference between an RIA and a non-RIA (such as the investment management arm of a bank, wirehouse, or broker-dealer) is the fiduciary obligation owed by RIAs to their clients.  By law, RIAs are fiduciaries of their clients; as fiduciaries, they must place the client&rsquo;s interests before their own in all circumstances.  RIAs must, for example, select a brokerage firm, choose a sub-adviser, give asset allocation advice, or trade securities in a client account, with the interest of the client foremost in mind.  This fiduciary obligation is especially important when the interests of the client and adviser are at odds. </p><p> Non-RIA investment professionals (at a bank, wirehouse, or broker-dealer) need not meet this fiduciary standard.  Instead, they only face a suitability standard; they are not required to choose the best investment for you, but only a suitable one.  A broker-dealer representative is free to recommend an investment that offers yields him the greatest commission revenue, but is far from the &ldquo;best&rdquo; investment for your goals and circumstances.  (Read more on fiduciary vs. suitability standards  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fpanet.org/ToolsResources/ArticlesBooksChecklists/Articles/FinancialPlanning/FiduciaryvsSuitabilityWhichstandardisbest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .)</p><p> The starkly different compensation regimes (in both source and structure of payment) of RIAs versus non-RIAs reflect their unequal obligations.  Independent RIAs (like those we feature on Finom) are almost exclusively &ldquo;fee-only&rdquo; advisers, compensated as a percentage of your assets under their management.  Broker-dealers and other non-RIAs, on the other hand, are primarily compensated through commissions derived from products they sell to investors.  Further, RIA clients typically pay brokerage and transaction costs separately; occasionally they are lumped in with advisory fees as a &lsquo;wrapped&rsquo; fee.  In those rare instances where RIAs on Finom are also broker-dealers, any conflicts of interest are disclosed and addressed in the RIA's ADV brochure.  [Click  <u>  here </u>  more on whether investment advisers are worth the fees they charge.] </p><p> Independent RIAs therefore have no incentive to &ldquo;push&rdquo; specific products or services on to you; they are free to make decisions as your fiduciary, in your stead, with your interests foremost in mind.  Non-RIAs, however, may place your assets in products that earn them the most commission revenue, just as long as they are &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; for your circumstances based on a cursory review. </p><p> Finally, independent RIAs (unlike broker-dealers and large banks) typically know their clients personally, often over long period of time, sometimes across generations.  As independent RIAs, advisers on Finom tend to be strategic advisers to families and institutions, and trusted stewards of their investment wealth.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve been immersed in the world of employee engagement dating back at least 20 years, only back then we referred to it as employee satisfaction. Those were the days in HR when we all did an annual survey to assess how people felt about their jobs and thought the best way to do this was through a 65+ multiple choice questionnaire and lots of room to write any comment you wanted.  No subject was off limits from how you felt about your senior leadership to your direct supervisor, career development and compensation and benefits.  My personal favorite was asking if you were satisfied with the amount of compensation you received. Really? Who in their right mind would say yes except for the CEO.</p><p> Thankfully a number of years ago the Gallup organization got smart and turned the focus to solely asking about employee engagement and limiting the questions to 12.  So much easier to administer and quicker to get reports back, but more importantly it made us look at the right things when it came to our employees. You don&rsquo;t need to be satisfied or happy to be engaged. Frankly, some of the most engaged people I know are not satisfied with the status quo and are working hard to create a better environment for themselves and their colleagues. Now that&rsquo;s engagement!</p><p> Throughout my years of experience in corporate human resources, there&rsquo;s always been a thread of work for me that centered on engagement, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I started my own business and wrote my book &ldquo;Coming Alive: The Journey To Reengage Your Life And Career&rdquo; that I became an Engagement Evangelist. I knew that this is where I was supposed to be and couldn&rsquo;t wait to be a driver of awareness and change. There was no way I wanted to be in the back seat on this important issue.</p><p> As I look back on the past 18 months since Gallup released their updated state of the workplace study, it&rsquo;s clear how many people have jumped on the engagement bandwagon. The number of people claiming to be experts in this area and the volume of material that&rsquo;s now available online is staggering.  None of us are truly experts on engagement, except maybe for Gallup, but many of us bring great minds to the issue and all want the same thing, to create a workplace that allows employees to be passionate about what they do and why they do it. </p><p> It&rsquo;s clear the bandwagon is just about filled to capacity but there is always room for one more passenger who believes that engagement is the key to business success as I do.  I recently saw a feature story on Tony Robbins, the great motivational speaker in Fortune magazine. He&rsquo;s got a new book out on finance, but in the article they mention his new passion and I&rsquo;m sure you can guess what it is&hellip; employee engagement. I had to laugh when I saw this and said hey, I&rsquo;m in good company.  A few weeks later I opened up the December issue of Costco Connections magazine in which my work is featured and lo and behold who else is in there, the aforementioned Tony Robbins, only this time it&rsquo;s about his new personal finance book. </p><p> While I may not teach people how to walk across hot coals as Tony does, I do focus on getting people to look in the mirror and face up to their own feelings about the work they do and how much passion they either have or don&rsquo;t have for it.</p><p> My goal for 2015 is to continue to drive the bus.  Others will continue to hop on and offer their advice, and that&rsquo;s great, but not many of them can truthfully say they have gone through this personally like I have.</p><p> If you want to be driven on the journey towards high engagement, then why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to do this with an authentic and credible guide? Give me a call at 415-308-3344 or reach out to me at ruth@rsquaredresources and ride with someone who is driving the employee engagement conversation.</p>",

While many will dismiss this as the wishful thinking of an industrial dinosaur, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that 25 years isn&rsquo;t that long of a timeframe in the automotive world.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gasgraph.png\" width=\"450\"/></p><p> As we speak, automakers are already planning for what products will be on the market within the next decade. As it stands now, they must meet increasingly stringent emissions targets in the United States and the European union by 2025, in the form of both CAFE and the next round of Euro regulations that call for a fleet average of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer (for comparison, a Toyota Prius emits about 100 grams per km).</p><p> One way of meeting this target is through the use of hybrid technology &ndash; a sector that ExxonMobil sees as making rapid, substantial gains over the years. At this point, every single OEM has some kind of hybrid technology that can be adapted to their volume models in a way that is efficient in terms of both packaging and cost. This is sure to be the case for plug-in hybrid technology as well.</p><p> The zero-emissions front is substantially more fraught. The battle between battery electric vehicles (BEV) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles has barely begun, but supporters of the two camps are already locked into a Betamax vs. VHS style conflict. As it stands, there is minimal infrastructure for both systems, and a combination of low oil prices and consumer skepticism is likely to stall its growth for the foreseeable future. And while BEVs technically have a head start on hydrogen, their market share is, in real terms, negligible.</p><p> In 2013, BEVs had a market share of just 0.28 percent, or about 260,000 units. Even the relatively scarce plug-in hybrid segment managed to best pure electrics, with 0.31 percent of the new car market. Only in Norway, where BEVs receive heavy subsidies in the form of tax breaks, have electric cars made any real headway, and even then, they have barely cracked 6 percent.</p><p> While tales of daring and disruption and averting cataclysmic climate change make for great headlines, the reality is that technological progress, especially in the automotive sector, moves at a much more gradual pace &ndash; otherwise, we&rsquo;d likely have seen a major breakthrough in EV battery technology by now, one that would allow for significant range and negligible refueling times. Utopian visions of a fleet of silent, zero-emissions vehicles are just that. Instead, we are likely to see a proliferation of hybrid technology throughout new model lineups &ndash; and much of this will likely be driven by regulatory inputs, as a means of helping vehicles meet government mandated fuel economy targets, even if consumers don&rsquo;t necessarily care.</p><p> Advances in the internal combustion engine are also on the horizon. Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines, which allow for diesel-like combustion while running on gasoline, are expected to debut on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.autonews.com/article/20140106/OEM06/301069997/mazda-pins-improved-mpg-on-skyactiv-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mazda cars by 2020  </a> </u> . Mazda claims that they will provide a 30 percent fuel economy boost, while significantly lowering emissions. Between HCCI, increasingly cleaner diesel engines and incremental improvements to traditional engines, the ICE powertrains are likely to be ubiquitous due to their familiarity and what is sure to be a cost advantage. Barring any major, prolonged spike in energy prices or a wholesale shift in attitudes towards climate change and the environment, dollars and cents (not to mention sheer convenience) will remain the primary motivating factor in new car purchases. And that means that the internal combustion engine is well placed to continue its dominance through the next quarter century.</p>",

Especially since I was in the &ldquo;baby boomer&rdquo; generation, and we were going to change the world!</p><p> So here I am now feeling the same way toward my son. He feels that &ldquo;Parks and Recreation&rdquo; is far superior to &ldquo;All in the Family&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s laughable to compare the new &ldquo;Godzilla&rdquo; to the Japanese versions I so loved.</p><p> Although he may have a point, I know that there&rsquo;s one thing that my generation does that the younger one can&rsquo;t hold a candle to &mdash; investing and saving.</p><p> Look at how these kids throw money away. Don&rsquo;t they know that things will be so difficult for them in the future, that they need to start saving NOW? This advice seems to go nowhere when there&rsquo;s a new videogame or smartphone that has to be purchased. How will this group called &ldquo;millennials&rdquo; ever survive with their poor saving and investing habits?</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2014/07/31/94933/why-millennials-arent-saving-for-retirement-and-what-we-can-do-to-change-that/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent article  </a> </u>  points out that it&rsquo;s very difficult for millennials to save for retirement for these four reasons:</p><li> High youth unemployment</li><li> Stagnant wages and the middle-class squeeze</li><li> Massive student debt</li><li> Poor quality retirement plans</li><p> As a member of the baby boomer generation, I&rsquo;m feeling pessimistic about the prospects for millennials to have the money and resources they need to live in this harsh financial landscape that we&rsquo;re in today.</p><p> The &ldquo;saving&rdquo; grace in this entire situation may be that where the baby boom generation is used to the pessimistic doom-and-gloom view of the world, contrary to what we believe, we&rsquo;re actually seeing millennials take a more optimistic and &ldquo;glass half-filled&rdquo; approach to their future.</p><p> Although millennials recognize that concerns such as student debt are significant hindrances to saving, they have also learned from events such as the recession of 2008, they value the need to &ldquo; <u>  save now to survive economic trouble down the road </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> It seems that millennials have learned much from entering the workforce during the great recession.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.transamericacenter.org/docs/default-source/resources/center-research/tcrs2014_sr_millennials.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A recent study by Transamerica  </a> </u>  shows that millennials believe that they are &ldquo;much more likely&rdquo; to recover economically from this event that Generation X and baby boomers. This may be due to their being in the workforce for a shorter period and having a longer time horizon in which to save. Or it may be due to their overall optimism to survive and thrive through difficult times.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.transamericacenter.org/docs/default-source/resources/center-research/tcrs2014_sr_millennials.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  shows that &ldquo;two-thirds (68 %) of Millennial workers are &lsquo;very&rsquo; or &lsquo;somewhat&rsquo; confident that they will be able to someday fully retire with a comfortable lifestyle, demonstrating higher levels of confidence than Generation X or baby boomers.&rdquo;</p><p> The study also shows that millennials know that retirement will look much different for them than it does for their parents. Most view retirement in a &ldquo;phased&rdquo; approach in which they &ldquo;will continue to work, reduce hours with more leisure time to enjoy life, or work in a different capacity that is less demanding and/or brings greater personal satisfaction.&rdquo;</p><p> Many millennials plan to work in retirement, not only for reasons of income and benefits, but because they want to stay involved or enjoy what they do. In fact the study shows that millennials are &ldquo;significantly more likely to plan to work for reasons of enjoyment compared with Generation X and baby boomers.&rdquo;</p><p> Contrary to what we believe, millennials aren&rsquo;t sticking their heads in the sand about retirement.</p><p> Catherine Collinson, president of Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciaadamczyk/2014/07/17/millennials-save-for-retirement-earlier-than-baby-boomers-survey-finds/\" target=\"_blank\">   notes that  </a> </u> , &ldquo;Our research found that three out of four are already discussing saving, investing, and planning for retirement with family and friends. In fact, millennials are twice as likely to frequently discuss retirement compared with their parents&rsquo; generation.&rdquo;</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t only communication but their overall interest and attention to addressing their financial future. A  <u>  Wells Fargo study on millennials </u>  found that the majority of them (53%) think about their financial future daily, which is signicantly more than boomers at 40%.</p><p> The  <u>  Wells Fargo study </u>  also reiterates the optimism of millennials about their future as nearly three quarters (72%) feel that they will be able to save enough for their future lifestyle as compared with the more pessimistic view of boomers at 64%.</p><p> As  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2014/09/03/are-millennials-really-super-savers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alicia Munnell reported in her recent article on MarketWatch  </a> </u>  on this topic, many of us in the retirement field are surprised by the attention and actions of millennials to saving and planning for their future, as found through these recent studies. As Alicia says, the findings that millennials are saving at a younger age than those in the baby boomer generation &ldquo;flies in the face of our fears and seems to be good news.&rdquo;</p><p> It is good news, and maybe even those boomers like me, who view the future of younger generations in a more pessimistic manner, need to learn from the &lsquo;young-uns&rsquo; that optimism and looking forward, not backward, is a better approach to the future.</p><p> I&rsquo;d like to write more on this topic but I&rsquo;m hooked on this new show that my son turned me on to called &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&rdquo; and I need to watch the next episode. I may not get all of the jokes but what I&rsquo;ve seen has forced me to finally give up that cable station that runs episodes of shows like &ldquo;Bewitched,&rdquo; &ldquo;Green Acres&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sanford and Son.&rdquo;</p><p> Although, my son may not be as culturally savvy as me and unaware of the financial troubles that await him, it seems that he does have many things to teach me.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by <a href=\"http://www.trilincglobal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   TriLinc  </u> </a></p><p> Without solid metrics to quantifiably measure results in social and environmental terms, the whole &ldquo;impact&rdquo; part of &ldquo;impact investing&rdquo; would be worthless. The Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE) is working to build an understanding around impact measurement, and they have collaborated with their members, TriLinc included, to write a report on the &ldquo;State of Measurement: Practice in the SGB Sector,&rdquo; which was released this past month.</p><p> ANDE is a global network of organizations that propel entrepreneurship in emerging markets with a mission to understand the impact of supporting small and growing businesses (SGBs). As a rule of thumb, they aim to create a measurement system to figure out how well companies are doing, and help them to improve.</p><p> Recently, ANDE conducted a survey and follow-up phone interviews with 34 of its members. TriLinc&rsquo;s Marni Hodder and Kathryn Haugen contributed to the survey and participated in a follow-up phone interview. TriLinc helped ANDE gain an understanding of the struggles and triumphs it has endured thus far with impact measurement. Further, Joan Trant and Ms. Haugen joined the network on a Metrics group working call to help make changes and improve upon the rough draft of report.</p><p> As depicted in the report, ANDE found that most impact investors in this market are operating using three key &ldquo;lenses:&rdquo; collecting metrics related to both the scale and depth of impact, tracking economic development indicators such as job creation, and collecting specialized sector metrics to benchmark their portfolios. Then, a majority of firms and funds report these results to their current funders, and often use the results in their discussions with prospective investors.</p><p> However, 40% of ANDE&rsquo;s survey respondents indicated that they believe the largest challenge they face is the lack of stability and resources for their investees concerning their impact measurement. Additionally, social metrics need to &ldquo;balance and align&rdquo; with financial performance indicators. This would place greater emphasis on transparency and attribution, as well as help to develop more efficient and effective ways of data collection and management.</p><p> All in all, there has been tremendous advancements in measurements in the past five years. ANDE has been encouraged by the organizations they surveyed, who have all either implemented some measurement strategy or are in the process of doing so, lending to their early efforts centered around the need for such &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; (Metrics 1.0) and &ldquo;standardization&rdquo; (Metrics 2.0), and are now moving on to &ldquo;value creation&rdquo; (Metrics 3.0). Together, they have proved it is possible to collaboratively create reasonable, sustainable metrics that funds and investors across the globe can utilize.</p>",

    "content": "<p> That&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s nothing your company does that isn&rsquo;t marketing. It&rsquo;s easy to focus on external and internal communications as your most visible marketing vehicles, but whether you realize it or not, everything your company does is marketing. In this  <u>  blog post inspired by the book Rework </u> , the author writes,</p><p> &ldquo;The most successful companies ensure that everyone who comes into contact with your company has a positive experience &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s by talking to someone in the pub or on Twitter, calling your helpline, coming for a job interview, paying an invoice, seeing an ad, visiting your store, or reading a review. This is the new marketing, and it really does include everything.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Really, I mean everything </strong></p><p> Does your company have delivery vehicles? Marketing. Sending an email? Marketing. Got a poster in your break room? Marketing.</p><p> In a hyper-connected world where one action can spread to millions with the click of a mouse, you can make impressions on your customers without ever realizing it. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to be true to who you say you are in everything you do.</p><p> Even if they&rsquo;re not acting in their official capacity, every employee is a representative of your brand. When your employees are engaged and share the company vision, they tell other people about it.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/insights/fans-turn-employees-brand-ambassadors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   In this post  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bottlethecrazy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jennifer Beese  </a> </u>  writes about how to turn your employees into brand ambassadors.</p><p> &ldquo;Your employees represent an untapped resource that holds tremendous potential for your company to scale its marketing efforts.&rdquo;</p><p> Ever spoken to somebody who works for one of those companies that goes above and beyond for their employees? Think back to how that made you feel about that brand.</p><p> On the flip side, ever talked to someone who hates their job at ABC incorporated? I bet you didn&rsquo;t run out and buy their products the next day.</p><p> <strong>  Realistically, you can&rsquo;t manage everything </strong></p><p> Okay, it&rsquo;s impossible to manage every single thing your company does to constantly carry the most appealing marketing message imaginable. But what you can do is ensure that your internal messaging matches what you want your customer to believe. Look at your internal functions as if they were externally visible and ask yourself if you&rsquo;d be proud to put them on display.</p><p> Going back to the break-room example, imagine if your customers had to wait in your employee break room instead of your lobby. How would they feel about their experience? Your employees already feel that way and they&rsquo;re talking about it to their friends.</p><p> Spend the extra time to evaluate the overall impact of the little things you do and you&rsquo;ll find more ways to make an impression than you ever imagined.</p>",

    "link": "top-5-reasons-to-buy-custom-suits",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Every man should have at least one suit in his closet that fits him well.  It&rsquo;s your go to when you have a big meeting or a summer wedding.  It&rsquo;s the item you wear that makes you feel your best.  So if you must own a great fitting suit, why not buy custom?!  When you wear a custom suit you are guaranteed to stand out in a crowd.  Besides the obvious &ndash; a better fit than its &lsquo;off the rack&rsquo; step-brother &ndash; a custom suit will diversify you with its attention to detail.  From selecting your fabric to choosing your button color, you immediately get upgraded from purchasing a suit you&rsquo;re okay with, to designing a suit which is unique to you and 100% your own.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s experience a better fit together by breaking down the top 5 reasons why you should buy custom suits!</p><p> <strong>  Style Your Way </strong></p><p> Have you ever walked into a retail store and tried on a suit but it just didn&rsquo;t live up to all your expectations? Imagine if you could get exactly what you wanted? With custom you truly can have it your way.  You pick the fabric color and pattern: pinstripe or solid?  Number of buttons on your suit jacket: one or two?  Style of lapel: notch or peak?  Jacket pockets: flap or no flap, straight or slanted?  Pants: cuff or no cuff?  You decide! Buying custom allows you to say goodbye to those predetermined suits and puts you in control of your style.</p><p> <strong>  Personalization </strong></p><p> Not only do you control the style, you also get to put your signature stamp on your custom suit.  The customization process lets you personalize the garment and make it your own.  Perhaps you choose a solid navy suit with caramel colored buttons or you decide to match your jacket lining to the lavender pinstripe in your grey suit.  Maybe you want the outside of your suit to remain classic so instead you display your personal touch on the inside of your jacket with a unique message.  Whatever you decide, know the options are limitless when you buy custom.</p><p> <strong>  Quality vs. Price </strong></p><p> Generally speaking the price tag on your custom tailored suit will look like it costs more than an &lsquo;off the rack&rsquo; suit, but remember you can&rsquo;t compare an apple to an orange.  Store bought suits are made from machines and produced for the masses.  These suits typically require additional tailoring after a purchase, which means more money on top of the initial price, not to mention the cost (and time) driving back and forth from the tailor.  On the other hand your custom suit is cared for and crafted by an actual person.  It&rsquo;s constructed with handsome perks such as jacket cuffs with functioning buttons, handpicked stitching, additional fabric on pant heels to prevent wear and tear.  Your custom suit will treat you to these and more with no extra expense or time wasted.</p><p> <strong>  Canvas Make a Difference </strong></p><p> One of the biggest benefits you gain with custom verses &lsquo;off the rack&rsquo; is a canvas lining, the support between the outside layer and inside layer of your jacket.  Machine made suits won&rsquo;t offer this feature because these are fused, meaning glued together, resulting in a stiffer jacket that won&rsquo;t last as long.  A canvas lining adds shape and structure to your jacket.  Over time it will mold to your body giving you a natural supple shape.  It will breathe easier, prevent bubbling in the fabric and keep it from wrinkling.   With a canvased garment your profit will be a longer lasting suit.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MG_2926-copy.jpg\" width=\"1081\"/></p><p> <strong>  Perfect Fit </strong></p><p> What attracts most men to custom tailored suits is the fit.  Ideally your custom suit should feel like second skin.  You achieve this thru finding a good tailor who not only knows how to measure you, but also notes how your body is put together.  Is one arm longer than the other? Are your legs bowed? Do you have muscular thighs?  Your tailor should recognize various traits such as these when you meet with him or her.  Just remember the foundation to obtaining a great fitting suit lies with identifying how you&rsquo;re built along with excellent measurements. </p><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve sensed how a suit should fit, why not buy custom.  Your best fitting suit is the one of a kind piece, the one size and one size only - YOUR SIZE, the fully loaded vestment.  It&rsquo;s your custom suit!</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> This is the season when many people reflect upon the year that soon will be ending.  In this spirit, we have looked back at what we have encouraged you all to be thinking about in 2014.  There have been three major themes we have communicated (or harped on).  They all relate to Santa Claus.</p><p> Santa Claus, we would submit, is no longer a religious figure.  The St. Nick of old has been thoroughly commercialized.  He is the unavoidable presence of the December holiday season.  He rides in at the end of the Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and sticks around until all the unwanted gifts have been returned and exchanged. </p><p> And Santa relates to the three big themes we have been talking about all year.</p><li> Purchase Journeys &ndash; Who is a bigger buyer than Santa?  Nobody comes close.  As we hear it, years ago he changed his business model.  Instead of manufacturing everything at North Pole HQ, he now has a network of preferred providers.  Computerized elves manage this network and recommend toys based on a purchasing algorithm that selects the appropri ate toys based on demographics and other predictive variables.  As soon as one of those toys is purchased or considered, a tailored ad will be pushed your way on Facebook.</li><li> Engagement IQ &ndash; While we have not yet measured Santa Claus in our Engagement IQ research (we will!), we created a system that imputes values based on traditional Santa Claus values &ndash; likability, lunchability, postability.  Our analysis shows that Santa Claus would receive the highest score ever recorded.</li><li> Reputation &ndash; There is a reason why so many marketers use Santa Claus in their ads.  He has a great reputation.  And unlike other corporate spokespeople recently, he has never been recorded knocking out Mrs. Claus in an elevator or taking performance enhancing drugs or having tawdry affairs. <br/>  </li><p> Whether you believe in Santa or not, we wish you the happiest of Holidays and good luck and good fortune in 2015.  May the Holidays bring peace and joy to all &ndash; and forgiveness for our having a little fun at Santa&rsquo;s expense.</p>",

BRANDING &amp; MESSAGING </strong></p><p> Here is the formula for invisibility: LOOK and SOUND just like everybody else. If you&rsquo;re going to go through the work of marketing and announcing your existence to prospects, make sure they don&rsquo;t have a chance to lump you in with everybody else. What does your logo, website, and regular communications etc. say about you? Is your brand consistent enough for clients to &ldquo;get it&rdquo; and be able to clearly explain to others why they should choose you?

SERVING A NICHE </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;ve heard it before: &ldquo;If you try to target everyone, you target no one.&rdquo; Is it possible that you may be ignoring a specific group of people who (a) would love to work with you and (b) would choose you over anybody else? There are profitable niches out there, and it&rsquo;s important to create a plan for identifying, reaching, and serving them.</p><p> Suggested Articles:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://platinumstrategies.com/2014/03/25/advisors-can-learn-warren-buffets-annual-letter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What Advisors Can Learn From Warren Buffet&rsquo;s Annual Letter  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://platinumstrategies.com/2014/06/27/50-things-learned-platinum-elite-advisors-forum/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   50 Things I learned At the Platinum Elite Advisors Forum  </a> </u> <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3.

Think about all of the potential interactions you have: Reviews over the phone, first appointments, clients reviews etc. What you say and do matters. Why leave any of that to chance?

Top-performing advisors stay in front of their clients year round. There are many different ways to communicate (e.g. mail, email, social media, phone) and your clients will have their preferences. Make sure you accommodate and plan for how you will communicate.

    "content": "<p> Written by: Jacob Leise | <u>  <a href=\"http://emoneyadvisor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eMoney Advisor  </a> </u></p><p> As a financial advisor, there is pressure to market to generations that are &ldquo;poised&rdquo; to be the next driver in the industry. There&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101751416\" target=\"_blank\">  this article </a> , for example, that says the Millennials and Gen Xers will inherit a huge transfer of wealth in the coming years so we need to appeal to a younger crowd. Then there&rsquo;s this one, that claims Baby Boomers are going to live longer and spend more, so we have to market to them using more conventional methods. And many more like them.</p><p> The point is, this marketing philosophy&mdash;known as generational marketing&mdash;is a popular option for many advisors because it helps them focus their efforts and hit their target markets with little additional research. But for every nine proponents of this practice, there is one detractor arguing loudly against it. Why? Because not everyone fits neatly into a broadly defined category. When considering if it&rsquo;s the right approach for your business, it&rsquo;s important to realize that generational marketing has a great deal of value, but it&rsquo;s not the always best to cast the widest-net, in every circumstance. Here&rsquo;s why the critics agree.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s in a Generation&hellip; </strong></p><p> There are a great deal of  <a href=\"/category/sell/digital-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  studies </a> ,  <a href=\"http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/35038.asp#multiview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  articles </a> , and other sources arguing that marketing to someone based solely on their age range is a foolish enterprise, and they often point to the actual generational classifications themselves as one of its main problems. Whether it&rsquo;s Gen X, Baby Boomers, Millennials, or some other new term a marketer is trying to coin at this very moment, a generation is just an arbitrary span of birth dates that seem to go together. And often times the words used to describe generations feel like they belong in a Zodiac rather than a marketing plan. Millennials are self-centered (but then again so is Pisces under a full moon), Baby-boomers appreciate a hard worker (I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone appreciates a hard worker), and Gen Xers are experts at getting things done (just kidding &hellip; I took that one from a fortune cookie). So the big question remains:</p><p> <strong>  Should You Implement A Generational Marketing Strategy in Your Business? </strong></p><p> And the answer is yes you should, for the most part. While some of the arguments against generational marketing are valid, generational marketing is an effective way to target people with shared interests, needs, and values, especially when you have little to no additional information about them. Though it requires that we as marketers make broad assumptions about people (see&mdash;I&rsquo;m making a broad assumption that you recognize yourself as a marketer, in addition to an advisor, because you&rsquo;re still reading this post), more often than not these assumptions are accurate, or close to accurate, if only because they&rsquo;re so broad.</p><p> For example, many baby boomers are just about ready (or think they are ready) for retirement and yes, most of them actually are less technologically literate than younger generations. If you meet a Millennial, it&rsquo;s quite safe to assume they did grow up with technology and that at some point in the near future, they may be interested in buying their first home or getting married. Obviously, these things aren&rsquo;t true of every member of the generation, but it is true of a large majority of them, and for that reason, it makes a generational approach to identifying your target market, as good as any other common marketing philosophy also based on demographics.</p><p> <strong>  How to Use Generational Marketing Effectively in Your Business </strong></p><p> Generational marketing can be used to tailor your marketing campaign or sales pitch and is even useful when profiling prospects, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a crutch for every gap in your target market and it shouldn&rsquo;t be the only aspect of your marketing plan. Speak to any person of any generation for any length of time and you&rsquo;ll quickly find they are much more than the sum of the shared experiences of their peers because, no matter their age, people are unique.</p><p> As you get to know prospects better and hopefully begin to transition them into clients, you can abandon your initial generational assumptions about them in favor of more personal details. But until you get to know a person or group of people on an individual basis, assuming things about them based on their generation can help bridge the gap between total strangers and trusted clients.</p>",

There are too many events where attendees are stuffed in chairs, lined up in rows, and forced to listen to speakers talk for hours on end.  Doesn&rsquo;t everyone realize that attendees stop paying attention after the first 10 minutes? If they do, then why-oh-WHY do our colleagues continue to tie attendees to chairs in rows for 4-6 hours per day?</p><p> (Ok. That might be a slight exaggeration. According to Andrea Sullivan, president of BrainStrength Systems, a company that provides  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.meetingsfocus.com/ArticleDetails/tabid/162/ArticleID/15393/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   corporate training and learning services  </a> </u>  using scientific research, &ldquo;People can listen only so long at a time&hellip;After they&rsquo;ve listened to a speaker/presenter for even 15 or 20 minutes, they need to make a shift to some kind of active participation&hellip;&rdquo;)</p><p> The point is, sitting for hours on end is stupid and it needs to stop!</p><p> Last month, we helped an association merge their networking reception and general session for 3,000 people into a single event. We developed 10 different interactive experiences that were designed to influence networking, create conversations and connect people to content.  We turned attendees into active participants and helped them create a networking and social media buzz.</p><p> A few weeks earlier, we helped another association execute their first  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.interactivemeetingtechnology.com/#whatwedo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hybrid event  </a> </u>  and create conversations.</p><p> Every day, we help event organizers take the bold step of moving away from a world of attendees sitting in chairs in neatly organized rows toward a world where event attendees are active contributors.  We have worked with national sales meetings, all employee meeting, customer events, galas, road shows,  <u>  trade show booths </u> , expos and many other types of events.</p><p> Today, I want to share our proven formula with you so you too can join our army of people trying to change the world of meetings and events. Please take notes and share these tips with your colleagues. You can save us all.</p><p> How do we take an ordinary event from Snoozeville to engaging?</p><p> <strong>  Step 1: Identify Goals and Objectives </strong></p><p> We start by looking at the goals and objectives of the event. It is important to understand our client&rsquo;s audience and ultimately what they want them to do or take away from the event.</p><p> How often do you ask yourself those questions when planning your events? It sounds simple, but if this crucial first step is missed, all other efforts are futile.</p><p> <strong>  Step #2: Segment the Audience </strong></p><p> When preparing for an event, it&rsquo;s important to know who is expected to attend as well as future attendees who are not attending or are disengaged from the event. Once that is complete, we look at the audience by behavioral type.</p><p> This step involves doing some secondary research about trends and challenges. Sometimes we have to get other people involved to learn more about the attendee. Useful information includes your audience&rsquo;s demographic makeup, learning needs, challenges and job tasks.</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: Identify Constraints &amp; Resources </strong></p><p> Some clients have lots of volunteers and no budget. Some have budgets but no people. Some clients have a CEO that needs to speak for 90 minutes. Some have agendas that are &ldquo;filled up and unchangeable.&rdquo; Some have spaces that have challenges or vendors or technologies that we have to work with.</p><p> At the same time, we look at the resources. Did someone donate 47 monitors? Do you have as much carpet as you want? Is one of the sponsors a large format printer?</p><p> <strong>  Step 4: Brainstorm Boogie </strong></p><p> Finally, we get ready to brainstorm.  Our goal here is to come up with simple, fun and smart engagement solutions that match attendees&rsquo; needs and behavior style.  Also, we look for ways to pull together a theme that can be carried throughout the entire event.</p><p> In this process, we use a set of &ldquo;engagement cards&rdquo; that we helped MPI create for their  <u>  meeting design curriculum </u> .  There are about 50 cards that are extremely useful in getting everyone to contribute new ideas for their meetings and events.  We recommend allocating 2-4 hours for this step. The output of the step is several different ideas for solutions that hopefully map out to satisfy all of the attendee needs.</p><p> <strong>  Step 5: Piece Together the Event Concept. Challenge Assumptions. </strong></p><p> In this step, we pull together the event concept, challenge our assumptions and validate budgets.  It&rsquo;s important that we make sure that our recommendations align with objectives, attendee segmentation and behavioral segmentation. IF YOU DON&rsquo;T DO THIS THE PLAN WILL FAIL. (Yes, I shouted that!)</p><p> <strong>  When you are compiling your recommendations, here are some important things to note: </strong></p><li> Incorporate notes about light, space, sound, digital and structure.  These things matter. For example, if you set the room with chairs in rows &mdash; then you are likely not creating space for conversations. In many respects, you literally &ldquo;set the stage&rdquo; for the type of engagement your event encourages.</li><li> Recognize that not 100% of the attendees will do or be interested in everything that you are recommending.  Please be sure to recognize that and scale appropriately.  (For example, you might not need 1,000 buttons if only 100 people are going to collect buttons.)</li><li> For what it&rsquo;s worth, budgeting can be tricky here, because you are probably coming up with new to the world ideas.  How do you figure out how much a laser maze is going to cost?  Or, where do you get a custom art piece built? Who can make these concepts a reality?</li><li> Do you need the 5 star version of everything or will the 2 star version be sufficient?  (Expect future posts on this, as I have plenty to say on the topic.)</li><li> Technology is not the answer.  Ever.  Always start with people and process, then get to technology.</li><p> Note: For the budget conscious, we  <a href=\"http://www.socialpointforevents.com/#solutions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  packaged our most popular games, interactive touch screens and social media executions into turnkey solutions under our SocialPoint&reg; digital solutions brand </a> . They plug into your event seamlessly and are budget friendly.</p><p> <strong>  Step 6: Propose Solutions to Your Stakeholders </strong></p><p> In this step, we find it much easier to get senior leaders to sign off on the concepts.  This works well when you remind them of the objectives and review how the concepts tie to their vision.</p><p> However, the individuals that are part of the execution on the stakeholder side are usually much more resistant&hellip;because you are asking them to change what they do.  It might be undefined, feel squishy and they might be just plain scared of change.</p><p> We get these individuals on board by scheduling smaller meetings with them to review the concept and get their alternative input.  In some cases, they approve the concepts-as-is.  In some cases, they have lots of creative ideas to make it better based on initiatives that they are doing that nobody on the core team knew about.</p><p> <strong>  Step 7: Pre-production Phase </strong></p><p> Sun-Tzu wrote that the battle is often won before you take the field.  In my opinion, the same thing is true when you are turning attendees into participants.  By completing the steps above you have already laid out your strategy and won the battle.</p><p> So, your goal in this phase is to make sure that nobody unwittingly sends you off course.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how it can happen.  You will have experienced people doing new things that they might not be good at, or totally understand.  Be sure to allocate extra time in your schedule and keep everyone reminded of your goals and objectives.  IF YOU DO NOT YOU MIGHT FAIL.</p><p> Also, beware of executives or other stakeholders that want to make late changes.  Usually a late addition means removing something and adding something the executive thinks is cool&hellip;like a chocolate fountain.</p><p> <strong>  Step 8: Onsite Execution </strong></p><p> Execution onsite should be similar to what you have seen in the past. Remember to double check that the pieces are coming together as you designed. Allow for extra time during your loading. When you are trying something new like this &ndash; be wary of the details &ndash; if your room for error is small, details matter.</p><p> <strong>  Step 9: Measurement &amp; Follow-up </strong></p><p> We like to do follow-up surveys based on the goals and objectives of the event rather than the logistics.  For example, if our goal was to improve networking &ndash; how will we know if we achieved that goal? Setting specific metrics for measurement beforehand is key to evaluating the effectiveness of an event.</p><p> One smart person we met likes to ask the following questions: &ldquo;Did you meet anyone new at this meeting? Yes or NO? If Yes, who was it and how will you do business together?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Bottom Line </strong></p><p> You can save us all from perpetuating the cycle of stuffing people in chairs for hours on end at meetings and events. I need your help!</p><p> The steps above outline our formula for turning passive event attendees into active participants.  Of course, there are more details and some secret sauce that we left out. You should be able to get pretty far by following these steps.</p><p> Please do me a favor &ndash; give this process a try at your next event and share it with your customers and colleagues.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.interactivemeetingtechnology.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Call me  </a> </u>  if you need guidance.</p><p> Good Luck! We are counting on you!</p>",

    "title": "How to Defeat the Robo Advisor",
    "link": "how-to-defeat-the-robo-advisor",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The industry buzz of the last couple years about concerns over the implications of automated investment advice, &ldquo;Robo-advisors,&rdquo; culminated this week in a session at the  <u>  <a href=\"https://summit.marketcounsel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Market Counsel Summit  </a> </u>  called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.belayadvisor.com/revenge-nerds-duran-michel-weissbluth-stein-robo-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Revenge of the Nerds  </a> </u> . Four industry heavyweights &ndash; Duran, Michel, Weissbluth, and Stein &ndash; discussed the straightforward question &ldquo;is the Robo our ally or our enemy?&rdquo; A majority of the audience indicated that they believe the Robos to be a threat to the advisor client relationship. Is it?I am not in the camp that worries that financial advisors will be out of business as a result of the rise of Robo-advisors. If the Robo&rsquo;s were going to take over the financial advice business, wouldn&rsquo;t  <u>  <a href=\"http://corp.financialengines.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial Engines  </a> </u> , the granddaddy of the Robo&rsquo;s, have already done that? Granted, it has $100 billion under management. But even in the retirement plan space where they play that is not an enormous market share. And if their prospects for taking over the world were that bright, their stock would not likely be down 50% since the middle of 2013.Some advisors do have something to fear of Robo-advisors. Advisors who offer only investment advice without offering financial planning or  <a href=\"/category/learn/robotics-and-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  customized niche services </a>  are the ones most likely to be replaced by the machines. Offering periodically rebalanced models of mutual funds is better done by technology. If that&rsquo;s all you do, you can be worried. In fact, if you are offering some version of that service in your practice and you are not utilizing a robo-esque service like <a href=\"http://www.tamaracinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Tamarac </a>  or  <a href=\"http://www.irebal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  iRebal </a> , your practice is a lot less efficient than it could be.Even with straightforward asset allocation based investment management, humans have an advantage over software. As Joe Duran points out in his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20141204/BLOG16/141209951/clash-of-the-titans-bionic-advisers-vs-robo-advisers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   column last week in Investment News  </a> </u> , human advisors have judgment and empathy, which clients really need when the situation is complex and the stakes are high. He relates the common story of many advisors who helped guide clients not to follow their worst instincts when it was difficult for them to stay the course through difficult markets. Betterment&rsquo;s founder Jon Stein claims the service has gone through several downturns without client net withdrawals but that&rsquo;s not true. The service was not available to the public until 2010 &ndash; over a year after the bottom of the last bear market. I find it unlikely that automated services will be able to retain many clients who panic when the markets get ugly for months, quarters, or even years at a time. It&rsquo;s not like they could be like the investment advisor version of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t take you to all cash, Dave.&rdquo;But if you are offering financial advice (as opposed to simply investment advice) your relationships are not threatened by the robots. As Michael Kitces has  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/why-robo-advisors-will-be-no-threat-to-real-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pointed out  </a> </u>  several times, it still takes humans to provide the complicated and complex kind of advice that integrates investment management and goalsetting with risk management, tax planning, college funding and financial aid issues, health and long-term care decisions, and estate planning. Beyond the sheer complexity of the issues, there is the conundrum of getting the right data in the first place to be able to formulate the proper advice. In my experience and observation, the initial client interview is as much art as science.The most successful advisors, in addition to providing real financial planning advice and having some level of  <u>  specialization at something </u> , will leverage the technology behind the Robo advisor to enhance their own offerings. In the Nerds session, Duran made the point by saying eventually all successful advisors will be &ldquo;a shade of bionic&rdquo; utilizing a new term that has gotten more traction than Kitces&rsquo; use of &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/the-advisor-of-the-future-is-not-human-nor-robot-but-cyborg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cyborg advisors  </a> </u> &rdquo; to describe the same idea last year.In fact, there is good reason to believe that bionic advisors will not only be the most efficient practitioners but may provide the best advice. In his wonderful new book about the history of the computer  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution-ebook/dp/B00JGAS65Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Innovators  </a> </u> , Walter Isaacson suggests that &ldquo;the future might belong to the people who can best partner and collaborate with computers.&rdquo; He describes a chess tournament organized in 2005 in which players could work in teams along with computers of their choice. In the end, it was neither one of the many grandmasters the tournament attracted nor the team with the most powerful computer that won but rather &ldquo;two American amateurs who used three computers at the same time and knew how to manage the process of collaborating with their machines. &lsquo;Their skill at manipulating and coaching their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants ,&rsquo; according to Kasparov. <a href=\"/category/grow/human-performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   1  </u>  ] </a> &rdquo; Symbiosis won. Sounds like a strategy that could yield the best financial advice.Real financial advisors need not fear competition from the robo-advisor. Recruit them onto your team. Be expert at leveraging the computer&rsquo;s unique ability to store and manipulate massive databases of information and add your unique ability to strategize and you will be the advisor of the future.</p>",

    "content": "This blog originally appeared on DNN's blog page.I see dead people. No, I see zombies. They walk aimlessly down the street and swerve into my lane on the highway. They&rsquo;re not under the spell of a witch or voodoo overlord; they&rsquo;re controlled by their smartphones.<strong> I See Zombies Everywhere</strong>Zombies have taken over planet Earth. As I walk past a gym, zombies (in workout clothes) exit. Arm extended, phone in palm, shoulders hunched forward. Forget about making eye contact. These zombies are focused on the latest text, tweet or email. They can&rsquo;t be bothered by humans.When a car swerves briefly into my lane, or when a driver is going 35 MPH in a 70 MPH zone, it&rsquo;s invariably driven by a zombie: one hand on the wheel, the other holding a phone.Eyes pointed straight down. Talented zombies use two phones, while steering the car with the backs of their hands.Visit a restaurant these days and you&rsquo;ll see zombies seated at the bar, eating a meal by themselves. Fork in one hand, phone in the other. It&rsquo;s difficult to tell which they enjoy more (food or phone). Forget about talking to the bartender or to other patrons. The phone rules.Oh, and have you seen the deranged zombies? Their Bluetooth earpiece is neatly hidden. As you approach them, they&rsquo;re talking really loud. It&rsquo;s just the two of you on the street, so you say, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; The zombie pays you no attention, walks on by and continues his conversation.<strong> Technology and The Human Condition</strong>Call me an old timer, but I&rsquo;m concerned about technology&rsquo;s impact on the human condition. I remember the B.C. era (&ldquo;Before Cellphone&rdquo;). We made eye contact, we made conversation. We talked to strangers. We talked to friends.Today? We make more eye contact with our phone&rsquo;s camera lens (selfies!), while human-to-human conversation is at historic lows. We&rsquo;re so concerned about the email that arrived two minutes ago that we may not see the car that&rsquo;s swerving onto the sidewalk.Let&rsquo;s consider how we got here.<strong> Why We&rsquo;re Victims of Technology</strong><strong> Hyperconnectedness</strong>It all started with the BlackBerry. Early generations of the device looked like extra-large pagers.But these pagers were electronic handcuffs. Now, your inbox followed you wherever you went.To the gym, to the beach or to sleep, the BlackBerry would buzz on each new email.And the world would never be the same.Now, you could email the VP Sales for a pricing request and she&rsquo;d reply one minute later. You could invite a friend for dinner and know that he&rsquo;d reply in an hour or less. You could lie on the beach for the afternoon, but still keep tabs on your inbox.<strong> It&rsquo;s Our Primary Channel of Communication</strong>The phone was a fabulous piece of technology. We could speak to one another across large distances. Today, smartphone users under 20 may not know about the &ldquo;phone&rdquo; in their smartphone. Adults have followed suit.Related Post: <u> <a href=\"http://allvirtual.me/2013/02/04/my-bff-and-i-agree-10-reasons-texting-has-taken-over-the-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  10 Reasons Texting Has Taken Over the World </a></u>We speak to each other far less than before. Instead, we text, email and chat. For important life moments, we no longer call family members. Instead, we&rsquo;ll post to Instagram or Facebook and let them learn about it there.<strong> FOMO becomes FOMU</strong>Our &ldquo;fear of missing out&rdquo; has become a &ldquo;fear of missing (the most recent) update.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m guilty of this for sure: I&rsquo;m quick to check for the latest email and the most recent Twitter mention or Facebook Like.Technology has created this constant anxiety of &ldquo;staying on top of things,&rdquo; as if there&rsquo;s value in seeing an email minutes after it arrives. That&rsquo;s why some people sleep with their phone by their side, and invite it to buzz on each new message. When you disrupt sleep, you disrupt the human condition.<strong> Why I&rsquo;m Concerned</strong><strong> Health and Safety</strong>Scientists have studied links between cell phone use and cancer risk (see this <u> <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones\" target=\"_blank\">  fact sheet </a></u> from the National Cancer Institute and this <u> <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1qSd8KQFTeQJ:www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/05/31/who.cell.phones/index.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CNN article </a></u> about a World Health Organization study). My gut tells me that prolonged use of cell phones can have harmful, long term effects on the body.There are more direct hazards, too. One afternoon, I left my office to grab lunch. I was checking email as I walked to my car. Because I wasn&rsquo;t fully aware of my surrounding environment, I nearly walked into an oncoming car.A <u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2013/08/02/texting-nearly-as-dangerous-while-walking-than-driving/\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes article </a></u> notes that &ldquo;texting distractions may have been a contributing factor in the 4,280 pedestrian traffic fatalities recorded during 2010,&rdquo; according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.<strong> Technology Will Continue to Develop and Evolve</strong>Consider Google Glass.On the one hand, technology gets more seamlessly integrated (e.g. check email via Glass).On the other hand, it makes it even easier to disengage from more meaningful human connection (e.g. check email on Glass while your friend is trying to talk to you).When they visit my house, I say hi to the friendly delivery staff from FedEx, UPS and the US Postal Service. Those conversations will take a different form when those deliveries are performed by drones.I&rsquo;m concerned about the evolution of the human species. With continued advances in technology, will we lose the ability to talk to one another?<strong> What We Can Do About It</strong><strong> Let the Phone Wait</strong>I used to have a rule where I&rsquo;d come home from work and put away the phone. It would sit in a drawer until after dinner&rsquo;s been eaten and the dishes washed. Later that evening, I&rsquo;d open the phone to check for calls, texts and emails. Sadly, that rule fell by the wayside.But I ought to return to it.We need to seize control back from the phones who rule us. Aside from emergencies, let the phone wait! The email you received a minute ago can wait an hour. Heck, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world if you reply to that email tomorrow.The key is to condition yourself. Maybe you need a habit like mine (though I hope you do a better job sticking to it). We&rsquo;ll live healthier lives if we arrange for periods where we &ldquo;make the phone wait.&rdquo;Alternatively, you could go to a summer camp like the one described in <u> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/fashion/a-trip-to-camp-to-break-a-tech-addiction.html\" target=\"_blank\">  this New York Times article </a></u>.<strong> Go Out and Meet New People</strong>Technology has a way of hardening our shell or keeping us within a bubble.When you&rsquo;re immersed in your email, checking your Twitter stream or responding to a text, you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;available&rdquo; to those around you.Technology makes it too easy to be in a room full of people, but really be alone to ourselves. So make it a point to meet five new people each week. Beyond getting their names, get to know their stories, their interests and their passions.If you&rsquo;ve developed online relationships (e.g. via Twitter), arrange to meet in person. The human connection is unique and special.<strong> Learn to Enjoy and Appreciate Your Surroundings</strong>In the Bay Area, my average weather day is 70 degrees and sun. Depending on where I am, I can get views of the Bay, giant Sequoia trees or the Golden Gate Bridge. But I can be blind to it all if my face is planted in my phone.When we immerse ourselves in technology, it makes us take things for granted. We must find occasions to leave the world of our inbox and explore the larger world around us. This is a behavior that must be learned and reinforced.Now when I grab lunch at work, I&rsquo;ll leave the phone in my pocket and enjoy the afternoon weather. But I can feel the phone calling out to me and I&rsquo;ll sometimes suffer a relapse. I&rsquo;ll pull out the phone and check email. Meanwhile, another car is pulling out of its parking spot.<strong> Share Your Thoughts</strong>What do you think? Are you comfortable with where technology is heading? Are you concerned about the future of human-to-human connection and interaction?Let&rsquo;s continue the conversation below. And if I ever bump into you on the street, please call me out if my face is stuck in my phone. I may have been zombie-fied!",

    "content": "<p> Wriiten by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediatoday.com/users/lauren-riley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lauren Riley  </a> </u>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/BubbleJobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @BubbleJobs  </a> </u> As the year draws to a close, I thought now would be a good time to look at what the next twelve months hold for social media marketing.With anything in the digital industry, social media is developing at a rapid rate, so it&rsquo;s worth taking a look at what direction it will be taking in 2015.If you&rsquo;re also interested in the SEO/content side of things, Amy will be sharing her Top 7 SEO and Content Predictions For 2015 tomorrow! <strong>  1) Much More Video Content </strong> While video has been a popular social media marketing option for a while, I think it&rsquo;ll gain a lot more traction in 2015.With the rise of young video bloggers (or vloggers) such as Zoella, Tanya Burr and Alfie Deyes ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/24726895\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   they have millions of YouTube subscribers each and have signed beauty and book deals worth thousands of pounds  </a> </u> ), it won&rsquo;t be surprising to see brands jumping on the video bandwagon, with some of the larger companies vying for the chance to have one of the famous vloggers front their campaigns. <strong>  2) Goodbye Google+? </strong> 2015 might be the time that Google says au revoir to its own social network for good.As Vic Gundotra &ndash; Google&rsquo;s Senior Vice President of Social and the &ldquo;father of Google+&rdquo; &ndash; announced he was  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10786358/Google-chief-Vic-Gundotra-leaving-company.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   leaving the company  </a> </u>  back in April, and Google  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2014/08/29/google-authorship-killed-google-plus-next/\" target=\"_blank\">   killed Authorship  </a> </u>  back in August, so it seems that they&rsquo;re phasing out the platform.A lot of people spent time building their Google+ profiles in hopes that their content would appear higher in search results, but now that Authorship&rsquo;s been scrapped, it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to see people migrating away from the network, and Google ultimately closing the project. <strong>  3) Even More Paid Social </strong> Anyone who manages a company&rsquo;s social media presence will know that Facebook has been dramatically decreasing organic page reach in a bid to promote their paid advertising offerings, and that unless you&rsquo;re a huge brand with a significant following, the only way to reach all of your fans is to stump up the cash.Couple this with Pinterest  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/pinterest-expands-self-serve-promoted-pins-to-more-businesses/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rolling out its Promoted Pins feature  </a> </u>  to more businesses in August, and Twitter expanding their advertising offerings to include  <u>  <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/twitter-mobile-carrier-targeting-111340\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more specific mobile targeting  </a> </u> , businesses will more than likely boost their social media advertising efforts, as well as explore the possibility of hiring paid social media experts (we covered this in our digital job trends blog  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/top-5-digital-job-trends-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> ). <strong>  4) Mobile </strong> It seems an obvious prediction to make, but there are lots of reasons to suggest that 2015 will see an even more dramatic increase in focus on mobile-first in terms of social media marketing and advertising.With Twitter developing its advertising platform and giving businesses the chance to  <u>  <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/twitter-mobile-carrier-targeting-111340\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   target users by mobile network  </a> </u>  and users with new mobile devices, as well as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-buys-tap-commerce-in-mobile-advertising-push/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   buying mobile ad firm Tap Commerce  </a> </u>  back in July, it&rsquo;s clear that social is leaning heavily towards mobile.With this in mind, it won&rsquo;t be surprising to see teams in larger companies purely focused on mobile social media advertising. <strong>  5) Bigger Use of Data/Analytics </strong> Several social media platforms have really upped their game when it comes to analytics and data on offer in 2014, so I would expect to see even smaller companies making more use of the information on offer to them in 2015.This comes after Pinterest  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pinterest-promoted-pins-new-analytics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   released its revamped, incredibly detailed analytics dashboard  </a> </u>  in June, and Twitter announced that they&rsquo;re  <u>  experimenting with inbuilt analytics </u>  within tweets last month, so it&rsquo;s clear that social media platforms are keen to share their data with their customers, and this will have a knock-on effect on businesses who will use this information for more intelligent social media marketing.So there we go, some predictions on social media marketing in 2015. Do you think these will happen in the next 12 months, or do you have any predictions of your own?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  What You Need to Know </strong></p><p> According to the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), 44% of regulatory exams conducted in 2013 resulted in deficiencies related to the firm&rsquo;s contracts or advisory agreements. <br/> <br/> The most common contract deficiency was not in the content of the contracts, but instead the faulty execution of them. In cases where the actual content of the contracts were deficient, the most common issues were:</p><li> Fees and fee calculation methods not being correctly identified</li><li> Inaccurate or out-dated terms within the agreement</li><li> Use of &ldquo;hedge clauses&rdquo; that inappropriately limited the advisor&rsquo;s role or responsibilities <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Why You Should Care </strong></p><p> Apart from regulatory issues, inaccurate advisory agreements have the potential to negatively impact your firm or your relationship with your clients by increasing business risk, creating the potential for personal liability and creating confusion among clients. <br/> <br/> Improperly executed contracts create both regulatory and legal risk, and in some cases financial risk. Documenting and adhering to the fee terms and calculation methods in your advisory agreements will ensure that you are getting paid the correct amount by your clients. Performing a review of your existing agreements gives you a chance to find discrepancies before a regulator does. <br/> <br/> Maintaining an updated version of all contract templates (both current and prior versions) serves as an effective control so that your firm is always using the most recent version with new clients.</p><p> <strong>  Our Recommendations </strong></p><p> To ensure that your firm is keeping up with regulatory requirements and industry best practices in this area:</p><li> Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; language from another firm&rsquo;s advisory agreement. Your agreements must be both internally consistent and in alignment with the language and declarations in your ADV (including the fee calculation methods used).</li><li> Avoid hedge language that conflicts with or absolves you from your duties as a fiduciary</li><li> Use a separate agreement for ongoing advisory services (both discretionary and nondiscretionary) as well as &ldquo;project-based&rdquo; services, like financial planning. Your duties differ with each and this should be clear in your agreements.</li><li> Maintain one set of agreements as &ldquo;production versions&rdquo; to ensure that the most up-to-date contracts include the current terms.</li><li> Store retired versions in your books and records files and take steps to ensure that IARs are pulling from the production version.</li><li> Ensure that you track the delivery and receipt of advisory agreements and maintain a signed agreement for each client. Test the completeness of these files periodically.</li>",

    "link": "5-smart-goals-for-financial-advisors-in-2015",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Clarity creates confidence. If you really dive in and practice what you preach, you can make 2015 your best year yet. In order to do that, you need to have a clear picture of your goals, your desired results, and an action plan. Then, you must follow through.</p><p> <strong>  Here are 5 smart goals for financial advisors in 2015: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1.  Clarify Your Vision:  </strong> <br/> Be visionary. Share your vision with everyone in your circle. This includes your team, your strategic alliances, your clients, and your prospective clients. This is a powerful group of people who can serve as advocates for your firm. Deliberately share your vision with them so they can learn, understand, and pass your message on to others.</p><p> <strong>  2.  Be an Entrepreneur 1st and a Financial Advisor 2nd: </strong>   <br/> Nothing great is every accomplished alone. To make a big impact you need the right people on your team. Evaluate your partners for success, both internally and externally. Focus on your team members, coaching partners, and your strategic alliances &ndash; CPA&rsquo;s, attorneys, and life-insurance partners. Ensure that each key player understands your vision &ndash; (goal #1), and that they are positioned to help you grow your net income and increase your equity value.</p><p> <strong>  3.  Help Clients Remove Emotion:  </strong> <br/> The one constant denominator in life is change. There will always be peaks and valleys and highs and lows.  How many times have you been asked to look into your crystal ball? Provide top-notch communication to your clients in order to help them remove emotion, prepare for the ups and down, and reassure them through the rough spots ahead.</p><p> <strong>  4.  Be Client Centric:  </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s easy for firms to think they are client centric. A recent article,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/news/practice_management/glenn-g-kautt-youre-not-client-centric-2690291-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Reality Check: You&rsquo;re Not So Client Centric  </a> </u> , by Glenn G. Kautt says; &ldquo;Recent research suggests true client centricity is not part of a mission statement, nor is it a higher level of service &ndash; nor a heightened sensitivity to client needs.&rdquo; Kautt goes on to say that Wharton professor Peter Fader defines client centricity as a focused business strategy that aligns a company&rsquo;s products and services with the needs of its most valuable customers.</p><p> <strong>  5.  Be Passionate:  </strong> <br/> Let your passion be seen! Clients have a choice in who they choose as their financial advisor. Help them choose you. You need to tell your story, with conviction; &ldquo;this is why I do what I do, and this is why I love it!&rdquo; Sharing your personal story is more than your 10-second elevator speech; it&rsquo;s an opportunity for clients and prospective clients to develop a deeper relationship with you.</p><p> These five goals will help you focus on creating a culture that nurtures and improves quality of life, not only for yourself, but for your team members and your clients as well.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnGDryden\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dryden  </a>   Media Group </u></p><p> Security is always a game of measure vs. countermeasure and malvertising is no exception. Now that smart attackers have discovered how to twist the nature of the online advertising to their criminal ends, awareness and a number of responses are necessary to counter the threat.</p><p> Malvertising will thrive as long as it is worth attackers&rsquo; money, meaning the Web&rsquo;s large population of unaware or otherwise susceptible victims will remain at risk. The complexity of the threat means there is no single solution, but important steps can be taken across the board.</p><p> First, the ad networks need to do a better job of policing content they display. When even the largest and well-resourced ad networks, like Google&rsquo;s, are found to be aiding attackers, it should sound a call-to-action for the entire industry. Online advertising underpins a huge slice of the Web economy, so it is obviously against many diverse stakeholders&rsquo; interests for the public to increasingly associating online ads with malware and abuse.</p><p> Secondly, the reputable, high-traffic sites regrettably implicated in malware attacks &ndash; because of ad content on their pages that they fundamentally cannot control &ndash; will likely press for better content screening at the ad networks&rsquo; side. It is conceivable they will even vote with their wallets and prefer to do business with demonstrably more secure ad partners.</p><p> Third, individuals and organizations need to keep focusing on awareness of the problem and can turn to a few safeguards, regardless of whether the security of ad networks improves. There are browser settings and plug-ins like AdBlock, for example, which block the dynamic scripts and quiet connections ads use to display dangerous content. However, these changes have the side effect of also disabling useful features and interfaces on popular sites as well, making them not worth the effort for some users.</p><p> In recent research, many traditional PC defenses like anti-virus and other endpoint protection software cannot reliably stop malvertising attacks. This is because these tools frequently cannot determine in time whether a Flash-powered banner ad, for example (which is not defined as malicious, itself), is simply serving ad content or something more sinister.</p><p> When you consider malvertising-linked outrage, financial losses and device restoration/clean-up costs, you have to agree that the Web&rsquo;s malicious actors have &ndash; unsurprisingly, yet again &ndash; proven adept at turning e-commerce&rsquo;s latest features to their own, criminal ends. Attackers are banking on the reality that we cannot block every ad or hold every ad network to any kind of uniform security screening.</p><p> It is therefore even more urgent for influential ad industry figures to step-up in response and for CIOs and CISOs to recognize and account for malvertising in the array of threats facing their devices and employees. Without focused action to curtail malvertising, we may soon long for the days when ads only planted songs in our heads instead of malware in our devices.</p><p> Rahul Kashyap is Chief Security Architect and Head of Research at Bromium.</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "Brand is all about what people see when they look at a product or service.  What is your brand?  What do they see when they look at you? Brand identity is a mental or emotional association in the consumer&rsquo;s mind.  It is initiated by the images used in advertising and by the words used to describe a product or service.  Marketers and advertisers know that by repeating these images and messages, the consumer remembers these associations.  Thus, a brand is born. For the wealth management professional this phenomenon creates both a risk and an opportunity.  The risk is that if the message is not managed properly, people may form an incorrect perception of you.  This could result in limited or even lost opportunities.  But for those professionals who carefully plan and proactively manage their branding messages, they can create a brand image for themselves that will help them create more opportunities for business with new and existing clients.   Anyone who has client-facing responsibility in a wealth management firm needs a story to tell about what they do.  This message should simply and concisely communicate how they serve the holistic wealth management needs of their clients. In short, they need a Personal Branding Message.   <strong> The Personal Branding Message</strong>is a series of authentic, flexible points that you can use in part or together with the intention of setting expectations for the type of comprehensive relationship you would like to have with the client.  Sharing this Personal Branding Message is the first step in shaping, or in some cases transforming, the attitudes and opinions of clients, prospects and potential referrers.   Articulating your Personal Branding Message is really about creating awareness.  It is a catalyst to engagement.  The Personal Branding Message in this context can help to create a readiness for the client or prospect to engage with you in a broader wealth conversation.  The desired client outcome from this conversation should be that the client or prospect says to herself, \"I understand that you have something valuable that could benefit me.  Therefore, I am willing to share my time and my information with to see just how I might benefit.\"   <strong> Your Personal Branding Message must align with your firm's value proposition.</strong> It is really your own script of how you serve your clients in order to deliver on the promise made in the value proposition. It is important to note that the scripts and phrases you frame-up for your Personal Branding Message are a starting point.  Each individual you engage is unique and each situation is unique; thus you will vary your Personal Branding Message slightly for each situation.  But, when you have your Personal Branding Message down pat, you have a tool box of well-thought-out themes and phrases that you can use individually or in combination to set the proper expectations with anyone. How you describe yourself will have a lasting impact throughout the entire client journey.   In the absence of a Branding Message people will fill the void with assumptions of their own that may or may not be accurate.  With this absence of clarity, people are left to draw their own conclusions.  It happens all the time.  You see something one way and someone else sees it another.  This same thing happens with you and your firm.  You clearly see it one way, but many of your clients may see it another.  Many clients are unaware of all you can do for them.  When a client thinks about wealth management, you need to make sure that they see you and your firm as an organization that has the insight and capabilities to judge their needs holistically and help them plan for the long term.  In short, you are the first and only call they need to make. <strong> An effective Personal Branding Message has four main elements. </strong>These elements answer some basic questions about you, your firm and what differentiates you.  The four questions a Personal Branding Message answers are:<br/> <li> <strong>  What do you do?  </strong></li><li> <strong>  How do you do it?  </strong></li><li> <strong>  What are the resources of your firm? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Why do this with you? </strong> <br/>  </li>A Personal Branding Message can be used in whole or in parts depending on the situation; it can be shortened or lengthened as needed.  Two people with the same job function can have two different Branding Messages that are still consistent with a firm's value proposition.  Each of the four points serves a unique purpose so the words you choose matter.  When completed, your Personal Branding Message is not meant to be read word for word in a robotic fashion; but rather it is meant to be internalized and changed to fit each unique situation.   <strong> Start by building your Personal Branding Message one point at a time.</strong>  Each point is designed to generate interest and solicit more inquiry on behalf of your audience.  Breaking your message into points allows you to draw on all or just certain parts of the message, depending on the circumstances.  Your final Personal Branding Message will be made up of the phrases and terms that are rooted in  your firm's value proposition and commingled with your own personal perception of how you add value to your clients.  The resulting unique message will help differentiate you from the alternatives and the competition in market.  <strong> Remember the words you choose must be your own. </strong>The samples provided here are meant to show \"What Good Looks Like.\"  You need to come up with your own unique Personal Branding Message. <strong> The first point really answers the question &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; </strong>Some might call this an elevator speech.  It is a short message that captures the essence of what you do for your clients.  Here is an example: \"We work comprehensively with our clients&rsquo; wealth management plans to help them achieve the goals that are most important to them and their families.\" <strong> If you hold yourself out to be a wealth manager then it is important to emphasize that you can help clients manage all their wealth planning needs. </strong>This is particularly important if the legacy identity of your role or even your firm may be narrowly focused in just one area, such as private banking, investment management or even brokerage.  No doubt that as your firm and your role evolved to include a more comprehensive set of solutions in your offering, too many clients and prospects had an incorrect perception of what you could do for them.  It is likely that this still persists to this day.  You have clients that may not understand the full breath of your capabilities.  Therefore it is important to use words that capture a more holistic, planning-based, comprehensive approach to managing wealth. <strong> The second point answers the question \"How do you do it?\"</strong> This might have more talking points to it than the first point because you are describing, at a very high level, your process for managing wealth.  To be clear, this is not a product push.  You always want to begin with the client&rsquo;s goals in mind.  However, one way to build trust and rapport is to demonstrate competence. Clearly and concisely articulating your process demonstrates competency.  Here is an example: \"We utilize a defined and disciplined approach to help our clients make decisions.  Our focus is always helping our clients maximize the likelihood of realizing their goals.  We have found that there are thirteen common wealth planning challenges that are likely to come up in course of anyone's financial life.  Therefore we have built our process around helping our clients to look out on the horizon and identify the areas for focus and attention so that we can help them put in place the appropriate plans and solutions to ensure their success.  This helps ensure that clients will be able to stay on track and accomplish the goals that they have set out for themselves and their families.\" Be certain that in this second point you describe how you work with clients to help them address the important challenges or realize the financial goals that you have identified in your own process.  If the setting is appropriate, show an example of the supporting collateral material that highlights your process.  When you do this, you create engagement.  People are able to see the tangible areas where you can help them.  Don't use a list of products and services here.  No one wakes up in the middle of the night thinking, \"I need Trust Services\"; instead they may wake up thinking \"What am I going to do with my business given the fact that my kids are a mess?\"  A list of challenges or goals is going to connect emotionally with the client. And that's where decisions are made, in the part of our brain that is responsible for our emotions.   <strong> The third point is to answer the question \"What are the resources of your firm?\"</strong> Here you can reference the vast array of services of your firm.  Highlight your firm's commitment to serving the wealth needs of your clients.  This may be of particular importance if your firm has a legacy identity that may be more aligned with another arena of financial services such as consumer or commercial banking.  It is critical that you appropriately position your capabilities to highlight all the solution categories available on your shelf.  \"Standing behind me are the vast resources of my firm, which includes a diversified suite of banking, investment and insurance solutions.  Additionally I have access to the professionals and specialists who can help you match the right solutions to your plan.  It&rsquo;s important you know that all of us here are committed to some simple but important core values.  Our firm has been doing this for over fifty years with the sole purpose of providing sound advice and exceptional service to the people and the families we serve.  This is reflected in the diversity of wealth products and services that we have developed to meet the needs of our clients.\"   When you discuss this third point you can speak to the specific resources of your firm, your core values or purpose, the size and scope of your firm &ndash;&ndash; any of these are appropriate.  What you are really doing here is sharing some of the important credentials of  your firm.   <strong> In the fourth point &ldquo;Why do this with you?,&rdquo; talk about how you deliver this service in a very personalized way.</strong> If you are local, capitalize on your proximity to the client; if not, highlight the way you make yourself or your team accessible to clients.  Provide some specific examples of your commitment to providing an outstanding client experience. \"Best of all our entire team is right here in (use your location), and all of us our committed to delivering an outstanding client experience.&rdquo; or \"Best of all I am just a phone call away, as is everyone on our team.\"  When you discuss your team and your client experience, share some specific promises that you make to you clients of the things that you commit to deliver consistently.  These do not have to be monumental promises.  They can be the little things.  But they are the things you know will appeal to your client.  Some examples include returning calls the same day, developing personalized communication plans for each client, and promising to each client the opportunity to develop a written financial plan and reviewing it annually. &ldquo;My team members and I are passionately committed to help each individual client accomplish their goals.  We recognize that information is critical and that time is of the essence, that is why we work with each client to develop a personalized communication plan, so that our clients will have the information they need to make decisions to protect their interests and stay on track to their goals.&rdquo; <strong> Additionally, personalize your message with some specific things about you. </strong>One of the best ways to determine what you should say here is to reflect on the things you have heard from clients.  Think back on the times when your clients have complimented you or thanked you for the way you worked with them.  Those comments are evidence of how you personally add value.  These \"endorsements\" are very powerful statements when they are linked to the fact that these are things your clients have told you.   &ldquo;What my clients have told me they value most is that I have a clear methodology for helping them stay focused and on track to achieving their goals.\" <strong> The way you introduce yourself and the words you choose will have a lasting impact throughout the entire client journey.</strong> First impressions go a long way to confirming or correcting any preconceived ideas about who you are and what you do.  And it is important to repeat the message as often as you can.  If a prospect or client does not perceive you in the right way it will limit your ability to engage them in the kind of discussions required to serve their wealth needs.  When that happens not only does it mean lost opportunity for you and your firm, it also means that potentially your client is being undeserved in an area where they may need the most help. ",

    "content": "<p> What happens when you set the goal, take the right actions, and still don't achieve it?</p><p> You set the goal. You made sure it was specific, realistic, and measurable. You created the action plan and followed through consistently.  </p><p> The deadline arrives and...you didn't reach the goal.  </p><p> Ugh.   </p><p> We've all experienced this disappointment. Sometimes we know what happened; other times it seems beyond explanation. I've had new coaching clients admit that they're hesitant to set goals for fear they may not reach them. (We work through that fear pretty quickly.) ;-)  </p><p> So what do you do when you miss the mark? Wallow? Decide goals aren't for you? Label yourself a failure and just quit?  </p><p> I hope not. If that's the answer, I should have given up on goals years ago!  </p><p> Let me put this in perspective.  Imagine your best friend is overweight and sets a goal to lose 100 pounds in one year. He exercises, works with a nutritionist, and does all the right things. One year later, he has only lost 95 pounds.  Is he a failure?  </p><p> When I pose this scenario in seminars, I hear a resounding, \"No!\" But he set a goal and didn't reach it. Why is he not a failure?  </p><p> Which brings us to the meaning and purpose of goals: It's not about the goal, it's not about the destination. It's about who you become in the process. It's about your transformation. </p><p> In that scenario, yes, your friend fell short of the goal. But he changed his lifestyle. He learned to make better choices. He lost 95 more pounds than he would have had he not set the goal.  </p><p> And I'd be willing to bet he goes on to lose the additional 5 pounds, achieving the goal - just in a slightly different time frame.  </p><p> (Now, I can hear some of you saying, \"That's all fine and good. But my job depends on me reaching my goals.\"</p><p> When you don't reach your goal, take some time to debrief. Ask yourself a few questions, like:</p><p> What lessons did you learn that you can take into your next goal?</p><p> Was the goal specific? Meaningful? Timely? </p><p> What did you do that worked? </p><p> What didn't work? </p><p> What helped? </p><p> What might help more in the future?</p><p> As you move forward, make sure you set specific, meaningful goals that resonate deeply. Break them into consistent, manageable pieces. Take action every day - even (especially!) the days you don't feel like it. </p><p> Make sure you celebrate what you do accomplish, even if it's not quite to the level you had planned. Then, take a breather, get yourself in a strong and positive mental state, line up your support, and go for your next goal. </p><p> We all fall short of our goals from time to time. But what if your job depends on you reaching them?</p><p> Even the highest-achieving goal-setters fall short of their aim from time to time. In some cases, you can easily pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and move to the next goal. But, sometimes the consequences are high, such as when your job depends on your successful goal achievement. What then?</p><p> When you set a goal and don't achieve it, here are some things that definitely will not help: blame, excuses, cover-ups, denial, dwelling. Not only do these responses reflect negatively on you, they disrupt your integrity and stunt future goal achievement.</p><p> Instead, be honest. Debrief with the questions I shared above, to learn from the experience. </p><p> Share with your supervisor what you feel you could have done differently, and ask for her suggestions as well. Enter the conversation with a game plan. </p><p> Evaluate your strengths and how (or perhaps, if) they come into play with your goals - and how you could bring those strengths more to the forefront.</p><p> And, of course, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and move forward. As you do so, keep these tips in mind:</p><p> Setting yourself up for success early in the goal-setting process is especially important when the stakes are high. Start by breaking your goal into sub-goals, milestones, and consistent actions.  In my coaching work, I often help clients set one-year goals, which we then break down into quarterly, monthly, weekly, and even daily segments. It's difficult to know on a Tuesday in January when action will make your December goal a reality, but it's easy to see what action on that Tuesday will help you hit your weekly milestone.</p><p> Make sure to gain your supervisor's input early and frequently. Just like you wouldn't want to hear about a performance issue for the first time at your annual review, your leaders don't want to be surprised without time to help you course-correct if necessary.</p><p> Shoot for big wins early in the game. When you kickstart into action, you will gain momentum quickly and be less likely to feel the need to scramble later.</p><p> Most importantly, line up your support. Often an objective coach, in tandem with your supervisor, can provide the guidance and resources to help you kick your goal into high gear. </p><p> For example, one of my executive coaching clients was responsible for increasing sales 20% in one year - an incredibly lofty goal in her department and industry. Part of her felt invigorated by the challenge; part of her freaked out about actually being able to achieve it. </p><p> She hired me early and we created quarterly, monthly, weekly, all the way down to daily actions needed to stay on course. We examined her  <u>  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/Blog/tabid/152/post/create-your-quick-success-stoplight/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Success Stoplight  </a> </u> , eliminating tasks she did not need to continue. She was able to exceed the goal whileimproving her work/life balance and keeping meaning and purpose at the forefront. Whether you hire MAP Inc. or someone else, get a certified coach in your corner. You will be glad you did.</p><p> As a recovering perfectionist, I understand that setting a goal and not achieving it is, well, not fun. But it happens, and like most un-fun experiences, it usually prompts significant growth. </p><p> Learn from the experience, set the stage for success moving forward, then grow forth!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Every once in a while we encounter hurtful comments or have difficult conversations to look forward to that are either job or client based.  On occasion sleepless nights are experienced due to the anger inside.  But, anger doesn't help the effort to find a potential solution.  </p><p> Should any of this occur during the holiday season, stress is seen at an all-time high and could hinder health.  Consider the following strategies to ease the pain and potentially have them work to your favor.</p><p> <strong>  Rapid Punching </strong></p><p> At home, with no one around, punch your pillow rapidly and with all your might.  It helps to alleviate the anger and stimulate the brain.  Or, if you have access to boxing gloves and punching bag, have at it!  By the time you are through, you will have hurt no one and you just might feel a bit better and ready to proceed to step 2.</p><p> <strong>  Ask Why? </strong></p><p> More relaxed, consider all of the reasons possible for the mean commentary or need for the dreaded upcoming conversation.  From the beginning of the story, what lead to the root cause of this dilemma?  Could it be, personality conflict, omission, misunderstanding&hellip;?</p><p> Walk yourself through all of the details that led to the event turning south along with the upcoming tenuous conversation. List possibilities on a newly created document.</p><p> <strong>  Possibilities </strong></p><p> Out of the entire list, which possibilities to be proposed, in your upcoming meeting, are the most likely to be accepted? Add further details to the ones you like best in order to make your case on the appointed day. Calmly discuss the options to fully comprehend where you stand.</p><p> <strong>  Personality </strong></p><p> You can't change someone's personality.  Sometimes you just have to walk away. However, if you are on a job, keep options open without having to quit.  The easier way to get a new job is to still be employed.  </p><p> Entrepreneurs sometime have to walk away from rude clients or people in their circles if the comments get to them. Remember, opinions are subjective.  It is up to you to accept or reject what is being said.  </p><p> For example, I responded with the following earlier today:Writing style is completely subjective.  Nice Girls DO Get the Sale was professionally edited by a highly reputable publishing house, is an international best-seller, and enjoys top-notch media attention. Yet some still felt inclined to tell me it was poorly written.  Another salesperson and author, that I know, writes with run-on sentences. This is a &ldquo;no-no&rdquo; in the traditional grammatical sense.  However, I found the writing extremely compelling and moving, as did many others.  That book has sold phenomenally well.</p><p> <strong>  Be Yourself </strong></p><p> The worst strategy is to adapt to someone else's wishes.  This kills any remote chance of moving forward let alone being happy with who you have become.  This is called developing your personal brand.  </p><p> When you are tackled at work, by a friend, or in business, be true to your principles, ideals and vision.  It's always good to be nice, but at times you do need to stand up to be heard, particularly after a rough tackle.</p><p> We each have one life to live and it's up to us to live it the way we believe is right for us.

    "link": "10-tips-for-choosing-a-domain-name-for-your-business",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Ready to move your business online? Be prepared &ndash; finding an effective, affordable and available domain name for your business can quickly turn into an exercise in compromise, disappointment and frustration. Be patient, flexible, and follow these 10 guidelines to find the best online address for your business.</p><p> <strong>  1. Align your domain with your brand and vice a versa:  </strong> If you&rsquo;re starting a new business, research available domains before committing to a business name.</p><p> <strong>  2. Find a unique domain name: </strong>  complete a Google search of possible domain names before purchasing to make sure that you&rsquo;re not competing with a prominent brand or unknowingly affiliated with unsavory websites.</p><p> <strong>  3. Try to find a .com. </strong> They are still the standard for business use. However, if a .com is not possible, from an SEO perspective, other gTLD (Generic Top Level Domains) work just as well.  <a href=\"http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  New gTLDs </a>   are becoming available all of the time.</p><p> <strong>  4. Your domain doesn&rsquo;t have to contain your keywords:  </strong> although it can help with branding, it is no longer tied to improved search rankings*.</p><p> *Note: Officially, Google says that it is not a ranking factor, however, some SEOs claim that it still offers a small boost.</p><p> <strong>  5. Your domain should be short and easy to type. </strong></p><p> Example: If you repair windshields in Boise, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t selectboisewindowwelderandrepair (Boise Window Welder and Repair). Although perfectly descriptive of your service, it&rsquo;s not easy to type or read.</p><p> <strong>  6. Hyphens: </strong>  Most &ldquo;Domain&rdquo; guidelines recommend avoiding hyphens in a domain name (i.e. my business.com is better than my-business.com), however, there are times when they can work.</p><p> I would not use a hyphenated domain if the non-hyphenated version is a direct competitor, or business in your geographical market.</p><p> Example: A recent client has an existing pet grooming business (Doggy Clips) and decided it was time for a website. Doggyclips.com was already being used, but as the business serves a local clientele, and Doggyclips.com was in another part of the country, we decided that Doggy-Clips.com would work.</p><p> Additionally, if you&rsquo;ve decided to use a long business name, a hyphen can make it much more readable, and may be a good alternative even when the non-hyphenated version is available.</p><p> In that case, if both are available, consider getting both, use the hyphenated version on your site for readability, but point both at your site so that no matter which domain a user types, they will find your website.</p><p> Example: If your existing business is Boise Real Estate Company and bothboiserealestatecompany.com and boise-real-estate-company.com are available, you could purchase both domains, use the easier to read hyphenated version on your site, but pointed the non-hyphenated address to your site as well. That way, no matter which version the searcher typed in, he/she would end up at your website.</p><p> <strong>  7. Numbers (i.e. 5th vs Fifth): </strong>  Again, most guides recommend against using actual numbers, instead suggesting that the number be spelled out, however, like the hyphen rule, I think that there are circumstances where it can work.</p><p> Example: Another client owns a photography studio called 5th Pictures. He wasn&rsquo;t sure whether to use 5thpictures.com, or fifthpictures. com. He ended up buying both. His site will display 5thPictures.com, but searchers typing in &ldquo;fifthpictures&rdquo; will be redirected to his website.</p><p> <strong>  8. Avoid being too cute or clever with your domain name.  </strong> It&rsquo;s become more common to see online businesses intentionally using misspellings or slang terms which can be confusing to new searchers &ndash; unless of course you set up a re-direct from the traditional spelling as well.</p><p> <strong>  9. Avoid Copyright infringement. </strong></p><p> Example: A web designer, specializing in WordPress web design, may want to include &ldquo;WordPress&rdquo; in her business name. However, &ldquo;WordPress&rdquo; is copyrighted. She could use WP, and then use the word WordPress in her content, but not in her business name.</p><p> <strong>  10. If your business is specific </strong> to one geographical area, use Geo-location terms to differentiate your domain name (i.e. add your City, State, or neighborhood to your URL &ndash; &ldquo;Boiseplumbing.com&rdquo; )</p><p> Finding the right domain name is a big decision, but one that I always find exciting. Keep searching until you find the one that feels right for your brand &ndash; then OWN it!</p><p> Best of luck in your search, and with your new online presence!</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;re looking to grow your business, inspire more referrals, capture more assets per household and retain more clients then you must place a bigger focus on women. Advisors who shift their marketing and communication strategies to appeal more to the women&rsquo;s market immediately inspire more attention from women, gain more respect and appreciation from their husbands and simply attract more new clients of both genders. That&rsquo;s just how it works and how easy it is. You don&rsquo;t have to make major shifts to generate an impact.</p><p> Women want to know you hear them, care about them and are committed to engaging them more consistently so communication is key. All you have to do is incorporate two simple steps:</p><p> <strong>  1. Share Your Story.  </strong> The single most powerful tool is your story about why you care about women.</p><p> Your story can be used with both prospects and clients, it can be shared verbally or in email, posted on your website or on a brochure. Your story is the single most compelling part of your message can be used in every aspect of your marketing and communication and quickly wins the heart of each woman. She needs to know you care more about her and not just about her money and your story tells her why.  Here is a great example of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adrimillerheckman.com/do-you-have-a-story-here-is-a-sample/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   good story  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adrimillerheckman.com/how-to-develop-your-story-as-a-financial-advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   complimentary steps  </a> </u>  to writing your very own story.</p><p> <strong>  2. Constantly Communicate. </strong>  Short, fun female focused emails are the best way to inspire more referrals and show women you care about them.</p><p> Start sending female friendly communication out to every household (segmenting your book will limit your impact). You want these emails to be short, appealing to women and not overly technical. You want the message to inspire and motivate women while educating and encouraging. You can ask meaningful questions that get women thinking, or perhaps a short quiz that lets women evaluate their understanding of risk or taxes and they may even share their results with you.   We have compiled  <u>  seven great examples </u>  of email communication all designed to engage women more effectively and developed libraries of simple but effective emails that women love and makes your job easy.</p><p> Make 2015 the year of the woman, let your clients know that you are committed to helping women become more comfortable and confident when making investment decisions. Using your story followed by engaging emails the women will sit up and listen and the husbands will appreciate the attention you are giving their wives.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Developing your firm&rsquo;s position on responding to a crisis: The Timing Principle</p><p> Years ago, when I first started managing crisis communications for a major financial services provider, my husband created a music playlist to accompany my commute (and work) for the most challenging of crisis response days.  The playlist included The Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;Another Tricky Day&rdquo; along with some well-known songs from various &ldquo;Rocky&rdquo; film soundtracks. Having the right theme songs to get you through the crisis du jour is certainly helpful, but having a pre-planned position on how you respond to a crisis is critical.</p><p> Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t a cookie-cutter solution for every crisis, or every business. But there are some basic principles you can develop to help guide your crisis communications response. Once you have these principles established, you&rsquo;ll save precious time when you&rsquo;re in the moment.</p><p> Over the next few weeks I&rsquo;ll share some of the principles I&rsquo;ve seen at play in crisis communications from both direct experience, and observation of others.  In this post, I&rsquo;m presenting some thoughts about the principle of timing.</p><p> How you time your communication to employees, clients, and the public is one of the first key principles in your crisis response plan. Here are some questions to consider:</p><li> How quickly are you going to communicate? The impulse may be &ldquo;ASAP&rdquo; but you&rsquo;ll want to weigh the communication timeline with the facts you have on hand. Depending on the situation, you may not want to go there out with something that is not complete, or incorrect.</li><li> What is the order in which you&rsquo;ll communicate? For example, you may want to build in enough time to make sure that all internal stakeholders are communicated to first, before they may hear about the issue from a client (awkward!).</li><li> What are the legal obligations around the timing of a communication? This is where your legal and compliance experts can help you determine any hard requirements, based on the issue at hand. There may even be finer details, like what requirements are there at a state level.</li><li> What are the physical limitations on timing? This starts to get into another key principle&mdash;channel. If you need to mail a written communication to a population, there are going to be additional challenges when it comes to time. Especially if it is a large mailing. It may be good to establish ahead of time (i.e. before the next crisis) what typical turnaround schedules might exist for print production. You may even go so far as having a print vendor or letter shop at the ready for urgent situations.</li><p> Give these questions some thought, and perhaps even start a draft document for your crisis response plan. Or if you have one documented already, consider reviewing it to make sure these questions are addressed.</p><p> Next up: message</p>",

    "link": "money-mistakes-women-make-during-divorce",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Steph Wagner </u></p><p> More than half of all divorced women  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.allianzlife.com/retirement/retirement-insights/women-money-and-power/bag-lady\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fear they will end up a &ldquo;bag lady.&rdquo;  </a> </u>  Even high net-worth women are concerned they&rsquo;ll run out of money and won&rsquo;t be able to support themselves or their families.</p><p> I get it: I&rsquo;ve been there. Living through my own divorce &mdash; and advising the numerous women with whom I&rsquo;ve worked &mdash; I&rsquo;ve seen how all too often, given the financial and emotional toll divorce takes, women focus on &ldquo;just getting through it&rdquo; and turn their attention away from money matters.  </p><p> Yes, divorce can be emotionally and financially devastating. But, it can also be a time of opportunity &mdash; a chance for a fresh start and to establish a solid financial foundation from which to build your next chapter &mdash; and your success depends on the steps you take. Here are five money mistakes to avoid during the divorce process.   </p><p> <strong>   1.     Thinking Your Lawyer Is a Financial Expert </strong></p><p> While a family law attorney generally assumes many roles throughout a case &mdash; a legal expert, a therapist, and even a shoulder to cry on &mdash; most divorce lawyers will agree that they are not financial experts. Having a solid understanding of the law does not equate to a solid understanding of things like how to value stock options; calculate the tax consideration of taking one asset over another; value a defined benefit retirement plan; or identify hidden income. </p><p> In order to ensure you receive the most equitable settlement possible, you need to equip yourself with a comprehensive team. This includes not only a family law attorney, but also a financial expert(s). <br/> <br/> <strong>  2.     Letting Your Emotions Do the Talking </strong></p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s insisting on keeping the house before determining if you can really afford it; throwing in the towel before assessing your true financial snapshot; or sabotaging your settlement by posting libelous remarks about your estranged husband on Facebook at 1:00 a.m.; too often women make critical decisions about their divorce without thoroughly analyzing the impact their actions could have on their financial future. For example, retaining your home may be the greatest decision you make during your divorce, but itmust be for economic reasons. Ignoring the fact that you may not be able to afford the property taxes, maintenance expenses, and homeowners insurance could be financially devastating. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3.     Having No Access to Cash </strong></p><p> Cash is king!  Although it is wise to have a diversified list of assets on your balance sheet post-divorce, there is arguably no greater resource than a liquid asset during the year following a split. After all, you will likely have furniture to buy, dishes to replace, or a security deposit to provide.</p><p> Unfortunately, during divorce, many women do not have a comprehensive understanding of the assets that make up their balance sheet. Often times assets like automobiles, boats, and furniture (which are depreciating);  retirement accounts (which have significant penalties and tax consequences if liquidated); and real estate (which can generate high carrying and closing costs) are selected over good old cash. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4.     Not Adequately &ldquo;Insuring\" Child or Spousal Support Payments </strong></p><p> Successfully negotiating the dollar amount of your support &mdash; child and/or spousal &mdash; is only the first step in securing that income. Next, you need to insure it, and life insurance policies are a great place to start. </p><p> Begin by checking whether your existing policies have death benefits large enough to cover the <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    present value  </a> </u>  of future support payments. Some variables to consider include the age of your children, amount of time you were married, inflation rate, and tax adjustments. (Note: spousal support is taxable while death benefits typically are not.)</p><p> Then, negotiate so that the ownership of that policy is transferred to you. Simply becoming a beneficiary is not enough. If your soon-to-be ex does not agree to this condition, consult with the insurance company directly before finalizing your agreement. You must ensure that you will remain the beneficiary as long as a support order is in place, and that you will be notified immediately if premiums are missed.</p><p> Finally, if you need to purchase a new policy, negotiate the premiums into your settlement so that the supporting spouse covers the cost.  After all, it is insuring his liability.  </p><p> A word of caution: In certain circumstances the ownership of a life insurance policy may trigger unnecessary and extreme estate tax liability. Therefore, it is extremely important that you consult with an estate planning attorney to ensure property procedures and structures are considered. <br/> <br/> <strong>  5.     Not Accepting That Your Standard of Living will Change  </strong></p><p> Maintaining your pre-divorce lifestyle <a href=\"/category/solutions/divorce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   could cost you 25 percent to 50 percent  </u>    </a> more once one household is split into two. As a result, your standard of living is likely to plummet almost  <u>  <a href=\"/category/solutions/divorce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   30 percent  </a> </u> .</p><p> Be proactive! The quicker you embrace your &ldquo;new normal,&rdquo; the faster you can create a life you can afford to love. Rather than living within your means, live below your means. Nothing is more liberating than generating a surplus each month to replenish the savings and investment accounts that were just slashed in half.  </p><p> Navigating divorce is challenging, both emotionally and financially, but how you handle your money matters will have a significant impact on your future. And trust me, it is worth switching to boxed wine for a while! Because if you do this right, the challenges are only temporary.</p>",

In 2009, neuroscientists at New York University and Harvard University identified the neural systems involved in forming first impressions of others. The findings, which show how we encode social information and then evaluate it in making initial judgments, also suggest that it&rsquo;s not just one thing that people judge about us in those seven short seconds after meeting us, but at least eleven different factors. These include</p><li> Socioeconomic level</li><li> Education level</li><li> Competence and honesty, believability, and perceived credibility</li><li> Sex role identification</li><li> Level of sophistication</li><li> Trustworthiness</li><li> Level of success</li><li> Ethnicity</li><li> Religious background</li><li> Political background</li><li> Social / sexual / professional desirability <br/>  </li><p> Different contexts of the first meeting&mdash;professional, social, romantic&mdash; will rearrange these factors according to varying levels of importance. In the case of a job interview, the interviewer is not supposed to consider sex role identification, ethnicity, religious background, political background, or sexual desirability in his or her professional imprint of a candidate. These factors need to score zero. But other factors become hugely important, including competence, honesty, believability, credibility, and trustworthiness.</p><p> In contrast, if you&rsquo;re introduced to a potential romantic partner, the imprint values will be rearranged. In such a situation, number eleven&mdash; social/sexual/professional desirability&mdash;will probably leap to the top of the list, along with sex role identification. If the person fails these two tests, nothing else will matter.And if you bring home your new partner to meet your mother, you know which factor will be number one&hellip;. yep, it&rsquo;s probably going to be socioeconomic level (mothers tend to be pragmatic about these things).</p><p> Look at the mirror right now. What does your appearance let people think about you &ndash; based on those 11 factors?</p>",

You don&rsquo;t need that kind of negativity in your life!!</p><p> Recently,  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/12/12/liam-neeson-taken-linkedin/?utm_cid=mash-com-fb-main-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mashable wrote  </a> </u>  about a very different kind of disruption on LinkedIn.  &lsquo;TAK3N&rsquo; with Liam Neeson is a movie running a promotion through LinkedIn and it&rsquo;s really nothing short of brilliant:  You simply go to their LinkedIn page, follow their page by Dec 23 (2014) and you will be entered into a contest to have your skills endorsed by the movie character, Brian Mills, as well as having a video recorded that you can put on your LinkedIn profile.</p><p> Crazy?  Absolutely!  Irrelevant?  Absolutely not!</p><p> For many in financial services you might not be able to add the endorsement due to compliance, I get it.  I&rsquo;m talking about the disruption part of this social media promotion; that part you might be able to get around.</p><p> All too often broker-dealers and compliance officers are talking to advisors about all these approvals that are needed on financial articles to make sure they are consumer-approved.  I also get this too, but what if you could post non-financial related matter in real-time without approval?  What if you disrupted your own postings to be more human-like and shared content on occasion that disrupted the norm?</p><p> That&rsquo;s all this movie promotion is about and you can do the same thing.  This is completely scale-able to your unique audience, offering and value proposition.  What if you put a video on your LinkedIn page of you going crazy at your favorite football team&rsquo;s game?  That isn&rsquo;t what someoneexpects to see on a profile &ndash; and that&rsquo;s the whole point of disruption!</p><p> How could you be different (and still be compliant)?  Maybe it&rsquo;s changing your LinkedIn profile picture every month with a different hat or background that featured a prominent holiday?  Seems silly &ndash; but probably very memorable.  What if you started sending video messages to your clients instead of a regular email?  Why not be different?</p><p> Different is a good thing.  Disruption is an exceptional thing.</p><p>  </p> ",

    "content": "<p> Your corporate brand is shaped by everything your company does. More and more, even the smallest details of your company&rsquo;s behavior are now plainly visible to the people you serve and the people you want to serve.</p><p> Brands have always been defined by how a company&rsquo;s public (customers, clients and prospects) feels about it. The difference for your company today is that you are no longer in the driver&rsquo;s seat. When it comes to orchestrating the impressions that mold your audiences&rsquo; feelings about your company, you now have to share that influence with your customers.</p><p> If your company is interested in polishing its brand (and you should be), you should seek to build an authentic relationship with your public. To do that, you need to be acutely aware of how your public regards you. You also need to understand how members of your public can contribute &ndash; individually and collectively &ndash; to your brand&rsquo;s positioning.</p><p> Beyond what you tell the marketplace with your advertising, websites, publications and through other &ldquo;official&rdquo; channels, how your public feels about your company can be profoundly influenced by your company&rsquo;s behavior as a corporate citizen. For this reason, the causes and charities you give to should be considered as deliberately as any business strategy.</p><p> Listed below are three tips to help you develop a cohesive philanthropic strategy that aligns with your brand, communicates your values and integrates seamlessly with your other branding activities.</p><p> <strong>  Give with Purpose </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to approach philanthropy on an ad-hoc basis, merely reacting to requests from nonprofits and employees. Most companies get more requests for donations than they could ever possibly fund. So too often, the result is a lot of smaller gifts spread across a large swath of charitable causes and services with no intuitive link to your brand.</p><p> Instead, think about what you want to accomplish as a donor. What conditions in your community do you want to see improved, and how can you be a legitimate force for positive change?</p><p> I suggest identifying 3 or 4 areas where you want to focus your giving. At one financial services company where I was engaged, our overriding giving mission was to improve the prospects for financial self-reliance among people in the communities where we operated. For us, that meant focusing our gifts on education, particularly to improve financial literacy, and human services to support people and families in transition.</p><p> Please note that having a &ldquo;giving mission&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t preclude occasional gifts to nonprofits that don&rsquo;t fit in the category(s) you&rsquo;re focused on. Your budget should have room to support special requests and local or business-specific giving opportunities.</p><p> <strong>  Leverage Your Authority </strong></p><p> As a donor and corporate citizen, your philanthropic activities should align with your company&rsquo;s business mission and expertise &ndash; areas where you have a uniquely well-informed perspective on relevant issues and their solutions.</p><p> Nike provides a perfect example. The global athletic shoe and apparel company gives generously to fitness related programs all over the world. The connection between what the company does and the causes it supports is clear and common sense. Importantly, it also serves an important and widely recognized public health concern: improved health through improved fitness.</p><p> Your donations should honestly reflect your company&rsquo;s wisdom and values. They should also avoid controversy. Unless you are known for taking bold stands on divisive issues, don&rsquo;t consider causes that might inflame of alienate your public.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t Just Write a Check </strong></p><p> Get your employees and your customers involved. Support and incentivize your employees with paid volunteer time. Share good news about the accomplishments you are helping to fund and implement.</p><p> Getting your people involved with the causes your company cares about can make a big difference in their engagement. Employees who are invested in what your company stands for are much better brand ambassadors than employees who simply know what your company does. The same goes for customers.</p><p> Look for ways to partner with the nonprofits you support. Yoplait Yogurt has done an exceptional job in support of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Through philanthropy and cause related marketing, Yoplait has brought heightened awareness to a vitally important problem. At the same time, they have reinforced their brand positioning as a company dedicated to improved health for women and their families.</p><p> In this season of giving, I hope your company is in a position to give generously to the causes you and your constituents care about. By giving strategically, with purpose, intention and inclusion, you can really make a difference. The fact that doing so can also brighten your brand is, well, icing on the Christmas cake.</p><p> What companies do you admire or patronize because of their charitable activities? Are there certain companies who do a particularly good job of integrating their business and charitable activities? How does your company use its charitable activities to help distinguish itself in the marketplace?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://www.camponeventures.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Madding King  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Apple Pay has arrived. </strong></p><p> Everyone has been talking, writing, tweeting, and fighting about it. But is the mainstream actually using it?</p><p> Will it replace cash transactions? In my opinion, at this moment, NO. <br/> Here are the three biggest challenges to Apple Pay&rsquo;s success:</p><p> <strong>  1) Merchants Are Mad </strong></p><p> Apple Pay is not going to succeed unless they can persuade merchants to accept the new form factor. You cannot have a payment system without having both merchants AND consumers.</p><p> Although it is great to tout that over 1 million people loaded cards into the Apple Pay wallets in the first 72-96 hours when it went &lsquo;live&rsquo;, if the consumers do not have any place to actually use it, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The people that are running Apple Pay obviously realize this, but it&rsquo;s still interesting that merchants are reluctant to embrace a technology that a decent number of consumers have indicated that they want to use.</p><p> That decision is most likely informed by the experiences that large merchants in the US have had over the past two decades. Large merchants in particular do not feel that existing payment technologies are delivering value at a level that would justify the cost and they have been quite vocal about it. Merchants have initiated two enormous anti-trust cases, and they&rsquo;ve even prompted the Department of Justice to bring the third. The merchants have also engaged in an intense lobbying campaign in Washington DC to limit the fees that they pay in connection with payment cards. From the merchants&rsquo; perspective, Apple Pay just does not solve a problem that they are willing to pay to have solved. The fact that many merchants are still not willing to get on board shows just how big the divide in the industry is at this point.</p><p> <strong>  2) Changing to Chips </strong></p><p> Apple Pay, like all new payment technologies, is a long term play. I do not think it&rsquo;s success should be judged on a day-to-day, week-to-week, or even a quarter-to-quarter basis. From a merchant&rsquo;s perspective, payments technology is going to change significantly in the next three to five years. Why? Card networks have announced rules that have effectively created an incentive for merchants to change the technology at the point-of-sale.</p><p> Although the new cards being issued now and over the next few years will not look much different than the plastic cards we have had in the past, the new cards also have a computer chip. All cards will continue to have a backwards compatible mag stripe, but we will see a migration towards transactions that happen with the chip instead of the mag stripe.</p><p> Apple Pay is designed to take part of that change. The problem is that Apple Pay uses near field communication (NFC) to communicate at the point-of-sale, so merchants will also need to incorporate that technology to accept Apple Pay.</p><p> At the end of the day, Apple Pay is only going to be interesting to the extent that people use it- and consumers can only use it if merchants are willing to accept it. So by definition, Apple Pay can&rsquo;t win if merchants do not want to use them.</p><p> <strong>  3) Consumers Care Less </strong></p><p> Why are consumers going to adopt any of these technologies? Cards and cash work great. That being said, the smartphone could work, and there are several interesting things you could do with the phone as an identifying device to create a better experience.</p><p> The fact that you still have to enter your PIN using Apple Pay slows down the convenience factor needed to make usage go mainstream. Even though the phone knows who you are and that you are the only person authorized to use your Apple Pay &ldquo;debit card&rdquo;- you still have to provide more identifying information to the terminal to initiate the transaction! Not the most seamless experience.</p><p> It does not seem likely to me that this technology is going to be adopted en masse any time soon absent significant investment to engage both consumers and merchants. Mobile payments are a two-party game. You need the consumers AND the merchants to make it work.</p><p> That being said, I do hope this does take off. I would love to have one less item in my pocket!</p><p> What do you think? What was your experience using Apple Pay? Do you agree or disagree with me?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://markccrowley.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark C. Crowley  </u> </a></p><p> &ldquo;The future is already here, it&rsquo;s just not evenly distributed.&rdquo;  &ndash; William Gibson</p><p> A close friend and former colleague of mine recently advised me to &ldquo;go easy&rdquo; on my use of the expression &ldquo;lead from the heart.&rdquo;  Fully aware that I&rsquo;d written a book with that title, he nevertheless sought to warn me that many people in business continue to believe this is a particularly weak idea. My friend was, of course, looking out for my best interests, and the truth is, I knew he was right.  I&rsquo;ve met with with many senior executives who gave me their polite attention &ndash; but conveyed through invisible signals their deep resistance to bringing any amount of heart into workplace management. You see, for as long as most of us have been alive, business has believed it best to lead with our minds &ndash; and never the heart. But I&rsquo;ve just finished reading five new books that collectively prove our views of leadership are undergoing a profound change. Insight from a Stanford University professor, the all-time winningest NBA coach, two geniuses of innovation and design, a Pulitzer Prize recipient and best-selling author &ndash; and one of Wall Street&rsquo;s most respected CEOs &ndash; all provide a clear view of the future.  What they unequivocally show is that the way to excel in managing human beings in the 21st Century requires breaking away from traditional beliefs. Drawing upon extraordinary personal success in addition to unimpeachable new research, they prove that authentically caring about the growth and well-being of workers &ndash; and ensuring they&rsquo;re consistently made to feel heard, valued, supported and appreciated &ndash; already have become the truly differentiated practices of our best leaders.  The bottom-line conclusion from this collection of thought: having a great mind alone no longer can make you an effective leader; you also need an active and engaged heart:</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/0345472322/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419284268&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mindset+the+new+psychology+of+success+by+carol+dweck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCCESS   </a>  </u>   / CAROL DWECK  </strong></p><p> The traditional view in business is that people are born with a fixed amount of intelligence and talent; individual capabilities are firmly set in stone. This idea, what Stanford University professor, Carol Dweck, calls a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; influences workplace managers to leverage employees who quickly display natural ability &ndash; and to invest little time and resources seeking to develop all the others. Benjamin Bloom, eminent educational researcher, studied 120 outstanding achievers in numerous fields &ndash; world-class athletes, mathematicians, concert pianists, et al &ndash; and discovered few of them were remarkable as children. They only revealed their capabilities once their training began in earnest. Predicated on this and other remarkable research, Dweck blows up the long-enduring paradigm of human limitation.  She proves that a person&rsquo;s potential is &ldquo;unknown and unknowable.&rdquo;  Regardless of talent, aptitude and IQ &ndash; people can greatly expand their abilities through effort, thoughtful coaching, and experience. Dweck&rsquo;s work represents a hugely expansive idea in business.  She shows that leaders who possess a fixed mindset greatly limit employee (and, therefore, organizational) performance.  Alternatively, when managers foster a &ldquo;growth mindset,&rdquo; they intentionally challenge, mentor, and nurture the development of their people knowing their future contributions will expand as they sprout new competencies.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Eleven-Rings-Success-Phil-Jackson/dp/0143125346/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419284310&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=eleven+rings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    ELEVEN RINGS   </a>  </u>   / PHIL JACKSON </strong></p><p> Widely considered the greatest coach in NBA history, Phil Jackson won a record 11 championships &ndash; 6 with the Chicago Bulls and 5 with the Los Angeles Lakers &ndash; and led his teams to victory in over 70% of the games they played. Jackson was a standout college player, and won two &ldquo;rings&rdquo; as a player with the New York Knicks.  But once he was given his own teams to lead, he broke all the traditions of coaching professional athletes.</p><p> Knowing that many players had a tendency to get down when they weren&rsquo;t scoring well &ndash; or when their team had fallen far behind &ndash; he taught them mindfulness techniques, and the importance of staying focused in the present moment. Seeking to build a high degree of trust, he met with players individually, and intentionally learned about their backgrounds and motivations.  &ldquo;I cared for them as a person,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;not just a basketball factotum.&rdquo; Highly influenced by a lifelong study of Zen Buddhism, native American practices, and classical Chinese philosophy &ndash; to name only a few of his ancient wisdom sources &ndash; he placed extraordinary emphasis on selfless teamwork and collaboration.  He taught players that winning in any aspect of life is inextricably linked to personal character and inner strength.  To this end, he openly sought to influence and motivate them spiritually. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend to be an expert in leadership theory,&rdquo; Jackson writes.  &ldquo;But what I do know is that the art of transforming a group of young, ambitious individuals into an integrated championship team is not a mechanistic (X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s) process.  It&rsquo;s a mysterious juggling act that requires not only a thorough knowledge of the time honored laws of the game, but also an open heart, a clear mind and a deep curiosity about the ways of the human spirit.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Confidence-Unleashing-Potential-Within/dp/038534936X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419284364&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=CREATIVE+CONFIDENCE%3A+UNLEASHING+THE+CREATIVE+POTENTIAL+WITHIN+ALL+OF+US\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    CREATIVE CONFIDENCE: UNLEASHING THE CREATIVE POTENTIAL WITHIN ALL OF US   </u>  </a>  / TOM KELLEY AND DAVID KELLEY </strong></p><p> We don&rsquo;t always think of creativity as being essential to leadership success, yet a recent IBM survey of more than 1,500 CEOs reports that its become the single most important competency in organizations today. And few people know more about the creative process &ndash; the ability to produce something new in the world &ndash; than the two Kelley brothers.  David is a founder of IDEO, arguably the most influential design and innovation firm in the world &ndash; and head of Stanford University&rsquo;s design school (&ldquo;d.school&rdquo;).  Tom is general manager of IDEO, the company that invented Apple&rsquo;s first mouse and the Pringle potato chip, and has received 346 design awards since the firm was founded in 1991. In a book that was written after David was diagnosed with terminal cancer &ndash; and then miraculously recovered &ndash; the siblings were motivated to share their greatest insights into &ldquo;design thinking.&rdquo;  Approaching their work from an intensely human perspective is the cornerstone of their uncommon process. &ldquo;The notion of empathy and human centeredness is not widely practiced in many corporations,&rdquo; the authors write.  &ldquo;If you do a word association with &lsquo;business person,&rsquo; empathy doesn&rsquo;t come up much.&rdquo;  But for us, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the ability to see and experience through another person&rsquo;s eyes, to recognize why people do what they do.  And we&rsquo;ve found that figuring out what other people need is what leads to the most significant innovations.&rdquo; When creating any new product or system in business, the Kelleys know they must arrive at solutions that are both feasible and economically viable.  But they believe their exceptional success has come from balancing these two factors with an intentional understanding of human needs.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not suggesting that anyone base a career or run an organization solely on feeling, intuition and inspiration,&rdquo; the authors say.  &ldquo;But an over-reliance on the rational and analytical can be just as risky.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Athena-Doctrine-Women-Think-Future/dp/111845295X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419284403&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=THE+ATHENA+DOCTRINE%3A+HOW+WOMEN+AND+THE+MEN+WHO+THINK+LIKE+THEM+WILL+RULE+THE+FUTURE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    THE ATHENA DOCTRINE: HOW WOMEN AND THE MEN WHO THINK LIKE THEM WILL RULE THE FUTURE   </u>  </a>  / MICHAEL D&rsquo;ANTONIO AND JOHN GERZEMA  </strong></p><p> The financial crisis that began in 2007 has had long-enduring impacts on most of our lives.  As sobering examples, nearly 10 million people remain unemployed in the US today, and 1-in-5 homeowners owe more on their homes than they&rsquo;re worth.  According to best-selling author, John Gerzema, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Michael D&rsquo;Antonio, reflection on what caused this catastrophe has influenced our entire society to reassess what qualities are essential to leadership roles going forward. The authors surveyed 64,000 people in 13 countries, and discovered that &ldquo;nearly two-thirds of people around the globe &ndash; including the majority of men &ndash; now feel the world would be a better place if men thought more like women (this is regardless of age, income or nation).&rdquo;  &ldquo;The skills required to thrive in today&rsquo;s world &ndash; such as honesty, empathy, communication, appreciation and collaboration &ndash; are widely regarded as being on the feminine side of human nature,&rdquo; the authors write.  &ldquo;Consequently, we&rsquo;ve reached the end of the hyper-masculine era in leadership as these and many other feminine qualities have become more highly valued&hellip;. More important, the responses show that we collectively seek a more expressive style of manager, one who shares feelings and emotions more openly and honestly.  We want our leaders to be more intuitive, more understanding of other people&rsquo;s feelings, and more able to assess various angles of a problem &ndash; or consequences of an action &ndash; before taking action.&rdquo; Of all the people surveyed, 81% said that, man or woman, you need both masculine and feminine traits to thrive in today&rsquo;s world.  &ldquo;From this point of view,&rdquo; say the authors, &ldquo;an embrace of feminine qualities can be thought of as a competitive advantage, not unlike a breakthrough technology or major market insight.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Onward-Starbucks-Fought-without-Losing/dp/1609613821/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419284442&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ONWARD%3A+HOW+STARBUCKS+FOUGHT+FOR+ITS+LIFE+WITHOUT+LOSING+ITS+SOUL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    ONWARD: HOW STARBUCKS FOUGHT FOR ITS LIFE WITHOUT LOSING ITS SOUL   </u>  </a>  / HOWARD SCHULTZ  </strong></p><p> At the height of the Great Recession, institutional investors hounded Starbucks founder and CEO, Howard Schultz, to eliminate health-care benefits for all its full and part-time workers.  With a stock price at an all-time low, and the coffee purveyor facing a truly ambiguous future, the move would save the company $250 million in annual expenses. In the dark days of the economic meltdown, when fears were running very high in business, many organizations were making the same kinds of draconian moves Schultz now was forced to consider.  But unlike his peers, he took the road less traveled. Schultz began his deliberations by asking himself what kind of company he&rsquo;d be left with once employees no longer received a benefit that had consistently driven high engagement and loyalty.  And a formative childhood experience also proved to hold great sway.  While growing up in Brooklyn, Schultz came home one day to find his father laid up with a broken hip and ankle.  After falling on his route delivering cloth diapers, his company fired him; he was left with no job, no severance and no healthcare coverage. In a book that uses the word &ldquo;heart&rdquo; 33 separate times, Schultz explains that he ultimately decided to bet on his people as being the best means to enduring the financial crisis.  He wagered that his employees, feeling highly valued and supported, would inevitably win back customers suddenly afraid to pay $4.00 for a capuccino.  And contrary to the outcome institutional investors gloomily predicted, the organization greatly succeeded.  In the past five years, Starbuck&rsquo;s stock is up over 400%. &ldquo;Starbucks is living proof that a company can provide long-term value for shareholders without sacrificing its core belief in treating its employees with respect and dignity.&rdquo; writes Schultz.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best way to do business.&rdquo; Conclusion: Our long-enduring resistance to bringing the heart into workplace management deserves a quick explanation.  Traditional leadership theory &ndash; which dates as far back as the industrial revolution &ndash; espouses that workers be treated like any other input: squeeze as much out of them as possible and pay them as little as possible.  This idea originated at a time when work was far less complex and people were more easily replaceable.  Under a scenario like this, managers were taught to ignore the human aspect of employees (what I call &lsquo;&lsquo;heart&rdquo;), and to be indifferent to their needs. Companies motivated performance with pay, often the only reward workers received.  Suffice to say, the reason a great and irreversible transformation is happening in leadership today is because workers &ndash; human beings &ndash; have greatly evolved in what they need and want in exchange for their work.  It&rsquo;s simply a stunning fact that pay now ranks fifth in importance to people as a driver of their engagement, loyalty and productivity &ndash; all around the world. While pay, of course, will always be an important component of one&rsquo;s employment, 21st century employees have a deep desire to thrive in their jobs.  They have a hunger to do meaningful work, to feel connected to an organization they respect, to grow, contribute &ndash; and to know at the end of every week that their efforts were appreciated and valued.As these five paradigm-breaking books now clearly illustrate, the best way to inspiring and motivating the highest levels of engagement in this century&rsquo;s workers is through their hearts.</p>",

    "link": "welcome-to-onionland-innovation-on-the-dark-net",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Alice Bell </u> Some people call it Onionland. An encrypted part of the Internet that allows people to browse with a reasonable amount of anonymity. The onion is a reference to layers of encryption. It is more commonly known, however, as TOR &mdash; from The Onion Router &mdash; or the Dark Net.Jamie Bartlett&rsquo;s spent time studying this Dark Net. In  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/109/1099039/the-dark-net/9780099592020.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   his recent book  </a> </u> , he explores what people do under the conditions of anonymity on all sorts of fringes of the Internet. Considering everything from Internet trolling to anarcho-primitivists, via homemade pornography, neo-Nazis and pro-suicide forums, he readily admitted it was pretty difficult to research and write about at times. &ldquo;They are sort of censorship free,&rdquo; Bartlett explained. &ldquo;And as a result, there&rsquo;s the good, the bad and the ugly all nestled in together.&rdquo;One possible theory of innovation is that even concepts like the Dark Net need as much freedom as possible to thrive. Bartlett said these communities, they &ldquo;sort of stretch freedom to its limits.&rdquo; So is innovation rife on the Dark Net? Yes and no, he answered. It&rsquo;s certainly a hugely inventive place, but neccesity is largely the mother of invention here with creativity often born of contstraint.Take, for example, drug marketplace the Silk Road. &ldquo;It is a pretty hostile place for a market to exist,&rdquo; Bartlett said, as the vendor system is constantly under attack by hackers or the FBI, and there&rsquo;s almost no trust between users. Yet thousands of people still use the Silk Road as a functioning marketplace. Every time it shuts down, it just  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/11/the-evolution-of-evolution-after-silk-road\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   opens up again under a different guise  </a> </u> .Payment mechanisms are a particular challenge. &ldquo;The problem on these sites is you are dealing in drugs and [the digital currency] Bitcoin,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo; ... And drug dealers have a tendency to run off with your Bitcoin. So they&rsquo;ve repeatedly evolved how the payment mechanism works.&rdquo;Try a simple exchange of Bitcoin, and dealers rip you off. Try holding currency on a third-party site until buyers have received their drugs and the site administrators scoop it up. So, Bartlett said, the Silk Road developed something called a multi-signature escrow system. &ldquo;The site, the vendor and the buyer create a wallet on the site and everyone has to use their encryption key to release it. It&rsquo;s only when all three parties are satisfied that the deal&rsquo;s been done that the money&rsquo;s transferred. And in the event of anything failing, it goes back to the buyer.&rdquo;Bartlett continued, &ldquo;What this has all been about has been to work out how on Earth do we create a payment system that is not at the whim of either a drug dealer or a site administrator. And over the course of 18 months, they&rsquo;ve developed something that really works &hellip; They&rsquo;ve had to do it because they&rsquo;re under attack all the time. But it&rsquo;s an incredibly smart and relatively simple way around the problem.&rdquo;Another way to deal with lack of trust on the Silk Road has been user reviews. Bartlett said the quality of drugs is higher for this reason. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s introduced that element of competition and choice with user reviews, forcing vendors to act in the interest of the buyer, because they&rsquo;ll get shit reviews if they don&rsquo;t. And that completely changes the dynamic of the drugs market.&rdquo; There are, predictably, also lots of people trying to manipulate the review system. But a community has grown up around the Silk Road to monitor reviews, some users there more out of belief in the idea of an anonymous marketplace than the drug business. People do this for more than money.It reflects a larger challenge for these communities, Bartlett argued. &ldquo;Anyone who is involved in crypto-anarchy has tried to merge an anonymous system &mdash; where no one needs to give away anything about themselves &mdash; with the system of trust that is essential for any functioning marketplace.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s hard. But the Silk Road&rsquo;s faced that challenge by combining clever tech with complex social systems that keep trust operating and flowing within the community.It&rsquo;s not a cozy society they&rsquo;ve created, though. There&rsquo;s what Bartlett described as &ldquo;a strange paranoia inside there, that everything&rsquo;s tapped, everything&rsquo;s being watched. And you just don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s not just on the heavily encrypted TOR that we see such innovation born from challenge. &ldquo;[These] sort of smart ways of taking technology to create solutions to problems is, I think, generally found in the fringes of Internet subculture,&rdquo; said Bartlett.He offered the example of the far-right, radically anti-Islamic group the English Defence League. &ldquo;In 2009, it was a group of young men from Luton, who didn&rsquo;t have much experience of politics, or much money, but who saw that if they could use Facebook, they could quickly build a political movement at low cost.&rdquo; In the space of about six months, Bartlett explained, the EDL had more Facebook likes than either of the leading UK political parties, adding that across Europe, the far right has been ahead of everyone else on Facebook, drawing on the power of social interactions, memes and forms of gamification.There are other reasons why EDL, et al., have the support they do, but social media has been key in letting them build. &ldquo;We see the English Defence League and we imagine them as a group marching up and down the street,&rdquo; echoing 20th century fascist movements, but Bartlett said that &ldquo;95 percent of their action takes place online.&rdquo;He also spoke with compassion about pro-anorexia and pro-suicide sites, suggesting that they are, in a way, filling a gap left by traditional health services. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s peer-to-peer support networks that people, off their own back, have built and created,&rdquo; he said. The people on these sites have formed a space online to talk to people like them, to feel less alone. &rdquo;It becomes wrapped up in a social setting; it creates a vibrant community of people who look out for each other. That&rsquo;s very powerful if you are feeling isolated and have low levels of self-esteem. There isn&rsquo;t an alternative,&rdquo; he said. There is a lot of destructive behavior here, Bartlett was keen to add, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s still a very self-starting way of trying to resolve this problem. The lack of anywhere to go when you were feeling like that.&rdquo;Returning to the encrypted spaces of TOR, Bartlett explained that some people are driven simply by a desire to solve technological problems. Reflecting on Bitcoin developers, whom he&rsquo;s spent time with, he said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re obsessed with the idea of creating a perfect anonymous payment system that cannot be traced &hellip; For many of these people it&rsquo;s an exciting adventure. They&rsquo;re desperately trying to crack this puzzle.&rdquo;He&rsquo;s seen a fair bit of ideological zeal too, with a basis in radical libertarianism. Developers hope anonymized payment systems could unravel the power of government. If you can&rsquo;t monitor who is paying whom, you can&rsquo;t tax people. If you can&rsquo;t tax people, government falls pretty quickly.One of the more intriguing bits of Bartlett&rsquo;s book explores the Assassination Market, a sort of crowdsourced murder plot where people gamble on when someone is going to die. Anonymity is heavily plotted into the scheme, so there is a way of getting the money without anyone having to expose his or her identity.Crucially, the pool of money can get so large there&rsquo;s a high incentive to place a bet on a specific day, and then follow through with murder. &ldquo;The idea of it was that no public official, bureaucrat or politician would be brave enough to ever hold office, because they&rsquo;d be too scared,&rdquo; said Bartlett. It&rsquo;s a sort of libertarian check on centralized power. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so clever,&rdquo; he said, with muted admiration. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all about seeing if you could murder someone &hellip; I&rsquo;m reading it thinking this is terrible, but it&rsquo;s so damn clever.&rdquo;Open source plays a role here as well. This is partly ideological, as open source fits ideas of freedom common on TOR, be it a freedom rooted in libertarianism, anarchism or something else. But users are also implementing it because it works. Drug dealers use open source software because it&rsquo;s good for business &mdash; a way to cope in that hostile environment. Even ISIS is, sort of, into open source. Or at least, Bartlett explained, it took open source encryption software and made its own closed version of it.&ldquo;Open source code means more pairs of eyes checking it,&rdquo; he said, referring back to the strange paranoia fueling a lot of TOR. &ldquo;Are there any flaws in it, any exploits, any backdoors to allow third parties in, and the more open source it is, the more trust you can have in it &hellip; I think more people have moved towards this model of open source software, partly because they realize that in a world where nobody understands the world fully, the more open it is, the safer it&rsquo;s likely to be,&rdquo; said Bartlett.It&rsquo;s a self-conscious approach to innovation. He added, &ldquo;Many of them open-source stuff because they recognize that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ll come up with brand new ways of doing stuff. They do this knowingly, they write the code in ways that allows others to build on top of it. Because they know there are going to be a million different applications for stuff that they haven&rsquo;t yet thought of.&rdquo;And yet, finally, another layer of innovation comes from people watching the Dark Net. &ldquo;Never underestimate how good the FBI or GCHQ is about getting into these places,&rdquo; Bartlett grinned. Before the Snowden revelations, computer geeks could be condescending about intelligence services, he suggested, but that&rsquo;s changing. &ldquo;Both the Internet itself and the TOR browser are inventions of the U.S. military, for intelligence sharing purposes. So why in the world anyone thought these people would be so behind the curve is absurd to me.&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "Why Focusing on Internal Equity Isn't a Compensation Strategy?",
    "link": "why-focusing-on-internal-equity-isnt-a-compensation-strategy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Outside of my love for both Recruitment and Talent Management lies a fascination with Compensation Strategy. It is the window of opportunity that every company has to compete for talent. Not every company can deal the same cards. Some will lag the market, some will lead and others will mirror the market. Even more fascinating is this sentiment that a person&rsquo;s worth in an organization should be marginalized by the salaries of others- a.k.a. internal equity.</p><p> If you are unaware of internal equity, here is the breakdown in a story: you are courting a new Accountant from the outside. You already have six other accountants company-wide with varying levels of knowledge, skills, abilities and tenure. You ask the new Accountant for their salary requirements; but before you oblige their wish list you check the salary spread across the six individuals you currently employ. In doing so, you find that the lowest paid Accountant gets $65,000 per year and the highest paid Accountant gets $85,000. Your rockstar Accountant candidate is making $85,000 plus a $10,000 per year bonus. To make him whole he is looking for $93,000- 96,000 per year. Despite your salary range of $63,800- $94,000, you decide to offer $87,000 because you would hate to disturb your internal equity among Accountants.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s the issue with this strategy: </strong></p><p> 1) You are likely to either have your candidate decline your offer to move onto greener pastures or he will counteroffer and you get to play that game.</p><p> 2) This person has an MBA, CPA and has worked at KPMG for over 15 years. You only have one other CPA on staff and they don&rsquo;t possess the 15 years of experience at a big firm or an MBA. How can you offer him less when he is more qualified?</p><p> 3) Depending on whether your ranges lag, lead or mimic the market, you may spend a long time trying to make this candidate whole which may become old and eventually push the candidate to seek new opportunities.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like to look at internal equity to give me a barometer for how people are situated salary-wise in the organization. Additionally, it helps you to make equitable decisions regarding both internal and external candidates. However, I have seen companies use it to drive their compensation strategy. It isn&rsquo;t a strategy at all. If someone meets and/or exceeds the functional and strategic needs of your organization, you may have to bust the internal bubble once in a while.</p><p> It is foolhardy to believe that every hire will conform to the confines of your salary structures. The key is to make the right compensation decisions and burst that internal equity bubble only when it makes the most sense. However, inconsistent compensation practices whereby certain employees are paid more and unqualified or under-performing will undoubtedly undermine any aspirations or hopes you have for a fairly compensated workforce. More often than not, I see under-performers that are better compensated than those who perform at or above their pay grade.</p><p> <strong>  What does that say for internal equity? </strong> <br/> <br/> If you truly care about a transparent and fair payment system, you have to start with the premise that every person regardless of race, gender, ethnicity etc. is worth the value they provide to the organization. Salary is just one piece of the puzzle, how else can you leverage rewards, benefits etc. to improve your overall offering. I understand the reasons why internal equity is needed, but as a strategy it is stifling and only as good as your overall compensation practices.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Josh Tong </u>  -  <u>  Theory and practice </u></p><p> Organizations often use social media to broadcast their messages to the largest possible audience. It&rsquo;s true that if even a few people share your content with their own networks, your number of &ldquo;impressions,&rdquo; &ldquo;likes,&rdquo; &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; and &ldquo;followers&rdquo; can add up fast.</p><p> This approach might be good enough if your objective is simply to &ldquo;raise awareness&rdquo; about your product, service, brand, or cause. But most organizations don&rsquo;t fund their operations with Awareness Bucks. And who likes to be spammed by advertising-style social media messages?</p><p> <strong>  Create granular content for targeted audiences </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s often smarter to define objectives that directly support a business need. Then you can send targeted messages to the people who are the most likely to help you achieve your objective.</p><p> Unfortunately, it can be difficult to segment your followers on social media. Jonathan Crossfield recently wrote about one solution&mdash; <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/12/how-to-improve-social-content-results/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media groups  </a> </u> :</p><p> Instead of spraying your content across large numbers of generic followers in the hope of hitting the right target, you may find a ready-made community eagerly consuming the content you want to share.</p><p> I&rsquo;m talking about social media groups, of course. Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+ each has different types of groups, community and/or fan-page functionalities. And these groups allow you to target some incredibly specific niches.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve had success with this approach, but I would add that sometimes the most valuable groups aren&rsquo;t the ones that belong to major social media platforms.</p><p> Sometimes the most valuable social groups are the ones that you might not even think of as social groups.</p><p> <strong>  Learn where your audience goes for information </strong></p><p> If your target audience is active in a particular Facebook group, Google+ community, or LinkedIn discussion group, then you&rsquo;re in luck. If not, keep looking. Chances are that they&rsquo;re having a conversation somewhere online&mdash;but you might need to do some old-fashioned market research to discover where.</p><p> At the relief and development agency where I work, I help colleagues communicate with government donors, international partners, field staff, and researchers. These are diverse groups, and some of their members do use Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook for work.</p><p> But those platforms aren&rsquo;t where most of the conversations happen in the industry. Instead, the most important online conversations happen through discussion lists, discussion boards, newsletters, and blogs.</p><p> My team compiled an inventory of these channels by interviewing staff members and external audiences. We periodically update the inventory as new employees join the agency. Almost every employee can add at least one professional network to the list.</p><p> Our target audiences might not be the most active on Facebook or Twitter, but many of them subscribe to the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hipnet.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Health Information and Publications Network  </a> </u> &rsquo;s discussion list, or they read the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fsnnetwork.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Food Security and Nutrition Network  </a> </u> &rsquo;s e-mail newsletter, or they follow the  <u>  <a href=\"http://aea365.org/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American Evaluation Association  </a> </u> &rsquo;s blog, to give just a few examples.</p><p> Communicating through these channels isn&rsquo;t always glamorous, but it has been effective for us. It allows us to cut through the noise and share valuable content with precisely the people who are looking for it. And when you share valuable information with the right people at the right time, they tend to remember you.</p><p> <strong>  Measure what matters </strong></p><p> This approach might not produce breathtaking vanity metrics. If your boss expects your content to receive hundreds of &ldquo;likes&rdquo; or millions of &ldquo;impressions,&rdquo; you might need to reset expectations. However, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a hard sell if your objectives truly support business needs.</p><p> You might need to set up some custom analytics code in order to measure the right types of information. Don&rsquo;t worry, this doesn&rsquo;t need to be difficult or expensive. In a future post, I&rsquo;ll share how I used Google URL Builder and some custom Google Analytics code to better track engagement in multichannel campaigns.</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Mini Case Study of a Premerger Facilitation </strong></p><p> We enjoy doing pre-merger facilitations because generally those involved are full of optimism and are looking for ways to make sure they start off strong.  In one recent case where two sole practitioners were merging, we helped the two potential partners examine partnership issues before they formally merged.</p><p> Erik and Alice are each very successful sole practitioners.   They have known each other a long time and frequently meet up at local networking events.  They have even collaborated on a joint client and pitched a very big client together.  So, when each had started thinking about the benefits of being in a partnership, they naturally thought of each other as potential matches.</p><p> Erik thought that Alice was &ldquo;very professional and had demonstrated prior success.&rdquo;  Alice respected Erik&rsquo;s &ldquo;intellect and client service model.&rdquo;  They had been pursuing different &ldquo;model clients&rdquo; but both offered similar services.  But until now, each had been securing and serving clients on their own. How would they transition from being the single point of success/failure for their business to a true collaboration that captures all the benefits of being in an ensemble?</p><p> We provided Alice and Erik with psychometric testing and a facilitated discussion of partnership issues. This allowed them to consider and test potential problems in their partnership before there were any conflicts, while they were still in the honeymoon phase of their merger.</p><p> <strong>  WHAT WAS POSITIVE: </strong>  The assessments revealed that they both had a cooperative and collaborative style. This bodes extremely well for the decisions they will make as they build this new business and allows them to work together for the benefits of their new joint clients.   They agreed that things work best when information is shared early, and they both look forward to getting feedback from each other on proposals and client solutions.</p><p> During the meeting, the expectations of timelines were made fully explicit.  While Erik wants to retire in 10 years, Alice wants to have the option of retiring at that time or continuing.   This information will form the basis of their future discussions and clarify their goals before meeting with their attorneys.  All decisions they make together will be in light of this shared information. </p><p> <strong>  WHAT THEY HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR:   </strong> Both Erik and Alice are gregarious and people-oriented.  Since they enjoy talking and socializing so much, there is the possibility that they will not be as efficient with their joint time together.  We recommend regular scheduled times to discuss the business, but with agendas and time limits. </p><p> Erik scored high in steadiness &ndash; he takes his time in making decisions.  Alice likes to decide quickly.  Now that they know this about each other (and they agreed that this was accurate) they can take that into account instead of getting frustrated with each other&rsquo;s respective styles.   One way to handle this is to agree that decisions would not be made at the meeting where the issue was raised, but at the same time to  have a process for getting decisions made on a timeline.</p><p> Alice scored high in the ability to learn and follow rules, and is naturally detail-oriented.  This lead Erik to assume that Alice would take over billing and bookkeeping, a hated chore.  Alice pointed out that she may be good at these tasks, but she did not love them.  This lead to a discussion of other tasks that had to be divided up and also an acknowledgement that perhaps some tasks had to be outsourced for everyone to be satisfied. </p><p> They were both committed to having a 50/50 split though their current capital and cash flows were unequal. It was clear they needed more discussion around how this inequity may play out over time and what the expectations were in building the combined business.  We provided them with tools to look at the contributions to the partnership in new ways.</p><p> As we prepared the summary of their discussions, we felt that this partnership was off to a great start, not the least because they had devoted time and space to its success, and came away knowing the communication styles and decisions making preferences of their new partner.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written By: Mark C. Taylor</p><p> Sleeker. Faster. More Intuitive\" (The New York Times); \"Welcome to a world where speed is everything\" (Verizon FiOS); \"Speed is God, and time is the devil\" (chief of Hitachi&rsquo;s portable-computer division). In \"real\" time, life speeds up until time itself seems to disappear&mdash;fast is never fast enough, everything has to be done now, instantly. To pause, delay, stop, slow down is to miss an opportunity and to give an edge to a competitor. Speed has become the measure of success&mdash;faster chips, faster computers, faster networks, faster connectivity, faster news, faster communications, faster transactions, faster deals, faster delivery, faster product cycles, faster brains, faster kids. Why are we so obsessed with speed, and why can&rsquo;t we break its spell?</p><p> The cult of speed is a modern phenomenon. In \" <u>  The Futurist Manifesto </u> \" in 1909, Filippo Tommaso Marionetti declared, \"We say that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed.\" The worship of speed reflected and promoted a profound shift in cultural values that occurred with the advent of modernity and modernization. With the emergence of industrial capitalism, the primary values governing life became work, efficiency, utility, productivity, and competition. When Frederick Winslow Taylor took his stopwatch to the factory floor in the early 20th century to increase workers&rsquo; efficiency, he began a high-speed culture of surveillance so memorably depicted in Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;sModern Times. Then, as now, efficiency was measured by the maximization of rapid production through the programming of human behavior.</p><p> With the transition from mechanical to electronic technologies, speed increased significantly. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, and stock ticker liberated communication from the strictures imposed by the physical means of conveyance. Previously, messages could be sent no faster than people, horses, trains, or ships could move. By contrast, immaterial words, sounds, information, and images could be transmitted across great distances at very high speed. During the latter half of the 19th century, railway and shipping companies established transportation networks that became the backbone of national and international information networks. When the trans-Atlantic cable (1858) and transcontinental railroad (1869) were completed, the foundation for the physical infrastructure of today&rsquo;s digital networks was in place.</p><p> Fast-forward 100 years. During the latter half of the 20th century, information, communications, and networking technologies expanded rapidly, and transmission speed increased exponentially. But more than data and information were moving faster. Moore&rsquo;s Law, according to which the speed of computer chips doubles every two years, now seems to apply to life itself. Plugged in 24/7/365, we are constantly struggling to keep up but are always falling further behind. The faster we go, the less time we seem to have. As our lives speed up, stress increases, and anxiety trickles down from managers to workers, and parents to children.</p><p> There is a profound irony in these developments. With the emergence of personal computers and other digital devices in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many analysts predicted a new age in which people would be drawn together in a \"global village,\" where they would be freed from many of the burdens of work and would have ample leisure time to pursue their interests. That was not merely the dream of misty-eyed idealists but was also the prognosis of sober scientists and policy makers. In 1956, Richard Nixon predicted a four-day workweek, and almost a decade later a Senate subcommittee heard expert testimony that by 2000, Americans would be working only 14 hours a week.</p><p> Obviously, things have not turned out that way. Contrary to expectation, the technologies that were supposed to liberate us now enslave us, networks that were supposed to unite us now divide us, and technologies that were supposed to save time leave us no time for ourselves. Henry Ford&rsquo;s adoption of the policy of eight hours of work, eight hours of leisure, eight hours of rest seems a quaint memory of a bygone era. For individuals as well as societies, these developments reflect a significant change in the value and social status of leisure. During the era Thorstein Veblen so vividly described in The Theory of the Leisure Class, social status was measured by how little a person worked; today it is often measured by how much a person works. If you are not constantly connected, you are unimportant; if you willingly unplug to recuperate, play, or even do nothing, you become an expendable slacker.</p><p> Nowhere is the impact of speed more evident than in the world of finance. Since the 1960s, information, media, and communications technologies have given rise to a new form of capitalism. Financial capitalism involves a fundamental change in the way economic value is calculated: not by determining the relation of monetary and financial signs to real commodities, products, or assets like inventory, a factory, or real estate, but rather by their relationship to other financial signs like currencies, options, futures, derivatives, swaps, collateralized mortgage obligations, bitcoins, and countless other so-called financial innovations.</p><p> With the advent of Big Data and high-speed computers and networks, where more than 70 percent of the trades are algorithmically executed in nanoseconds, financial markets no longer function primarily to provide the capital necessary to keep factories running and businesses operating. The virtual economy of Wall Street has been decoupled from the real economy of Main Street. The value of fungible bits is determined by infinitesimal price differences that human beings cannot recognize fast enough to execute trades. Algorithms can program other trading algorithms to adapt on the fly without human intervention.</p><p> Though the importance of high-speed, high-volume trading is widely acknowledged, its political and social implications have not been adequately understood. The much-discussed wealth gap is, in fact, a speed gap.</p><p> In the past 50 years, two economies that operate at two different speeds have emerged. In one, wealth is created by selling labor or stuff; in the other, by trading signs that are signs of other signs. The virtual assets scale at a speed much greater than the real assets. A worker can produce only so many motorcycles, a teacher can teach only so many students, and a doctor can see only so many patients a day. In high-speed markets, by contrast, billions of dollars are won or lost in billionths of a second. In this new world, wealth begets wealth at an unprecedented rate. No matter how many new jobs are created in the real economy, the wealth gap created by the speed gap will never be closed. It will continue to widen at an ever-faster rate until there is a fundamental change in values.</p><p> One of the most basic values that must be rethought is growth, which has not always been the standard by which economic success is measured. The use of the gross national product and gross domestic product to evaluate relative economic performance is largely the product of the Cold War. As the battleground between the United States and the Soviet Union expanded to include the economy, the question became whether capitalism or communism could deliver more goods faster.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/6108-NYC_Library.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> The preoccupation with the rate of growth did not end with the Cold War. In December 2012, Jared Bernstein, former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., concluded a New York Times op-ed entitled \"Raise the Economy&rsquo;s Speed Limit\" by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/opinion/a-slow-growth-rate-is-the-real-threat.html\" target=\"_blank\">   arguing  </a> </u> , \"The first thing to do is to keep applying the accelerator on pro-growth policies that strengthen near-term demand.\"</p><p> There are only three ways markets can expand to keep the economy growing: spatially&mdash;build new factories and open new stores in new places; differentially&mdash;create an endless variety of new products for consumers to buy; and temporally&mdash;accelerate the product cycle. When spatial expansion and differential production reach their limits, the most efficient and effective strategy for promoting growth is to increase the speed of product churn. In fast food, fast fashion, fast networks, and fast markets, time has become money in ways Benjamin Franklin never could have anticipated. The highly touted virtues of innovation and disruption are merely the latest version of Joseph Schumpeter&rsquo;s \"creative destruction,\" which advocated growing the economy by accelerating obsolescence. Out with the old and in with the new, and the faster the better.</p><p> The obsession with speed now borders on the absurd. In the world of high-speed trading, investors in Chicago, for example, can no longer trade on New York markets because of the additional nanoseconds required to transmit buy and sell orders over networks that can never be fast enough. Far from making place irrelevant, speed has made location more important than ever. Financial firms, following a practice known as \"co-location,\" now build facilities for their servers located as close as possible to the servers of the markets on which they trade.</p><p> But speed has limits. As acceleration accelerates, individuals, societies, economies, and even the environment approach meltdown. We have been conned into worshiping speed by an economic system that creates endless desire where there is no need.</p><p> The world that speed continues to create is unsustainable. Contrary to Thomas L. Friedman&rsquo;s insistence that today&rsquo;s high-speed global capitalism creates a flat world whose horizons are infinitely expandable, the world is both literally and figuratively round and, as such, imposes inescapable constraints. On this finite earth, there can no longer be expansion without contraction&mdash;any more than there can be growth without redistribution. When limits are transgressed, the very networks that sustain life are threatened.</p><p> To understand why we are approaching the tipping point, it is necessary to take a systemic approach. Financial capitalism is an example of a general principle for highly connected complex systems. Every such system has, as a condition of its possibility, that which eventually undoes it. In this case, the commitment to the policies of growth that has enabled the U.S. economy to prosper for decades now threatens its collapse. High-speed, high-volume markets have created unprecedented wealth for the .01 percent, but, as the 2008 financial meltdown and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2010/10/what_caused_flash_crash\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2010 Flash Crash  </a> </u>  demonstrate, they have also made the global economy much more volatile.</p><p> The problem is not only, as Michael Lewis argues in Flash Boys, finding a technological fix for markets that are rigged; the problem is that the entire system rests on values that have become distorted: individualism, utility, efficiency, productivity, competition, consumption, and speed. Furthermore, this regime has repressed values that now need to be cultivated: sustainability, community, cooperation, generosity, patience, subtlety, deliberation, reflection, and slowness. If psychological, social, economic, and ecological meltdowns are to be avoided, we need what Nietzsche aptly labeled a \"transvaluation of values.\"</p><p> As a lifelong educator, I would like to think that this process might begin in the classroom. Unfortunately, many of the developments that have changed our economic system have also transformed our educational system. People often ask me how higher education and students have changed in the four decades I have been teaching. While there is no simple answer, the most important changes can be organized under five headings: hyperspecialization, quantification, distraction, acceleration, and vocationalization.</p><p> As I have noted, technologies that were designed to connect us and bring people closer together also create deep social, political, and economic divisions. The proliferation of media outlets has led to mass customization, which allows individuals and isolated groups of individuals to receive personalized news feeds that seal them in bubbles with little knowledge of, or concern about, other points of view. This trend also infects higher education.</p><p> Since the early 1970s, higher education has suffered from increasing specialization and, correspondingly, excessive professionalization. That has created a culture of expertise in which scholars, who know more and more about less and less, spend their professional lives talking to other scholars with similar interests who have little interest in the world around them. This development has led to the increasing fragmentation of disciplines, departments, and curricula. The problem is not only that far too many teachers and students don&rsquo;t connect the dots, they don&rsquo;t even know what dots need to be connected.</p><p> The emergence of the Internet creates the possibility of eroding these barriers and breaking down divisive silos, but the vested interests of nervous administrators and tenured faculty members committed to obsolete ways of organizing knowledge and teaching have blocked that promising prospect. Rather than expanding universes of discourse, networking technologies have, in many cases, narrowed the boundaries of conversation. Dealing with the problems created by a wired world will require a radical restructuring of the educational system at every level.</p><p> The growing concern about the effectiveness of primary, secondary, and postsecondary education has led to a preoccupation with the evaluation of students and teachers. For harried administrators, the fastest and most efficient way to make these assessments is to adopt quantitative methods that have proved most effective in the business world. Measuring inputs, outputs, and throughputs has become the accepted way to calculate educational costs and benefits. While quantitative assessment is effective for some activities and subjects, many of the most important aspects of education cannot be quantified. When people believe that what cannot be measured is not real, education and, by extension society, loses its soul.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s young people are not merely distracted&mdash;the Internet and video games are actually rewiring their brains. Neuroscientists have found significant differences in the brains of \"addicted\" adolescents and \"healthy\" users. The next edition of the standard Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders will very likely specify Internet addiction as an area for further research. The epidemic of ADHD provides additional evidence of the deleterious effects of the excessive use of digital media. Physicians concerned about the inability of their patients to concentrate freely prescribe Ritalin, which is speed, while students staying up all night to study take Ritalin to give them a competitive advantage.</p><p> Rather than resisting these pressures, anxious parents exacerbate them by programming their kids for what they believe will be success from the time they are in prekindergarten. But the knowledge that matters cannot be programmed, and creativity cannot be rushed but must be cultivated slowly and patiently. As leading scientists, writers, and artists have long insisted, the most imaginative ideas often emerge in moments of idleness.</p><p> Many people lament the fact that young people do not read or write as much as they once did. But that is wrong&mdash;the issue is not how much they are reading and writing; indeed they are, arguably, reading and writing more than ever before. The problem is how they are reading and what they are writing. There is a growing body of evidence that people read and write differently online. Once again the crucial variable is speed. The claim that faster is always better is nowhere more questionable than when reading, writing, and thinking.</p><p> All too often, online reading resembles rapid information processing rather than slow, careful, deliberate reflection. Researchers have discovered what they describe as an \"F-shaped pattern\" for reading web content, in which as people read down a page, they scan fewer and fewer words in a line. When speed is essential, the shorter, the better; complexity gives way to simplicity, and depth of meaning is dissipated in surfaces over which fickle eyes surf. Fragmentary emails, flashy websites, tweets in 140 characters or less, unedited blogs filled with mistakes. Obscurity, ambiguity, and uncertainty, which are the lifeblood of art, literature, and philosophy, become decoding problems to be resolved by the reductive either/or of digital logic.</p><p> Finally, vocationalization. With the skyrocketing cost of college, parents, students, and politicians have become understandably concerned about the utility of higher education. Will college prepare students for tomorrow&rsquo;s workplace? Which major will help get a job? Administrators and admission officers defend the value of higher education in economic terms by citing the increased lifetime earning potential for college graduates. While financial matters are not unimportant, value cannot be measured in economic terms alone. The preoccupation with what seems to be practical and useful in the marketplace has led to a decline in the perceived value of the arts and humanities, which many people now regard as impractical luxuries.</p><p> That development reflects a serious misunderstanding of what is practical and impractical, as well as the confusion between the practical and the vocational. As the American Academy of Arts and Sciences report on the humanities and social sciences,  <a href=\"http://www.humanitiescommission.org/_pdf/hss_report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  \"  <u>   The Heart of the Matter  </u>  ,\" </a>  insists, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/HumanitiesSocial-Sciences/139899/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   humanities and liberal arts have never been more important  </a> </u>  than in today&rsquo;s globalized world. Education focused on STEM disciplines is not enough&mdash;to survive and perhaps even thrive in the 21st century, students need to study religion, philosophy, art, languages, literature, and history. Young people must learn that memory cannot be outsourced to machines, and short-term solutions to long-term problems are never enough. Above all, educators are responsible for teaching students how to think critically and creatively about the values that guide their lives and inform society as a whole.</p><p> That cannot be done quickly&mdash;it will take the time that too many people think they do not have.</p><p> Acceleration is unsustainable. Eventually, speed kills. The slowing down required to delay or even avoid the implosion of interrelated systems that sustain our lives does not merely involve pausing to smell the roses or taking more time with one&rsquo;s family, though those are important.</p><p> Within the long arc of history, it becomes clear that the obsession with speed is a recent development that reflects values that have become destructive. Not all reality is virtual, and the quick might not inherit the earth. Complex systems are not infinitely adaptive, and when they collapse, it happens suddenly and usually unexpectedly. Time is quickly running out.</p>",

    "title": "4 Tips For Making Your Holiday Parties Profitable!",
    "link": "4-tips-for-making-your-holiday-parties-profitable",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s that time of year again! Time for the annual company or neighborhood holiday party and all the other social events that come with the holiday season. The truth is that these seasonal events are also a great place for networking. And even if you don&rsquo;t look at them as &lsquo;networking events,&rsquo; you likely will be meeting new people and making an impression in the process. You may as well make the most of it! <br/> <br/> <strong>  Here are four easy tips for maximizing your interactions at holiday parties this year: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Have a plan of action before you go. </strong>  If you can, find out in advance who will be attending the event. Do some research online and on social networking sites like LinkedIn to learn about attendees and give yourself some connection points with these individuals. (You may even want to consider asking the host for a guest list.) Pick five people that you definitely want to talk to while you are there, and don&rsquo;t avoid the big names. Challenge yourself by making an effort to connect with the most powerful person in the room.</p><p> <strong>  2. Let them do the talking (you ask the questions)!   </strong> As you meet new people this holiday season, be sure to have more in your arsenal than small talk. But instead of worrying about what you will say &ndash; just be ready to ask good questions and listen. Here are a few to get the conversation going:</p><li> Where will you be spending the holidays?</li><li> Where did you grow up? Do you still have family there? </li><li> What are your children up to this holiday season? What gifts are they asking for? <br/>  </li><p> Once the conversation is flowing freely, ask questions that lead to definitive answers:</p><li> What&rsquo;s the best thing that has happened to your business this year?</li><li> What&rsquo;s your biggest challenge? </li><li> What do you find is the most effective way to keep a client happy? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3. Be prepared to describe yourself in fifteen seconds.  </strong> It&rsquo;s no doubt that you have a lot of qualifications and experience. So much that you could probably go on for hours about yourself. But the hard reality is that most people would rather talk about themselves more than listen to you. When you&rsquo;re meeting new people at this season&rsquo;s holiday parties, resist the urge to give them a ten minute introduction about yourself. Instead, prepare a short, fifteen second description that hits on a few memorable points. Think about what&rsquo;s unique about what you have done and what will be remembered in a room full of people.</p><p> <strong>  4. The party may end, but your connection shouldn&rsquo;t. </strong>   Following an event - be proactive. Spend ten minutes cementing your connections by entering people into your database. Include reminders to yourself of interesting or remarkable things people said so that you won&rsquo;t forget them and can refer back to them in later conversations. And be sure to use social media to keep in touch. Invite people you&rsquo;ve met to connect with you on LinkedIn or other social networking sites and share something the person said to you at the event that you remember to make it personal. And if you can, give them a referral. You will start connections that may turn out to be the best gifts you can give <strong>  YOURSELF </strong> this season.</p>",

Risk-aversion is a common tactic that substitutes deliberate ignorance for thoughtful planning.</p><p> A leader&rsquo;s ability to make their own luck is closely woven into their ability to take smart risks, and their ability to take smart risks has a profound impact on happiness and life satisfaction. </p><p> The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark&mdash;Michelangelo</p><p> Here are 3 smart ways you can embrace risk and find true success:</p><p> <strong>  1. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT FEELINGS </strong></p><p> Smart leaders embrace risk by listening to what their gut instinct is telling them.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Damasio\" target=\"_blank\">   Research  </a> </u>  at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_and_Creativity_Institute\" target=\"_blank\">   Brain and Creativity Institute  </a> </u>  has shown that gut-thinking is a good idea because there is a relationship between emotions, rational thinking, and our physical body. When we&rsquo;ve accurately processed our emotions, they often accelerate our decision making process in the form of intuitions, hunches, and gut feelings.</p><p> For example, your brain can predict an outcome based on your perceptions (outside information) and your emotions (inside information). This combination of information results in a physical sensation&mdash;a gut feeling.</p><p> The quicker we get in touch with our emotions, the quicker we make our decisions. A good rule of thumb is not to just remember facts about past situations and their subsequent outcome&mdash;but also recall how you felt at the time.</p><p> Associating fact and emotion is critical to cultivating intuition, hunches, and gut feelings.</p><p> <strong>  2. TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR BRAIN </strong></p><p> Smart leaders embrace risk by rewiring their brain to learn new skills.</p><p> Until recently, the brain was regarded as an immutable organ that did not change after early childhood.</p><p> Researchers  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Merzenich\" target=\"_blank\">   Mike Merzenich  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.normandoidge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Norman Doidge  </a> </u>  have demonstrated that the brain has the ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections&mdash;and this continues throughout life.</p><p> When we are faced with risk, we no longer need to revert to the same negative feelings that we once felt. If we take charge of our brain, we can train it to change its response to new situations and changes in our environment. </p><p> We are no longer captive to the way we once thought about risk. Our memories, behaviors, responses, and habits are not our destiny! We have more control over the way our brain thinks than we once believed.</p><p> <strong>  3. CHANGE THE WAY YOUR BRAIN LOOKS AT RISK </strong></p><p> Smart leaders embrace risk by changing their brain to look at risk differently.</p><p> You can do this by focusing your attention on the things in life that are most important. Wherever your attention goes, energy follows.</p><p> Most importantly, what comes to the attention of your brain also molds your way of thinking. Mental toughness is controlling your thoughts to get the results you are after.</p><p> Start by intentionally noticing where your attention is at any given moment. Follow these 3 steps:</p><li> What is happening in your body at that same moment? Are you feeling calm or a sense of panic?</li><li> What is it about where your attention is focused that makes you feel this way? Is it a thought from your past that keeps playing in your head like a broken record? Or, is it exactly where you want to be?</li><li> What do you need to do to shift your attention in a different direction?</li><p> Since we now know that the brain is constantly seeking stimulation and rewards, it&rsquo;s easier to understand how our fear of risk and avoidance of failure impacts what captures our attention. </p><p> A continuous molding of the brain is essential to knowing how to take smart risks. As with any skill, the more you practice and do it, the more natural it becomes.</p><p> Smart risk-taking can become a habit, like anything else. The simple practice of noticing where our attention is and bringing it back to where we want it to be plays a vital role in rewiring the way our brain looks at risk and uncertainty. </p><p> By repeating the three steps above, you will begin to develop the habits necessary to take small, smart risks. Once we identify habits that add value to our decision-making process, we can take a closer look at the ones we struggle with, and the ones that are holding us back from having the life we want.</p><p> The risk not taken is the opportunity lost&mdash;LaRae Quy</p><p> What risks have you taken that have brought you satisfaction in life and business?</p>",

    "content": "<p> While assessing an advisory firm&rsquo;s technology needs, I was told to &ldquo;push the envelope&rdquo; with Excel&rsquo;s capabilities so the firm didn&rsquo;t have to invest in other software. As a consultant, it was not difficult for me to respond. As an employee, I may not have had the opportunity to respond.</p><p> When it comes to technology, it seems that making no decision is the number one reason employees are frustrated. The excuses given for no decision just adds to the frustration levels.</p><p> But you invested in technology and your staff is still frustrated. This doesn&rsquo;t make sense. With more technology options for every area of your business, you anticipated technology to eliminate, or reduce your firm&rsquo;s frustration levels.</p><p> While your staff appreciates your investment in technology, not all of your decisions are welcomed. Here are scenarios that can drive your staff crazy:</p><p> Under-estimating the complexity of your client base when selecting software &ndash; Not understanding the intricacies behind each client may lead your firm to select technology that will meet only half of your needs.</p><p> And leaving your staff to deal with the other half &ndash; For areas that aren&rsquo;t supported by your technology, you delegate the &ldquo;figure-it-out-and-make-it-work&rdquo; process to your staff, which they eventually resolve.</p><p> Implementing work-flow processes that don&rsquo;t work &ndash;You feel obligated to conform to the work-flow templates provided by the software. The templates contain steps that your staff believes are unnecessary and will create bottlenecks in the process. Your staff understands the importance of efficiency and may end up ignoring those tasks.</p><p> Insisting on the same reports as the previous software &ndash; Without a plan on how the firm will use the technology, your clients receive the same reports as with the old system, via the same snail-mail method.</p><p> Making decisions with limited technology knowledge &ndash; Has anyone in your firm ever agreed to a client request while not certain if the technology can deliver? Or, attempt to develop a complex rebalancing model without understanding the relationships of the variables used in the software?</p><p> Returning from a tech conference with grandiose ideas and nothing else&ndash;Your firm&rsquo;s representative returns with excitement over products the firm doesn&rsquo;t need, or with great ideas that don&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p><p> Think &ldquo;organized thought processes&rdquo;, not &ldquo;excessive work-flow processes&rdquo; </p><p> Creating a technology environment that pleases everyone in your firm is not a difficult process. But it does take an organized process and involves your staff. The following are several tips to help ease the frustrations listed above:</p><li> If you are willing to upgrade to new software, define the required level of support the software needs to maintain. For example, if the rebalancing software needs to support at least 90% of your clients, define those features that must be included in the software. This will minimize the exception items your staff will have to deal with.</li><li> If you recently implemented new software, another conversion is probably not an option. There are alternatives you can analyze ranging from vendor assistance to more sophisticated solutions provided by custom software developers.</li><li> Outline areas of your firm that can best be served by new technology. This will help you focus on the right areas at the next tech conference. Also, make sure the appropriate person attends the conference. It may benefit your firm if a staff person that works closely with your technology attends a conference and can visualize how new products will fit in with your existing structure.</li><li> Develop a plan on servicing clients using the technology. Commit to a timeline for rolling out the technology to your clients.</li><p> Let your staff appreciate your investment and your decisions.</p>",

I personally feel embarrassed and my ankle probably hurts though I&rsquo;m too stubborn to act like it.</p><p> If I were to pause and think about it (instead of doing my awkward &ldquo;I must have tripped on something&rdquo; look and running out of there) what would those feelings telling me?</p><li> That I&rsquo;m self-conscious.</li><li> That I&rsquo;m distracted and not present.</li><li> That I should probably walk more carefully.</li><p> And while those are valuable pieces of information to remember, we often get stuck using those unprocessed feelings to shape our beliefs about ourselves. There&rsquo;s a big difference between:</p><li> Calling that incident a mild embarrassment  </li><li> Holding onto shame and defining myself as a clumsy indiot</li><p> So how do you avoid doing this?</p><p> Learn to label.</p><p> The better you are at labeling an emotion, the more self-awareness you&rsquo;ll have.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a big difference between saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad&rdquo; and going into self-pity mode and saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m resentful toward her. I feel anger, shame and guilt.&rdquo; Why does upping your emotional vocab matter? It allows us to move away from seeing the world in black and white. It allows us to see that emotions can coexist, making us happier and improving our self-concept.</p><p> <strong>  So here&rsquo;s my challenge to you: </strong></p><p> Get over your need to be comfortable all the time. When you feel something come up, feel it, label it, decode it, and let it go. Or you can hold onto it and implode like a black hole of sorrow, filling your home with tchotchkes, cats, and used tissues.</p><p> The choice is yours.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What You Need to Know </strong></p><p> The fourth most common compliance deficiency for RIA firms involves the creation, delivery and enforcement of the firm&rsquo;s privacy policy.  <br/> <br/> All RIAs must have a privacy policy in place that outlines how they protect their clients&rsquo; confidential information. Advisors are expected to include the following in their privacy policy: </p><li> What information is collected from clients;</li><li> What sources that information is collected from (over and above information provided by the client);</li><li> The firm&rsquo;s basis for sharing this information;</li><li> What safeguards you have in place to protect client information; and</li><li> Any state-specific privacy regulations the firm is subject to.</li><p> This privacy policy must be distributed to all new clients, as well as all ongoing clients on an annual basis. Any subsequent changes to the privacy policy necessitates an additional delivery to clients as well.</p><p> <strong>  Why You Should Care </strong></p><p> Identify theft, cyber fraud and high profile security breaches have become common occurrences. The media attention they receive has undoubtably heightened your clients' sensitivity to protecting their personal information.  <br/> <br/> Your privacy policy can become a very compelling relationship management tool, as it serves as a proof statement to clients that you respect and guard their information. Likewise, it should be used internally to lay out for your employees some simple protocols to guide their decisions when handling confidential client information. <br/> <br/> As a general policy, supervised persons should not release confidential client information without first consulting with the CCO. This mitigates your regulatory risk by ensuring that nonpublic information is disclosed only to the extent it is needed to conduct business for that client.</p><p> <strong>  Our Recommendations </strong></p><p> To ensure that your firm is keeping up with regulatory requirements and industry best practices in this area:</p><li> Provide a copy of your firm&rsquo;s privacy policy to new clients along with your investment advisory agreement and Form ADV Part 2. (Since Form ADV Part 2 and the privacy policy follow similar delivery rules, we usually recommend combining these two documents.)</li><li> Deliver a copy of your privacy policy to all clients at least annually.</li><li> Confirm that your investment advisory agreements contain an acknowledgement of receipt of your privacy policy.</li><li> Train your staff on the content, purpose and importance of your firm&rsquo;s privacy policy.</li>",

As my mom used to say &ndash; and my wife will no doubt soon echo &ndash; &ldquo;If everyone jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you?&rdquo;</p><p> Children actually aren&rsquo;t the only ones who risk succumbing to peer pressure. Psychologists have found investors do it all the time. In that case, the behavioral bias is called &ldquo;herding.&rdquo; It goes a long way toward explaining why investors tend to prefer investment options that are popular &ndash;  <u>  like 5-star funds, which tend to attract a disproportionate amount of investment dollars </u> .</p><p> The rationale is based on our hard-wired perception of safety in numbers. Since &ldquo;everyone else&rdquo; is buying the 5-star fund, the typical investor feels comfortable joining the herd, even if that investment option may not be suitable for them personally.</p><p> <strong>  Quantifying the cost of herding </strong></p><p> What does this behavioral bias cost the typical investor? A substantial amount, according to a Russell study that compares the return of the Russell 3000&reg; Index and the return earned by the &ldquo;average&rdquo; investor1 between 1984 and 2013.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1-High-cost-investor-behavior.jpg\" width=\"561\"/></p><br/>(1) BNY Mellon Analytical Services, Russell 3000&reg; Index annualized return from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 2013.<br/>(2) Russell Investment Group, Strategas &amp; Investment Company Institute (ICI). Return was calculated by deriving the internal rate of return (IRR) based on ICI monthly fund flow data which was compared to the rate of return if invested in the Russell 3000&reg; Index and held without alteration from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 2013. This seeks to illustrate how regularly increasing or decreasing equity exposure based on the current market trends can sacrifice even market like returns.<br/>Indexes and/or benchmarks are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly. Returns represent past performance, are not a guarantee of future performance, and are not indicative of any specific investment.<p> <br/> During that 30-year time period, the Index had an average return of 11% per year. In contrast, the typical investor&rsquo;s return was only 8.8% on average per year. That average 2.2% difference in returns per year between the Index and the typical investor amounts to a cumulative difference of $103,358 on a $10,000 investment. ($10,000 invested in the Russell 3000&reg; Index during that time period would have grown to $228,923, whereas the average investor&rsquo;s $10,000 would only have grown to $125,564).</p><p> That&rsquo;s not chump change!</p><p> <strong>  The bottom line </strong></p><p> How can you help prevent your clients from engaging in this reckless behavior &ndash; especially around the turn of the year, when many investors typically review their portfolios? Emphasize the value of taking a disciplined, long-term approach to investing that is grounded by conviction. Help your client develop a plan that is tailored to their unique situation.</p><br/>1 Represented by an investor who invested in the Russell 3000&reg; Index between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 2013 using the net flow patterns of actual U.S. equity mutual fund investors tracked by the Investment Company Institute.<br/>The Russell 3000&reg; Index measures the performance of the largest 3000 U.S. companies representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market.<br/>Indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.",

    "content": "<p> Numerous studies have demonstrated that it is not our circumstances that cause us stress but rather our perception of these events and our ability to adapt to them. Many people experience stress in the midst of positive situations because they&rsquo;re not taking care of their needs adequately, as can happen when we go too long without eating or find ourselves with sleep deprivation. Our energy is not a limitless resource, but fortunately we can replenish it through consistent recovery strategies.</p><p> One of the primary challenges with energy management is that we fail to pay attention to our energy status throughout the day. We may receive gentle messages from our physical, mental or emotional systems telling us we&rsquo;re running out of energy through symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, lack of focus, impatience, frustration or anxiety. Even when we try to be more aware, our perception can be skewed by stress hormones and artificial energy sources such as caffeine that make us feel as if we can keep going for hours without stopping to refill the tank.</p><p> So many people experience these warning signs on a regular basis that they quickly become perceived as normal, with the system experiencing internal wear and tear over longer periods of time until the signal is finally too loud to ignore. Heart attacks, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune disease, digestive problems, insomnia, chronic headaches and weight gain are just a sample of consequences that occur as a result of long-term energy imbalances; all of which cause unnecessary stress to the system. But the cause of the stress wasn&rsquo;t initially the illnesses or diseases but rather the original imbalance that was ignored over time.</p><p> We ignore our signals of imbalance for many reasons; more often than not because we&rsquo;re doing what we believe is the right thing to do &ndash; serving our children, our co-workers, our direct reports, our bosses, our spouses, our communities. We regularly sacrifice our needs for the sake of others, justifying it by either convincing ourselves that it&rsquo;s short term (until the kids grow up, the project is finished, we have enough financing to hire some help, etc) or telling ourselves the story that it&rsquo;s best to sacrifice our needs for the sake of the greater good.</p><p> However, how much help can we really be to others when we have no energy left to give? As the flight attendant always says, you must put your oxygen mask on first before helping others. It&rsquo;s not selfish to make sure you have oxygen &ndash; you can&rsquo;t help anyone if you can&rsquo;t breathe! </p>",

Trusts can help ensure multigenerational client retention. When a client dies their account is generally moved within six months (if there isn&rsquo;t an advisor-friendly trustee on the team before death). Why? The next generation has no connection with their parents&rsquo; advisors. They have their own trusted relationships and they choose to take their money elsewhere. Unless you really enjoy prospecting this is a scary realization. You have already prospected them once, now let&rsquo;s maintain that relationship through the next generation. Utilizing an advisor-friendly trust company as trustee on your clients&rsquo; trust ensures you manage the assets for more than one generation.</p><p> <strong>  Four: </strong> A book of business with trust accounts and an advisor friendly trustee creates a stronger long term revenue stream, and can make your business worth up to 40 percent more when you plan on selling it. Inevitably you will perpetuate your business, whether you sell it or transition it to another advisor. You can&rsquo;t expect top dollar if you don&rsquo;t plan. Work with an advisor friendly trust company to make sure your practice is worth all the hard work you put into it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Two times more widows than widowers say their spouse&rsquo;s death carried significant negative financial consequences during the first year after their loss.</p><p> This sharp contrast recurred in numerous financial questions recently posed to widows and widowers by New York Life.  The contrast also seemed to persist across various income levels, in questions revolving around both essential needs and luxuries.  Here&rsquo;s a sampling of answers given by nearly 900 Americans whose spouses have died sometime in the past decade:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/chart1.jpg\" width=\"534\"/></p><p> Their answers beg the question: Why the divergence?</p><p> One reason is certainly that two-thirds of the widows surveyed reported their income was under $35,000, while a majority of the widowers earned more than that. Adults over age 18 were  <u>  canvassed </u> , so working women&rsquo;s lower earnings no doubt contributed to the income and lifestyle disparities.</p><p> Pension survivor policies also play a role, since two out of three of the people surveyed were over age 65.</p><p> Consider Social Security.  If the person who died was receiving the larger of the two Social Security checks coming into an older couple&rsquo;s house, the surviving spouse will now receive that larger benefit.  But the death of a spouse also reduces the household&rsquo;s Social Security checks every month from two to one.  This happens both to newly widowed men and women, but the women, who typically live longer than men and tend to be younger than their husbands, are more often the ones who must adjust to paying for the fixed household expenses with a single check.</p><p> Widows may also lose out under defined benefit (DB) pension plans for two reasons: because men historically were somewhat more likely to have a DB pension, and because women usually out-live their husbands.  A man&rsquo;s full pension will continue if his wife dies first.  But if he dies first, the surviving wife&rsquo;s pension may shrink dramatically.</p><p> Under  <u>  federal law </u> , the default survivor benefit in a DB plan must equal at least half of the worker&rsquo;s benefit; the worker and his spouse can change it only if they both agree.  But if the couple accepts the default, &ldquo;the benefit might be $1,300 a month while your spouse is alive. However, when he dies, your benefit would be $650 a month for as long as you live,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wiserwomen.org/index.php?id=280&amp;page=Why_You_and_Your_Spouse_Need_to_Know_About_\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   warns  </a> </u>  the Women&rsquo;s Institute for a Secure Retirement.</p><p> Women should anticipate and plan for these financial risks.</p><p> Learn more <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   <strong>    here   </strong>  </u> </a> . </p>",

They evidence an understanding that water clearly does not just come from the tap. (As both an environmental scientist and a mother, I can say that the reason that there are so many  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.the-best-childrens-books.org/water-cycle-for-kids.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   children&rsquo;s books on the water cycle  </a> </u>  is that it is not intuitive &mdash; and needs to be explained.) Water is part of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/circ1139/htdocs/natural_processes_of_ground.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   hydrologic cycle  </a> </u>  and watershed-based hydrological systems that functions differently depending on the local geology, plants and trees, soils, rainfall, weather and climate, as well as the diversions put in place &mdash; and other factors. Untangling hydrological systems can surface the proverbial spaghetti plate of complicated systems mapping, that either overwhelms or bores most people.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/watercyclesummary.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> The hydrologic cycle is complicated enough that the USGS offers learning materials for \"kids ages 5-95.\"</p><p> The trick for business people is to step back. Understand both the parts and the whole of the system. Scrutinize how both hydrological and business systems can be optimized through innovations (or undercut by specific practices). You can undertake immediate efforts to invest in decreasing water waste and increasing water efficiencies, as well as improve overall system function (including the functioning of  <u>  <a href=\"http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/handbook_index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">   watersheds through restoration  </a> </u> ). Then, determine where and when to invest in R&amp;D.</p><p> This work should seek to innovative solutions to problems \"outside\" of the system, such as using less water (or no water) for production processes, considered from a full  <u>  life cycle perspective </u>  and leveraging insights from  <u>  <a href=\"http://biomimicry.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   biomimicry  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Be alert to possible answers </strong></p><p> Throughout all of these tasks, it is useful to assess corporate facilities and key supply chain partners in their \"native habitat\" &mdash; which gets super-fun. It gets you out into green walled offices with good oxygen. It can make you think more creatively. It makes you realize that you may not be able to use engineering to solve all water problems.</p><p> \"Green infrastructure\" may well be a significant part of the solution &mdash; potentially within a blended model. It is notable that proponents of a \"gray/green\" approach to corporate resilience now include Royal Dutch Shell, the Dow Chemical Company, Unilever and SwissRe, as laid out in a recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/about-us/working-with-companies/companies-we-work-with/building-a-case-for-green-infrastructure.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   report  </a> </u>  these companies created along with the Nature Conservancy and a resiliency expert.</p><p> As you consider corporate water risk and opportunity, think like an aikido master. How can you anticipate and avoid impacts through redirection? Think like  <u>  <a href=\"https://bfi.org/about-fuller/biography\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   R. Buckminister Fuller  </a> </u>  and innovate solutions. And think like Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, who said: \"Somebody has to do something, and it's just incredibly pathetic that it has to be us.\"</p><p> It has to be all of us. But it&rsquo;ll be fun. And it&rsquo;ll get our creative juices flowing.</p> ",

In February, Social@Ogilvy reported that organic reach for Facebook pages with over 500,000 Likes had dropped to just 2%. The agency argued that businesses were rapidly approaching a watershed moment they called Facebook Zero, the point when organic reach becomes nonexistent.</p><p> Marketers have had to reconsider how Facebook fits into the mix of paid, owned, and earned media. When organic reach was high, brands could treat their Facebook pages as &ldquo;owned&rdquo; media, but those days are over. Look for 2015 to be the year of paid social media, as brands and publishers increasingly use promoted posts and social ads to reach audiences on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p> <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/why-it-might-be-time-to-completely-change-your-social-media-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Why It Might Be Time to Completely Change Your Social Media Strategy   </a>  </strong> </u></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaybaer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jay Baer  </a> </u>  at Convince &amp; Convert</p><p> Jay Baer offers a controversial solution to what he calls the &ldquo;Reachpocalypse&rdquo; on Facebook and social media in general. He argues that the decline of organic reach on social media requires marketers to adopt a &ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; strategy, which involves sending more messages in more places. His suggested approach emphasizes quantity over quality, which sounds like blasphemy to most social media professionals and content marketers.</p><p> But the key to Baer&rsquo;s strategy is to connect with each fan in as many social channels as possible, rather than building up a massive audience in one place. According to Baer, the most important metric for social media marketers is now the average number of connections per fan. Whether you&rsquo;re inclined to agree, Baer addresses issues that will be critical to social media strategy in 2015. Facebook might be the first social network to reduce organic reach, but it definitely won&rsquo;t be the last.</p><p> <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/09/23/ryan-holmes-why-twitter-facebook-and-apple-suddenly-want-to-handle-your-money/\" target=\"_blank\">    Why Twitter and Facebook Suddenly Want to Handle Your Money   </a>  </strong> </u></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/invoker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ryan Holmes  </a> </u>  at The Wall Street Journal</p><p> In this piece for the Wall Street Journal, Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes explains why the introduction of &ldquo;buy&rdquo; buttons in Twitter and Facebook is just the tip of the iceberg for payment technology in social media. For now, the social networks are still experimenting with ecommerce and finding out how to bring one-click payments into your streams. But what happens if Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks get tired of being the middlemen for the credit card companies and other payment processors? Credit card interchange fees represent a $40 billion industry in the U.S. alone, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if the biggest social networking sites start looking for a slice of that pie.</p><p> The social payments ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly. Less than two months after Holmes&rsquo; article was published, Snapchat announced Snapcash, a partnership with Square that allows its users to send money directly to friends.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/21/5307992/inside-the-mind-of-a-fanboy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Fanboys: Have you ever loved something so much it hurt?   </a>  </u> </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lessleyanderson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lessley Anderson  </a> </u>  at The Verge</p><p> Why are fanboys so maniacally loyal to their favorite brands? And what compels them to write hateful, insulting Tweets about their rivals? To find out, Lessley Anderson interviews several fanboys who are on the front lines of the most vicious flamewar of them all: the three-way struggle for smartphone supremacy between Google, Apple, and Microsoft devotees. She discovers that every fanboy is unique, like a precious, angry snowflake. The path from casual fan to obsessive zealot turns out to be a highly personal experience.</p><p> However, the article also suggests that most of us have more in common with fanboys than we might readily admit. Whether it&rsquo;s religion, politics, or a sports team, we use social media to rally around a common interest with like-minded people. It&rsquo;s easy to get trapped inside an echo chamber, where all conflicting views are filtered out. Anderson&rsquo;s revealing look at fanboys is a cautionary reminder that social media should broaden your perspective, not close it.</p><p> <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/08/i-liked-everything-i-saw-on-facebook-for-two-days-heres-what-it-did-to-me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    I Liked Everything I Saw on Facebook for Two Days.

The results are hilarious, horrifying, and illuminating. &ldquo;By liking everything,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I turned Facebook into a place where there was nothing I liked.&rdquo;</p><p> <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"https://medium.com/matter/buzzfeeds-jonah-peretti-goes-long-e98cf13160e7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    BuzzFeed&rsquo;s Jonah Peretti Goes Long   </a>  </strong> </u></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felixsalmon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Felix Salmon  </a> </u>  at Medium</p><p> When it comes to viral media, nobody does it better than Buzzfeed. The site has not only mastered the art of the &ldquo;listicle&rdquo;, the overwhelmingly popular article format you&rsquo;re reading right now, but the powerful psychology of identity and relatedness that inspires people to click (and share) content. In an epic interview with Felix Salmon at Medium, Buzzfeed founder Jonah Peretti shares his thoughts on a broad range of topics, including network theory, experimentation in the media industry, and his experience at the Huffington Post before he moved on to Buzzfeed. It&rsquo;s a dense, thoughtful, and very long read, which is ironic considering Peretti&rsquo;s predilection for bite-sized content. However, it&rsquo;s well worth your time if you&rsquo;re in the business of sharing.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"https://medium.com/message/what-is-public-f33b16d780f9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    What Is Public?   </a>  </u> </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anildash\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Anil Dash  </a> </u>  at Medium</p><p> In this thought-provoking essay, Anil Dash takes issue with publishers and technologists who believe any social media message that is not explicitly private is fair game to share without consent. Dash regrets that &ldquo;there is no apparent debate over whether it&rsquo;s any different to embed a tweet from the President of the United States or from a vulnerable young activist who might not have anticipated her words being attached to her real identity, where she can be targeted by anonymous harassers.&rdquo;</p><p> According to Dash, most human behaviour is &ldquo;neither clearly public nor strictly private&rdquo;, but something in between. He challenges us to create a more nuanced definition of &ldquo;public&rdquo; that better reflects the world we live in. In his view, journalists and bloggers have an ethical obligation to consider the consequences of broadcasting someone&rsquo;s semi-public words to a massive audience. His essay is a must-read for anyone who has embedded a Tweet in a blog post or article.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://digiday.com/platforms/facbeook-twitter-ferguson/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Why Facebook is for ice buckets, Twitter is for Ferguson   </a>  </u> </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnpmcdermott\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John McDermott  </a> </u>  at Digiday</p><p> In early August, social media in the United States was taken over by two simultaneous sensations: the Ice Bucket Challenge, and the events in Ferguson, Missouri. Yet as John McDermott shows, each story played out very differently on Facebook and Twitter. You may recall that your Facebook feed was practically drowning in ice water at the height of the trend, while nearly everyone in your Twitter feed was embroiled in the Ferguson controversy.</p><p> In 2014, Facebook and Twitter became  <a href=\"http://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-profile-redesign/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  increasingly similar in form </a>  (just look at your feeds side by side), but this episode demonstrates that they remain far apart in function. For the time being, Facebook is primarily a place where people like to connect with friends and family, share photos and videos, and relax. Its algorithmically curated News Feed does a great job of surfacing highly engaging content, but can&rsquo;t match Twitter for real time discussion around breaking news stories. In the year ahead, we may see the two networks converge further, as Facebook tweaks its service to become more of a news provider and Twitter considers using algorithms to curate your timeline. Stay tuned.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/this-guy-is-creating-a-facebook-for-rich-people-917\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    There&rsquo;s a Social Network That Costs $9,000 to Join   </a>  </u> </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jules_su\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jules Suzdaltsev  </a> </u>  at VICE</p><p> Netropolitan, a social network for the 1%, is betting that wealthy individuals can&rsquo;t wait to socialize online about a common interest: money. It operates like a country club, with an upfront lifetime membership cost of $9,000 plus a recurring annual fee of $3,000. Jules Suzdaltsev of VICE interviewed Netropolitan&rsquo;s founder, James Touchi-Peters, to find out how the site works, why it exists, and if socialites really need to be any more social. The interview touches on several key issues that every new social network must deal with, including security, privacy, content guidelines, and yes, monetization.</p><p> Many specialized networks based on common interests have cropped up over the years, with varying degrees of success. Some are still going strong, such as <a href=\"http://www.sermo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SERMO </a> , the social network for physicians. Many others haven&rsquo;t fared so well. A recent example is ReaganBook, a social network for American political conservatives that was  <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5952725/reaganbook-conservative-facebook-trolls\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  shut down </a>  shortly after launch. And who can forget HAMSTERster, the now-defunct social network for pet hamsters? It remains to be seen whether Netropolitan&rsquo;s business model will help it succeed where others have been left spinning their wheels.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Have You Got That Leadership Thing Nailed? </strong></p><p> The books, the articles, the interviews, the seemingly endless stream of #leadership posts&hellip; and they are seemingly endless&hellip;. &ldquo;Have a vision!&rdquo; &ldquo;Shape a culture!&rdquo; &ldquo;Empower your people!&rdquo; The leadership paradigm is frequently cast as leader vs. manager - leaders are awesome and 'managers' are pathetic, incompetent, or both, pathetically incompetent.</p><p> <strong>  The Leadership Test </strong></p><p> The problem with framing the question as leader vs. manager is that it misses the fundamental paradox of leadership itself. One can practice leadership. One can strive to be a leader. But one can&rsquo;t be or become the leader you wish to be without people willing to follow you. Why? Because, if the people following you are only doing so because they have no choice, then they aren&rsquo;t followers at all &ndash; they are hostages (or worse, slaves) doing what hostages do - following orders so as to protect themselves while they seek the first opportunity to escape.</p><p> <strong>  The Follower Makes The Leader </strong></p><p> Do your people believe that you&rsquo;re a visionary or a moron? Do they think you have a plan or that you're just blindly stumbling? Do they feel that you respect and believe in them???Leadership can&rsquo;t be learned from a list. Or validated in a mirror. Being in charge is easy - just tell people what to do. But if you want to become the leader you want to be, or simply an effective manager (which really isn't as bad as all that), you must learn from those inclined to follow you. What are they thinking? Where are their heads at? What would motivate, inspire and drive them to want to follow you? Trust me when I say that those who work for you have answers for all of these questions. If you don't know what their answers would be, you run the risk that your view of your leadership quality may be asynchronous with theirs.</p><p> <strong>  A Simple Leadership Exercise </strong></p><p> So here&rsquo;s a fun exercise you can do the next time you see one of those leader vs. manager posts circulating on LinkedIn &ndash; and I assure you, you will see one. Show it to those beholden and/or dependent upon you. But, rather than asking them whether they think you meet the criteria shown, hostages will say anything to appease their captors, instead ask them what they think your vision is, or how they feel you empower them, or if they're considering jumping ship at the first opportunity... Do this for every question on that leadership list that you find so inspiring. Their answers may be hard to hear, and you may vehemently disagree with the positions and views stated. But if you are willing to listen, you might just discover where you fall on the Leader vs. Manger spectrum. Heck, you may even find you're closer to your aspiration than you know!</p><p> <strong>  The Secret to Leadership </strong></p><p> The real secret to leadership is no secret at all. You can call yourself whatever you want, but only those who work for you can call you a leader. And that won't happen - being a leader - unless you have a robust and open feedback loop enabling you to know whether you&rsquo;re leading a team of followers eager to support you in your cause, or commanding a group of hostages waiting for their chance to escape.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.crackerjackmarketing.com/blog/author/christina-strickland\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Christina Strickland  </a> </u></p><p> Social media has changed the way brands reach customers. It has redefined interacting and sharing, provided new ways to use content to promote products and services, and made engagement easier. If that&rsquo;s not enough, it&rsquo;s also amplified the voice of the customers. Here&rsquo;s what three top brands can teach us about social media and viral content. </p><p> <strong>  1. Coca Cola Highlights the Importance of Accountability and Transparency </strong></p><p> Coca Cola is undeniably the most sought-after brand when it comes to the soft drink industry. Still, it is impressive to see how this big brand is embracing the social media culture to follow through with customers and promote its campaigns. For instance, Coca Cola created an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/expedition-206-revisiting-cokes-epic-quest-for-the-source-of-happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Expedition 206  </a> </u>  campaign in which it used social media to pick three individuals to act as the company&rsquo;s Happiness Ambassadors. <br/> <br/> These individuals will go around the world to interact with people and share the idea of happiness on a personal level and via real-life contact. Using videos, photography, blog postings, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social networks, the three will share their adventures with the world as they happen.  <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s heartening to know that a big brand like Coca Cola realizes the importance of being accountable and transparent to its consumers by making them part of the campaign through social media. Coca Cola knows how to touch people&rsquo;s lives. The proof of this is evident in how the company effectively defined sharing happiness. Where will happiness strike next? Isn&rsquo;t that worth a share? <br/>  </p><p> <strong>  2. Dove's Meaningful Content </strong> <br/> <br/> When we think about soap, we think of making our skin smoother, healthier and cleaner. We think about beauty being only skin deep.  <u>  Dove&rsquo;s Real Beauty Sketches </u>  (above) have changed the paradigm of content used for promoting a brand. It promoted something intangible and deep that made it more interesting. It dealt with a self-esteem boosting message: &ldquo;You are more beautiful than you think.&rdquo; It was a great piece of a meaningful content without showing much of the logo. You wouldn&rsquo;t even think it was a soap advertisement. Social media is more than just knowing a certain product&rsquo;s specifications. It has changed the arena of human experience. We want to be aware of almost everyone&rsquo;s perspective. How we look at things and what people think about us&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we really care about. That&rsquo;s what we really want to share. That&rsquo;s the reason this content became the most viral ad. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. IKEA&rsquo;s Interactive and Engaging Way of Bringing Great Relevance to Your Home </strong> <br/> <br/> Change begins at home. No matter who you are or what your design tastes, there&rsquo;s something IKEA offers that will really help create a beautiful space. Some of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IKEAUSA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IKEA&rsquo;s campaigns  </a> </u>  use interactive and engaging online videos to make small places big. They are useful for everyone. Others follow the instructions shared through blogs or through content that has been shared on the Web and via social media. The satisfaction IKEA brings its customers and the fascinating content it creates is a great experience worth sharing with family and friends.</p><p> These three big brands shared major social media lessons by highlighting the importance of authenticity, accountability and transparency when communicating with customers. Moreover, creating more meaningful, interactive and engaging content inspires consumer to share their great experiences with their friends, families and other members of the social community.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  \"What we learn only through the ears makes less impression upon our minds than what is presented to the trustworthy eye.\" </strong> ~ Horace</p><p> Next to recruitment, the hiring process and managing foreward, onboarding is an organization's playbook that communicates how important its employees are. After going through this process numerous times, often one can correlate how their onboarding experience predicts how the remaining career may go. Turnover or churn costs money, drains profits, and can be avoided. I recommend organizations evaluate its \"first impressions\" and escalate the importance to be in line with recruiting the best talent. <br/> <br/> Fortunately, I have had the distinction of being hired by some heavy weights. Unfortunately, the size or reputation of the organization does not guarantee a strong onboarding experience. Often the vision statements and first day experience don't match up. Size or reputation don't necessarily align with onboarding excellence. Circumstances don't dictate whether it will be positive either -- whether you were hired by the President or an HR professional tasked with recruiting.</p><p> It shouldn't matter who is being hired: an executive, a middle manager or frontline employee. An onboarding strategy communicates to new employees how important they are in the scheme of things and can foreshadows events. Minimizing first day enthusiasm is detrimental to your organization. <br/> <br/> Those on Linked In or elsewhere spend a lot of time helping others get hired, then skip right into organizational issues -- leadership, best/worse bosses, communications, etc. etc. Yet onboarding, tends to be flat or ignored altogether: a foray of forms, introductions, etc.</p><p> Thankfully, there a few organizations that are fluid in all its dealing with new employees, from its recruiting to hiring to onboarding. They haven't skipped over to organizational charts, assigning responsibilities, setting performance metrics. Simply said: a \"produce or perish\" mentality doesn't bode well for the most optimistic or talented individual. An avoidable poor tone can override any excitement and compound nerves that can carry forward for days or years to come. After all the tests on intelligence, cultural fit, experience and reference checks, why isn't onboarding as important as all of that? Seems like a no brainer to me, yet it is often overlooked. I can identify with poor onboarding experiences. I've seen colleagues start on their first day, not know who will greet them, no ID badge, no computer, no computer log on, business cards, parking pass, etc.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding\" target=\"_blank\">   WIKIPEDIA  </a> </u>  \"onboarding\" means (adapted from Bauer &amp; Erdogan, 2011):</p><p> Onboarding, also known as organizational socialization, refers to the mechanism through which new  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employees\" target=\"_blank\">   employees  </a> </u>  acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members and insiders. <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding#cite_note-orgsocial-1\" target=\"_blank\">   [1]  </a> </u>  Tactics used in this process include formal meetings, lectures, videos, printed materials, or computer-based orientations to introduce newcomers to their new jobs and organizations. Research has demonstrated that these socialization techniques lead to positive outcomes for new employees such as higher  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_satisfaction\" target=\"_blank\">   job satisfaction  </a> </u> , better  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_performance\" target=\"_blank\">   job performance  </a> </u> , greater  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_commitment\" target=\"_blank\">   organizational commitment  </a> </u> , and reduction in  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_stress\" target=\"_blank\">   occupational stress  </a> </u>  and intent to quit. <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding#cite_note-Ashford.2C_S._J._1996-2\" target=\"_blank\">   [2]  </a>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding#cite_note-KammeyerMueller2003-3\" target=\"_blank\">   [3]  </a>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding#cite_note-Fisher.2C_C._D._1985-4\" target=\"_blank\">   [4]  </a> </u>  These outcomes are particularly important to an organization looking to retain a competitive advantage in an increasingly mobile and globalized workforce. In the United States, for example, up to 25% of workers are organizational newcomers engaged in an onboarding process. <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding#cite_note-5\" target=\"_blank\">   [5]  </a> </u></p><p> There you have it: organizational socialization. Any organization that demonstrates a caring for that new employee usually has planned this important \"first impression\" that lasts, disguised as onboarding that communicates:</p><li> We're happy to have you</li><li> You made a great decision to join us</li><li> We will prepare you for your job</li><li> We will ensure you know who, what, where you will start</li><li> We will support your success in every step of the way</li><li> We will onboard you: orientation, training, and an Agenda</li><li> We will ensure that someone will be there to greet you</li><li> We will assign a mentor who shows the right behaviors</li><li> We will ensure that you have all the tools from Day 1</li>At minimum, a new hire checklist with assigned responsible party should be mapped out and assigned:<br/> <li> A computer with log on credentials - IT</li><li> An ID badge - Security</li><li> Someone to greet you: your manager or a mentor</li><li> Where you will go: a training room, an orientation classroom, a desk - HR</li><li> An agenda: what you can expect in the upcoming days until you start assignment</li><li> Paperwork: forms, more forms to fill out, Policies, Code of Ethics, etc.</li><li> Training or orientation: a classroom or boardroom where you are given an overview, history, expectations, paperwork, benefits</li><li> Anything that communicates the company is happy to have the new recruit</li><li> omething that communicates that the company is happy to have the new recruit</li><li> Lunch with your new Manager, Mentor or team</li><li> Executive welcome on your first day in orientation or training room</li><li> An orientation or training environment where you meet others on similar first day</li><li> A video or something that intimately introduces your company (marketing, testimonial videos from happy customers, happy employees)  </li><p> You can sweeten the experience and establish first day traditions:</p><li> ​Anything that communicates the company is happy to have the new recruit</li><li> Lunch with the new Manager, Mentor or team</li><li> Executive welcome on the first day </li><li> An orientation or training environment to meet others who share the first day</li><li> A video or something that intimately introduces your company (marketing, testimonial videos from happy customers, happy employees)</li><p> Granted, logistics, schedules and a whole whack of other interfering factors can hamper that first day experience. Simply said, don't assume the manager can ensure all the particulars are taken care of while multitasking: taking care of business, supervising other employees, meeting with customers, etc.. You can't assume either that HR has it all covered. They may be assume it is the recruiting or benefits, payroll forms. IT may have a serious matter to take of that distracted them from their responsibilities.</p><p> By having an ONBOARDING Agenda with responsibilities assigned (and those assigned have backup designated) is as important as any and all recruiting process. Even better, if it is mapped out visually like your organizational chart. Just don't assume that it is taken care of.</p><p> <strong>  \"Never assume everyone knows something:  that only guarantees nothing will get done.\" </strong> ~ Jeannette Marshall</p>  ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Cogito Ergo Sum.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> This Latin expression, which translates to &ldquo;I think, therefore I am&rdquo;, was written by Rene Descartes in 1644.  While Descartes was true to assume that critical thinking is essential for effective planning and management, is thinking enough?  Of course not.</p><p> It is interesting to note that while Descartes was a thinker, he translated his thoughts into words, (i.e. his actions), and thus became one of the most influential philosophers of all time.</p><p> No matter what we call it&hellip;when you want to take action on something&hellip;your intention is only the first step.  We can have the &ldquo;best of intent&rdquo; but unless we take action&hellip;unless we take that first step towards the outcomes we want, our intention is just a useless piece of land surrounded by deep water.  So do all that you can to swim away from &ldquo;Intention Island.&rdquo;  And move towards actions and results. </p><p> Outcomes. Goals. Results. Vision.</p><p> Our goals can change. They should change.  Our life changes. Organizations change.  Things happen.  Sometimes expected and many times un-expected.  We need to be able to evolve, to bend, to be flexible.  But we still need to keep our eyes on our targets, our goals, our outcomes.  We still need to measure our progress towards our vision, otherwise we will never move off  &ldquo;Intention Island.&rdquo;</p><p> Charting your outcomes enables you to keep track of your progress towards your desired end results, no matter the detours our lives may take.  As you find your VOICE as a Leader, charting your outcomes aligned to your values is critical in moving from intent to action.  Build your bridge...learn to swim...float on a raft...but don't stay marooned on Intention Island like other leaders!</p><p> Finding your V-O-I-C-E as a leader means discovering your core Values; creating a compelling vision to obtain the Outcomes you want; building relationships with Influence and credibility; making decisions that use your Courage to stand alone; and communicating your overall Expression for lasting impact.</p><p> As a leader, it is necessary for you to re-design Descartes&rsquo; philosophy into &ldquo;I do, therefore I am&rdquo;.</p><p> Life is too short not to find your VOICE as a leader.  What are you waiting for?</p>",

    "link": "how-to-really-blog-more-in-2015-10-ways-to-generate-ideas",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.thesocialms.com/author/jogebaugooglemail-com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jonathan Gebauer  </a> </u>  | <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.thesocialms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Social Marketers  </a> </u></p><p> It&rsquo;s the same procedure every year: Bloggers decide next year they will write more. But is writing really what is causing the trouble?</p><p> It&rsquo;s 2014 (almost 2015) and running a blog just when you feel like it will not get you far. At least not when you want to reach an audience. Less than an article a week and you can stop right away &ndash; actually you should plan releasing at least 3 per week. Can you come up with enough content?</p><p> If you are like me writing is easy. Once I have an idea about what I want to write about, most of the time it&rsquo;s just about having enough time to write the actual article. And modern day technology allows me to do this almost anywhere I am: In a subway or train or even in the park. Not having enough time is almost the worst possible excuse for not writing on your blog.</p><p> <strong>  So, How Do You Get The Ideas? </strong></p><p> Having the time is only one part of the job for me though. What I really need is ideas: What will I write about today? What are my readers interested in? What am I currently interested in? Do I know enough about the topic to write a complete article?</p><p> When you are starting out writing your own blog, this is really tough. For me, the easiest part of writing is actually writing itself. The hardest part? Finding stuff to write about. This is what I really had to learn and to this day I still discover new ways of tackling this problem.</p><p> But one thing I learned is that ideas are everywhere. The problem is not generating them, it is uncovering them. So, let me give you an incomplete list of ways to uncover ideas for your next blogpost:</p><p> <strong>  1. Tracing Your Thoughts Backwards </strong></p><p> No idea what to write about today? That is because you are trying to think about what to write about &ndash; so think about how your thoughts wandered around today. You are having millions of different lines of thoughts every day, there&rsquo;s almost definitely a good topic among the thoughts you had in the past couple of hours. The key is not to think about your next blogpost, but your last interesting thoughts.</p><p> <strong>  2. Keep a List of Blogs That You Enjoy Reading and Follow Them </strong></p><p> Blogs that you enjoy reading (when they cover the same line of topics of course) are really a great way of uncovering ideas. Don&rsquo;t fear that you are copying them as that is not what this is about. All you need is simply one single aspect that you can add to their articles and you already have something to write about. Or maybe you even disagree completely? Great! Write an answer to their post. Maybe you can combine the ideas of two different posts into a new one? The possibilities are endless.</p><p> <strong>  3. What Happened to You Lately </strong></p><p> Your life can&rsquo;t be as boring as you sometimes think it is. Something always happens. And you can and should write about it. And this works even if your topic is something else. A few days ago I wrote an article where I derived a sales lesson from when my mobile was stolen.</p><p> <strong>  4. Write From the Perspective of Someone Else </strong></p><p> Susanna once wrote an article with marketing lessons from our dog. Giving a topic a new and unconventional perspective is almost a sure fire way to create something interesting and fun to read. Think about the people you know &ndash; how would they view a certain topic? If you don&rsquo;t know &ndash; why don&rsquo;t you ask them?</p><p> <strong>  5. Do Something Else &ndash; Then Write About It </strong></p><p> When you&rsquo;re starting out your job is probably not writing on your blog. You almost definitely have other things in your life &ndash; so whenever you feel that writer&rsquo;s block is knocking on your door, do something else first. As a blogger that is a major advantage you have over (other) professional writers: You don&rsquo;t have to come up with something for a living, on the contrary &ndash; what you do in your life can enrich what you write.</p><p> <strong>  6. Write Follow Up Posts to Old Posts </strong></p><p> Just because you wrote about a topic once doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t write about it again. You learn new things, you get new ideas and you can write a follow-up to the original post. This also drives new traffic to your original post &ndash; so this is beneficial in more than one way.</p><p> <strong>  7. Watch What&rsquo;s Trending in Social Media </strong></p><p> What is trending in your niche, what&rsquo;s discussed a lot and what do people think about your topics of interest. You do have an opinion of your own and sometimes it is worth writing an article about it.</p><p> <strong>  8. Don&rsquo;t Plan Ahead &ndash; Let Ideas Lead to Ideas </strong></p><p> Often I believe that I will write an article from an idea that has a certain direction &ndash; only to find out that while writing new ideas come to me. Most of the time it is far more rewarding to follow the flow of ideas than to stick to the original plan. It creates original articles that are truly worth reading &ndash; and writing them is a lot more fun.</p><p> <strong>  9. Write About Something Else </strong></p><p> Writing just about one topic can lead to writing fatigue. But you are not writing a book &ndash; you are writing a blog. If you bring in other topics you are interested in from time to time you are not breaking any rules. On the contrary: You give your blog more personality, you keep your writing fresh and you keep your ideas coming. So allow yourself to venture to other areas. At least sometimes.</p><p> <strong>  10. Just Go with the Flow </strong></p><p> This is somewhat undefined but maybe the most important tip I can give you: Just take the ideas as they come. Take this post for example &ndash; I had no idea what to write so I wrote a post about how to get ideas. Ideas are everywhere so just start writing.</p><p> <strong>  Final Words </strong></p><p> Many bloggers plan to write more in the coming years &ndash; and it&rsquo;s the same new years resolution every year. I don&rsquo;t believe that writing more is the actual problem they have. The real problem is having a topic to write about at the moment when you are ready to write. If the above list can help you even a little then this post has achieved what I wanted it to achieve.</p><p> But this post is not complete in any way: there are many more ways to get ideas to write about. Every blogger needs to find his own way. How do you find your ideas?</p>",

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s that time of the year where people make predictions for the coming year and I&rsquo;m not going to be any different, here we go:-</p><p> <strong>  Smartphones </strong>  &ndash; Yet another Apple iPhone, the iPhone 7 will be released.</p><p> <strong>  iWatch </strong>  &ndash; Will be launched and people will go wild over it.</p><p> <strong>  Cloud </strong>  &ndash; Will be come the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; platform for Business Application purchases. Spending on Cloud will increase, more companies will have &ldquo;Cloud First&rdquo; policies. Innovation in Public Cloud will continue.</p><p> <strong>  PaaS </strong>  &ndash; Platform as a Service (PaaS) will become to be seen as the way to deliver application extensions or bespoke developments.</p><p> <strong>  Wearables </strong>  &ndash; We will start to see &ldquo;Wearables&rdquo; clothes in High Street shops, as they make the leap from Geek to mainstream.  Google Glass was never going to make the mainstream.  In my experience, Google was never really behind the project, plus they made you look a little silly.  Maybe with the skill of Intel behind the next version, it will give it that much needed push.  That said, I&rsquo;m more tempted with an iWatch or Wearable in terms of Clothes.  I attended the Google Glass UK launch and wasn&rsquo;t very impressed and the fact there was zero follow up made me think are these guys really into taking this mainstream.</p><p> <strong>  Internet of Things </strong>  &ndash; The public will see Internet of Things (IoT) functionality in everyday household items &ndash; Starting a revolution in replacement of everyday household items.  It is expected that in the level of maturity we will see a move from &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; to &ldquo;smart&rdquo; household items.  Many manufactures will jump on the band wagon and push for massive appliance replacement, what they will call &ldquo;new and improved&rdquo; will actually be just a chip being stuck in today&rsquo;s products.</p><p> <strong>  Crowdfunding </strong>  &ndash; Will become mainstream and there will be more bizarre items, services seeking funding as people push the boundaries of any new way of working. Next year there will be more calls to regulate Crowdfunding.</p><p> <strong>  Amazonation </strong>  &ndash; Of Retail will continue both inside of Amazon and across retail. Apple and Amazon will continue their &ldquo;arms race&rdquo; to get access to the consumer transactions.</p><p> <strong>  3D Printing </strong>  &ndash; Will become more mainstream (rather than experimental) with more everyday items being printed.  Don&rsquo;t expect to own a 3D Printer until 2017.</p><p> <strong>  Marketing ROI </strong>  &ndash; Marketers will be under more pressure to prove ROI and will become under increased pressure to get closer and work with Sales.</p><p> <strong>  Big Data </strong>  &ndash; The privacy debate will continue.  People will realise that maybe people don&rsquo;t actually tell the truth when they fill in questionnaires, which will place a question mark over Big Data results.  One area of Big Data that will expand is the use of Big Data for Healthcare.</p><p> <strong>  Technology Shift </strong>  &ndash; There will be a continued shift from PC to Tablet, from Smartphone to Phablets and from On Premises to Public Cloud.</p><p> <strong>  Hashtags </strong>  &ndash; Hashtag Tedium will take over as a hashtags become another &ldquo;tick box&rdquo; &ldquo;must have&rdquo; for a brand to look cool.</p><p> <strong>  Mobile </strong>  &ndash; Delivery of services to mobile (in many cases via an App) will become a business imperative.  The move to mobile and &ldquo;Mobile First&rdquo; started in 2014. Customer Experience has to be delivered via mobile in 2015.</p><p> <strong>  Security </strong>  &ndash; Hacking of sites will continue.  There is a &ldquo;Keyboard War&rdquo; of Hackers Vs the Rest of the World.  Users must be ever vigilant, not click on URLs, install a virus checker, etc.  IT Departments must &ldquo;assume you have been hacked&rdquo; and work back from there.</p><p> <strong>  Selfies </strong>  &ndash; The selfie trend will continue having crossed over into polite society in 2014.  2015 will be a year of Selfie Tedium as big brands see a &ldquo;Selfie on Instagram campaign&rdquo; as a &ldquo;must have&rdquo;. Yawn.</p><p> <strong>  Instagram </strong>  &ndash; Will continue the almost unnoticed march to become the Social platform of choice for teenagers and the mainstream.</p>",

    "link": "note-to-advisors-caution-your-aging-clients-about-scams",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When your aging client has contact with you, consider it an opportunity to educate them about more than the status of their portfolio you manage.  Your client&rsquo;s  efforts to maintain financial safety can be thwarted by clever scammers who are constantly devising new ways to take advantage of them.  You are in a perfect position to help keep them informed about financial abuse and the latest information on tactics scammers use.  Don&rsquo;t make it someone else&rsquo;s problem. Make it part of your services.</p><p> <strong>  Take for example the &ldquo;grandma I need help&rdquo; scam.   </strong> My 92 year old mother in law told me about this one.  Someone actually had the nerve to try it with her, but she&rsquo;s smarter than they were and it didn&rsquo;t work. However, one of her friends did fall into the trap. Somehow the scammers got a list of phone numbers of many of the seniors living in the nicely appointed neighborhood in her retirement community.  They get a young man to call from their list of numbers and say &ldquo;Grandma?&rdquo; when a woman answers.  If she thinks it&rsquo;s her grandson, she&rsquo;s bait. The thief then says he&rsquo;s in trouble, with some made-up some story to get her to worry about him. He then asks her to wire money right away to get him out of this jam.  The unsuspecting do it. And get taken.</p><p> <strong>  A newer scam is the gift basket trick. </strong>  Again, the older person&rsquo;s phone number and address are known to the thieves.  They call the potential victim to be sure he&rsquo;s home and then tell him they&rsquo;re Express Courier or any other name and they have a gift delivery. Will he be home in the next hour?  If the victim says &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;ll be  here&rdquo; an official looking truck with a courier name on it pulls up within the hour, and the delivery man hands the victim a lovely basket of wine and flowers.  The trap is in the delivery man then asking the victim for payment for a &ldquo;delivery fee&rsquo;&rsquo; because the basket has alcohol and had to be hand delivered to an adult rather than left on the doorstep.  Or so they say. The fake courier insists on a credit card payment rather than cash, even if the fee is just $3.50.  He uses a small portable credit card scanner and asks for the PIN number for any debit card. What the victim does not know is that the scanner is a device used to steal the credit card information, in the way this kind of information has been stolen from ATMs and gas station credit card machines in the past.  The scanner the courier uses even prints out a nice little receipt, making it all the more believable.</p><p> The victim doesn&rsquo;t realize his credit card information has been used to make a dummy credit card with his name on it, which the thieves quickly use until the victim cancels the card. Thousands of dollars can be stolen from the victim&rsquo;s by ATM cash withdrawals and numerous purchases before the victim knows what is going on.  People are getting tricked by this. The scam is working for the scammers and you know they will keep doing it until the public gets well informed enough to decline the offer of the fake gift delivery over the phone.</p><p> If you are managing accounts for older clients, take the opportunity to help educate them about these nasty fraudsters who are easily able to get their names and phone numbers.  You can make a difference.  Tell them in person or make a handout about scams to email or send to them.  They may see you as protective of their financial safety in more ways than one. That can uplift your image, always a good thing.  We&rsquo;ll keep you informed about elder abuse and how to protect your aging clients right here at  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AgingInvestor.com </a> .</p> <p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> The Google Maps function, formerly known as \"Google Places,\" is now part of the Google My Business dashboard &ndash; Google&rsquo;s dashboard for managing and tracking your online presence across Google&rsquo;s various platforms including Google Local (Google Maps), Google+, Google Analytics and Adwords.</p><p> As you&rsquo;re preparing to set up your listing, just a reminder &ndash; although Google will, in some situations, display businesses from surrounding communities in the &ldquo;Local&rdquo; search results (Maps), you are only allowed to register your business in the town or city in which you have a physical address.</p><p> <strong>  Adding or Claiming Your Business on Google My Business </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re an established business, chances are your business already exists in the Google My Business directory and you&rsquo;ll just need to claim it. New businesses or new locations will probably have to be added.</p><p> <strong>  1. Go to   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.google.com/business/\" target=\"_blank\">    Google My Business   </a>  </u>  . </strong></p><li> <p>  Click &ldquo;Get on Google&rdquo; </p></li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/googlemaps1.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> <strong>  2.

Select or Add Your Business. </strong></p><p> Click on your business listing if it appears among the suggested matches. If not select &ldquo;Add your Business&rdquo;, and provide the necessary information.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"364\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/googlemaps3.png\" width=\"350\"/></p><p> TIP: Determine how you want your business Name-Address-Phone Number (NAP) to appear across the web and use that NAP here (i.e. Will you spell out S-t-r-e-e-t, or use St.?) The address that you use here should become your default address across the web. Consistency is important.</p><p> As you answer questions, remember that the more specific and accurate the information Google has about your business, the better it will be able to correctly classify and display your business listing.</p><p> <strong>  Category Selection </strong></p><p> Near the bottom of the form, you will be asked to choose a Category that describes your business.</p><p> The category selection is very important as it is essentially the way Google will classify your business, and the type of search query it will display your listing for.</p><p> Google has preset Categories, or keywords, for each industry. Start typing your keyword in to see if Google produces a match, then select the best one. You will get a chance to add more categories later on (up to 5).</p><p> <strong>  4. Verify Your Business </strong></p><p> Google will want to verify that your business is located where you say that it is. This usually means waiting 1-2 weeks for a postcard with a verification PIN.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/googlemaps4.png\" width=\"369\"/></p><p> Occasionally you&rsquo;ll be given the option to receive your PIN by text message or or automated phone call &ndash; take it &ndash; it&rsquo;s much faster and easier!</p><p> TIP: If you do have to wait on a postcard, remind anyone that handles the mail to be on the lookout for it, then try to verify it as soon as you get it (you have 30 days). You&rsquo;d be surprised how often businesses have to go through the verification process 2 or 3 times because someone threw the postcard away or forgot to use it once they received it.</p><p> <strong>  5. Confirm your Business. Set up a Google+ Page. </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/googlemaps5.png\" width=\"392\"/></p><p> Setting up your Google My Business page is the first step in Local Search Optimization, and should be a high priority for all businesses hoping to be found online.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Ready to kick your marketing plan into overdrive next year? With the abundance of challenges and changes facing the financial industry today you need to ensure your firm remains relevant to clients and new investors. Your attention and ability to adapt to their preferences and expectations is crucial.</p><p> The role of your marketing department is and will continue to be under an enormous amount of pressure to change and develop new strategies to meet asset and revenue goals. Marketing efforts must evolve from old school &ldquo;batch-and-blast&rdquo; methods to strategies developing client intimacy and long-term client engagement.</p><p> Effective marketing delivers a targeted message, showcases your areas of expertise and value you provide, creating a demand for your products and services.  </p><p> Your marketing plan should be as unique as your firm, but there are some basics advisors need to consider.</p><h3> <strong>  1) Be Client Focused &amp; See It Their Way </strong></h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s client won&rsquo;t hesitate to walk away from your firm if you don&rsquo;t meet their needs. Client-focused experience is critical to growth and ensures your clients are at the center of your firm&rsquo;s philosophy. Create a service model to engage with clients beyond the scope of typical conversation; anticipate their needs and follow up on opportunities.</p><h3> <strong>  2) Identify Your Niche - You Can&rsquo;t Be All Things To All People </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many advisors fear focusing on niche markets limits their opportunities. In reality, the opposite typically occurs and your firm is positioned to demonstrate your expertise more effectively. Make it a priority to identify and understand your niche market inside and out. Create key marketing messages that speak to each niche and attract them to your firm.   </p><h3> <strong>  3) Use Segmentation To Ensure Your Content Is Valuable </strong></h3><p> <br/> Top producing firms provide targeted information based on client need. Avoid wasting precious time and dollars on masses of generic miscellaneous communication. An enhanced segmentation method is one of the first steps advisors can make for greater efficiency and ultimately improved profitability. By focusing on client behaviors, assets held outside of your firm, and specific challenges and needs of each segment, you will reach higher levels of engagement and response rates, resulting in shorter conversion cycles.</p><h3> <strong>  4) Optimize Your Website </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your website is a marketing opportunity that can&rsquo;t be overlooked. It is a well-known fact that prospective clients will look for your online presence before making contact or deciding to do business with you. Be proactive and make certain that each page of your site is up to date with correct information. Provide value through your site with articles, blogs, and case studies that are fresh, engaging, and resonate with your target audience.  </p><h3> <strong>  5) Communicate Your Message </strong></h3><p> <br/> The methods you use to communicate with clients and prospects are vital to your marketing plan and strategy.</p><p> A successful communication plan enhances relationships once you determine the preferred and expected communication methods from your market versus methods easiest for your firm. Leverage social media to expand your reach, increase brand awareness, and position your firm as industry experts.  </p><p> By applying each of these marketing basics, your firm will create a client-centric culture with targeted messages to reach your market. Keep in mind, it&rsquo;s about your client, not you. Each of the 5 basics will help you shape your final marketing plan. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  CDW Financial Services </u></p><p> For financial services organizations from banks to credit unions to capital markets firms, the cloud remains a cost-effective and sensible option to store and manage the vast amounts of data required for day-to-day operations, compliance requirements and gaining a competitive advantage. In fact, the cloud has become so ubiquitous that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/publications/viewpoints/cloud-computing-data-center-consolidation.jhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   71%  </a> </u>  of financial services execs say they will invest more in the cloud this year.</p><p> Benefits of the cloud include improved IT performance, better management of email, and support for cloud-based unified communications and collaboration tools. Yet, despite the cloud&rsquo;s many advantages, today&rsquo;s heightened state of cyberattacks has made it more difficult &mdash; and more critical &mdash; to secure financial data there.</p><p> If your firm is considering the cloud but you&rsquo;re still wary of the potential security risks, fear not. There are reasonable security measures that can ensure your data and applications are safeguarded. Start by asking yourself these four questions about your data. The answers will highlight any potential security issues before you migrate to the cloud.</p><li> <p>  <strong>   How risky is it?   </strong>  Carefully consider the data (potentially) being moved to the cloud. The more sensitive the data, the riskier it is to store it in a cloud architecture. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   How will it be used?   </strong>  Determine who will use the data (customers, members, employees?) and who will have access to it (external vendors?). Widely used applications &mdash; email or unified communications, for example &mdash; are good candidates for the cloud, but applications used only by internal employees are better stored in a private cloud environment. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   How will it be transferred?  </strong>   Frequent, high-volume data transfers can complicate cloud deployments. Also, public clouds require additional overhead (such as encryption) to secure the traffic. It may make more sense to keep certain data and applications at the institution&rsquo;s own facilities. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   How often should it be available?   </strong>  If data must be available all the time, with no scheduled outage windows, public cloud architecture is a good fit. Multiple clouds with different Internet service providers may also be a good option to support business continuity. </p></li><p> If cybersecurity fears are keeping you up at night, you&rsquo;re not alone. We found that  <u>  53% </u>  of bank managers say frequency of cyberattacks is on the rise. But security concerns shouldn&rsquo;t prevent your organization from taking advantage of the cloud. Check out our latest white paper, <a href=\"http://webobjects.cdw.com/webobjects/media/pdf/Solutions/Financial/Protecting-Financial-Services-Cloud-Data-145526.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Protecting Financial Services Cloud Data and Applications  </u>  ,&rdquo; </a>  to learn more.</p>",

It stood out because of a calm confidence. &ldquo;Calm&rdquo; and &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; are words &ndash; and qualities &ndash; we don&rsquo;t get very much.</p><p> Holiday seasons tend to be hectic. And because of one rapidly upsetting news event after another, this holiday season in the US seems to make &ldquo;discordance&rdquo; the word of the day. I thought it might be useful to step back a moment &ndash; dial the speed down a notch &ndash; and reflect on this speech excerpt:</p><p> &ldquo;I may not be the most eloquent, but I learned early that eloquence won&rsquo;t draw oil from the ground. I may sometimes be a little awkward, but there there&rsquo;s nothing self-conscious about my love of country. I am a quiet man, but I hear the quiet people others don&rsquo;t &ndash; the ones who raise the family, pay the taxes, meet the mortgages. I hear them and I am moved.&rdquo;</p><p> The take-away line for me this news week is: &ldquo;I am a quiet man, but I hear the quiet people others don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p> Speaking is important. Listening is, too.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> For the last couple of years, Google&rsquo;s algorithm has increasingly emphasized the importance of quality content. Therefore, the focus is not anymore on how well keywords are picked up and included on your pages, but on how much each one make sense within a certain context. At this game, financial advisors are stronger than they think!</p><p> <strong>  Financial advisors have already all the content needed to succeed! </strong></p><p> Financial advisors, Wealth managers, Asset Managers, Trust Officers, Lawyers&hellip; these people are probably part of your staff and have tremendous experiences and knowledge to share with prospective clients. Therefore, this is no need to seek great content or to pay a PR firm to write it for you. You can do it yourself by taking advantage of your staff great qualifications and experiences. This can be done through several ways:</p><li> A daily tweet commenting the market closure</li><li> A weekly or monthly article detailing the importance of the latest FED or ECB interest rates moves</li><li> A video interview or a webinar about the best strategies to secure assets in geographically risky regions of the world</li><p> There are many more examples to follow according to your client&rsquo;s interest and own expertise.</p><p> <strong>  Organize your content powerhouse </strong></p><p> To ensure a constant flow of great quality content, it is essential to organize yourself. Depending on your staff size, expertise&rsquo;s and field, you can set it up in various ways :</p><li> Frequency: From the moment you decide your publishing frequency (once a week, once every two weeks, etc), distribute the work within your team. No matter how busy your staff members are, writing an article per month is far from overwhelming.</li><li> Topic: This is the moment you want to display your competitive advantage to your leads and prove them you are the best for the job. Therefore, make dedicated articles or videos about what you know the best according to your client&rsquo;s interests!</li><li> Events: The interest rate changes by the FED or ECB can have big consequences on the global economy as well as your own client&rsquo;s investment portfolio. Therefore, your insights will be highly expected onto what to do next.</li><p> Make sure you push forward your expertise as well as what makes you special in the eyes of your clients (efficiency, responsiveness, commitment and more).</p><p> <strong>  Share your knowledge to the world </strong></p><p> Just like any business, if you have a great product but don&rsquo;t know how to sell it, you won&rsquo;t go far. Now that you have organized your content engine so to work consistently based on your client&rsquo;s and lead&rsquo;s interest, you got to know how to reach them. No matter your budget and resources, you got many possibilities:</p><li> Self-blogging: Adding a blog page to your website is the simplest way to display your expertise for potential leads. Besides, it is a great way to improve your website&rsquo;s ranking on search engines.</li><li> Guest-blogging: Find out authority players in your field and ask them to become a guest blogger. This way, you can increase your visibility and benefit from their traffic.</li><li> Newsletter: Regularly sending a newsletter is the best way to keep in touch with your clients and leads. Make sure they remember you with relevance, instead of spamming them.</li><li> Conferences: Being a guest at a conference is a great way to directly interact with the audience on various topics and get a pulse on what&rsquo;s important for your potential leads and other experts. It is also a great opportunity to enjoy a strong media coverage for a reasonable amount of money.</li><li> Social Media: You have here the great opportunity to reach a considerable amount of people, while carefully selecting them in advance, for a very good price. Linkedin and Twitter are some of the most used social media by their clients to know, as soon as possible, what&rsquo;s going on with their money. Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and other big names cannot be overlooked because all of these reach different target groups you actually might be interest in. Therefore, make sure you answer these simple two questions before you make your move &mdash; who are my clients and where do they find information?</li><p> Traditional medias (newspapers, radio, TV) can also be of interest depending on your budget and target group. The most important is to come up with a mix based on your resources and the maximum efficiency.</p>",

Just like in King of the Hill &ndash; you&rsquo;re either lost in the crowd or have everyone against you. And it&rsquo;s a quick slide down.</p><p> A full decade before the iPad, Microsoft introduced a tablet computer. By all rights, it should have dominated the market. Microsoft practically ruled the world at the time. But its poor design &ndash; including its weight &ndash; and poor user interface relegated it to niche status.</p><p> (It should be noted here that Apple&rsquo;s Newton debuted even earlier and is considered by many to be the company&rsquo;s greatest failure. Just in case you thought Apple could do no wrong, remember this is a company that flirted with bankruptcy right around 2000.)</p><p> <u>  Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; </u>  with the iPhone, which paved the way for the iPad, caught everyone flat-footed and essentially rebooted an entire industry practically overnight.</p><p> But I&rsquo;d echo the argument that its iTunes product was the real game-changer. Not only did it disrupt not one but two industries (and counting), it quietly laid the foundation for what would come later. But Apple wasn&rsquo;t first here, either. Microsoft&rsquo;s media player launched before that. But, again, it was clunky and simply a pain to work with.</p><p> (Not to belabor the point, but iTunes not only upended the traditional music business, but completely changed how nearly everyone consumes music. It disrupted as many industries as it gave birth to.)</p><p> Without picking on Microsoft anymore, we&rsquo;ve seen this play out in other industries, as well. Blockbusters were as ubiquitous as Starbucks, but came crashing down all because of a stubborn reliance on late fees for revenue &ndash; and faster Internet access.</p><p> (Funny thing here is that while Netflix, David to Blockbuster's Goliath, now finds itself set upon by a host of would-be on demand video providers, including some of the content producers themselves.)</p><p> As an extension of that, we&rsquo;re seeing the long-dominant cable providers scrambling to maintain the status quo. But people have been unplugging at an incredible clip, and now that at least one major cable and broadcast network have announced plans to offer standalone service, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before that Tower of Babel comes crashing down.</p><p> It&rsquo;s great being the market leader. But it&rsquo;s also a helluva lot more work. Status quo is your worst enemy, and while everyone might look up to you, they&rsquo;re also looking to take you down, too.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.wealthaven.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Holly Isdale  </u> </a></p><p> I was talking with a client about stress and he shared that he worries about his finances nightly.  As his net worth would dwarf many within the 1%, this seemed odd but as I too am usually awake in the middle of the night with some epiphany about a client situation or worrying about something or other, I could sympathize!  Once we worked through is portfolio and rationalized the decisions (creating a very robust investment policy guideline and a re balancing matrix), he was noticeably relieved. <br/> <br/> Lack of knowledge  &mdash; rather not having a true understanding of the realities of his situation, was the source of his unrest.</p><p> For me, lack of organization causes stress (which you&rsquo;d never know to look at my drawers, closets or &hellip; worse, my desk).  However, from a financial perspective, getting organized is not as difficult as it sounds. I like to work through the Seven &ldquo;Cs&rdquo;:</p><p> <strong>  CAPTURE </strong> &mdash; You can't manage what you can't see; take some time and list all your financial assets and liabilities in one place. Get an organizational system in place, even if its just putting things in piles on the floor so you can get everything out where you can see it. Think big picture and pull all accounts, retirement statements, social security statements, bank statements, credit cards and even your estate plans, insurance, etc. Then start to list your assets and liabilities (yes, its a balance sheet but this can be intimidating to some people as it sounds so &ldquo;formal&rdquo; and off putting to some clients). Its important to get everything you have put into one place.</p><p> <strong>  CASH </strong> &mdash; Know your cash flow &mdash; despite working with all ends of the financial spectrum for decades, I can still count on one hand the number of people who had a good sense of their cash flow needs and what they needed in reserves. I have had very wealthy women clients who are afraid of being bag ladies, because they just don&rsquo;t understand the size of their nest egg and how that cushion will protect them. Look at what you need now vs. what you need in 5-10-25 years as well. How will your income change and your outflows shift over time?  This is critical when you start to think about long-term care, retirement or assisted living needs as well.</p><p> <strong>  CONTRACTS </strong> &mdash; Understand what your contractual obligations are or will be (mortgage, taxes, credit cards), what your inflows and outflows look like.  Are these contractual (I have to pay my mortgage every month) or discretionary (I can be fired at will and lose my income)? Here you can flip through those piles of information we pulled out in the first &ldquo;C&rdquo; of &ldquo;Capture&rdquo;!  Look for those charges you have forgotten about or things you might be overlooking. In doing cash flow analysis for clients, its amazing what you find when you really start to review credit card charges, and operational expenses. We have found gym memberships that keep accruing, that online yoga website you signed up for but never use, extravagant cell phone charges when a call to the carrier can often move you to a better plan, etc. These little things all add up.</p><p> <strong>  COMMITMENTS </strong> &mdash; What have you committed, to yourself, to others, to pay out or to do? Think longer term &mdash; college, retirement, care for family, travel and then determine the costs for these. You may have to make tradeoffs but you also will feel better if you understand what the true cost is for different options than if you are fretting over perceived shortfalls. You make commitments to yourself subconsciously so this is a good time to do some introspection.  Write it down and then try to prioritize among these commitments.</p><p> <strong>  CRISIS </strong> &mdash; What do you need if there is a crisis and what is likely to hit? You are more likely to be fired or disabled than to die so focus on cash reserves and long term care insurance; but think about life insurance as an income replacement tool (which means you opt for cheaper term insurance than more expensive annuities or whole life).</p><p> <strong>  CONTAIN </strong> &mdash; Prioritize your commitments against your cash and figure out where you need to make changes. Its helpful to really look at your lifestyle overall and your outflows. If you are worried about your job stability, start planning now for alternatives in the event you are out of work. If you need to cut back on expenses, start talking to the vendors. You will find that many are willing to offer you lower rates or you can move to a different membership level, etc., to still be there.</p><p> <strong>  CONTROL </strong> &mdash; By getting ORGANIZED as to where you have issues or concerns, you can also PRIORITIZE the areas of focus and then you have a discrete list to EXECUTE on which can alleviate stress. If you can take control, even in small ways, you will have a better sense of what is manageable, where you are on your overall plan for your finances and perhaps understand what are realistic financial fears, vs. ones that are coming from other areas in your life.</p><p> You still make wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, but its probably just hormones&hellip; </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Michela Stribling </u></p><p> I kind of feel sorry for millennials. Every time I turn around, I seem to find an article that questions the millennial work ethic or examines their sense of entitlement or supposed narcissism. That&rsquo;s just a bunch of hogwash.</p><p> Silicon Valley, where I live and work, has long attracted younger generations&mdash;be they Boomers, millennials or anything in between&mdash;whose radical ideas and willingness to challenge established ways of thinking gave rise, at least in part, to the tech subculture of innovation, IPOs, and venture-funded dreams. In essence, younger generations have been the economic backbone of the tech boom and millennials are no different.</p><p> The millennials with whom I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure to work have taught me a thing or two about how to get things done.</p><p> <strong>  1. Work together &amp; collaborate </strong></p><p> Self-reliance be damned, millennials understand that working together often yields better results. This two-heads-are-better-than-one approach to problem solving may be the logical consequence of growing up as digital natives, with social networks at the ready. Regardless, it&rsquo;s worth investing heavily in enterprise social networks and other social collaboration tools to take full advantage of this trend (which, by the way, is not going to go away any time soon).</p><p> <strong>  2. Learn the power of asking why </strong></p><p> &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s one of the hardest questions to ask a room full of people who have always done things a certain way. Millennials are rather fearless in this regard and their affinity for questioning the why makes them rather agile thinkers. Learn from their example and think critically about whether a project is truly worth doing, and if so, how it could be streamlined, consolidated, or approached in an entirely fresh manner.</p><p> <strong>  3. Title does not equal authority </strong></p><p> Most of the millennials I&rsquo;ve worked with think nothing of tweeting the CEO of some company or other with a question. Indeed, they expect a prompt reply. They apply the same thinking within a corporate structure, too, sending suggestions to executives and building relationships with people up and down the entire organization. They expect a flatter hierarchy and believe that good ideas deserve an audience and full consideration, regardless of who thought them up.</p><p> So the next time you read about millennials and their supposedly woeful work ethic, consider that in fact, their approach to work and life is just different from, but no less valid than, that of prior generations. And then consider that perhaps we can learn from them, if only we have the courage to admit it.</p>",

The beautifully choreographed stunt involved five of the brand-new A350-900 jets, as well as two chase planes and a helicopter.</p><p> The costs of the shoot are unknown, but each jet has a list price of $300 million, so it's safe to assume that well over $1.5 billion of machinery was on the line.</p><p> For the shoot, Airbus pilots flew the jets in three different formations&mdash;arrow, diamond, and echelon&mdash;and completed a low pass in a diamond formation. Many of the pilots involved were ex-military members, so they were already familiar with formation flying. However, they came from a variety of different national Air Forces and Navies, so extensive pre-planning was necessary to ensure everyone understood the perfectly timed commands and signals.</p><p> Airbus's finished video showcases both the planning and execution of the incredible aerial maneuvers. It also provides a brief glimpse into how these aerial videos are shot&mdash;a process that Mike Kelley of Fstoppers has  <u>  <a href=\"https://fstoppers.com/natural-light/beautiful-look-rarely-seen-world-aviation-cinematography-2561\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   broken down  </a> </u>  in revealing detail.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.perficient.com/financialservices/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Elizabeth Dias  </a> </u></p><p> This morning I got to work and went through my usual routine of catching up on the news online, posting articles on social media, and taking a quick scan of my Facebook feed. One particular Facebook post from one of my younger friends caught my attention. He and his wife recently adopted a child and I&rsquo;m sure have been receiving a lot of paperwork these days as they go through open enrollment for medical insurance and things of that nature. They also started a college fund for him with large financial services company (which I will leave nameless). They just returned from a trip to Colorado and were going through the stack of mail to find six, yes six, letters from the wealth management firm all just regarding the confirmation of the account being setup for their son. </p><p> His comment is around the topic of &ldquo;digital&rdquo; that is often debated in the the financial industry (and other sectors too). In fact, I recently interviewed our wealth management practice director for our Perficient Perspectives series,  <a href=\"http://www.perficient.com/Thought-Leadership/Perficient-Perspectives/2014/Customer-Centricity-and-Financial-Services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Building a Customer-Centric Model in Financial Services  </u>  &rdquo; </a> . As part of this Q&amp;A series we talked about the demand for digital during all phases of the customer interaction lifecycle &ndash; from engagement, transaction, and fulfillment to servicing the client. The pile of paperwork my friend received is a perfect example of where, even with little interactions, customers react to certain processes and interactions with their financial services provider. Not to mention, if this is the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; amount of paperwork a new client receives during the on boarding process, then I cannot imagine what the financial services company is spending to create, print and mail these documents to all of their clients! Then throw in the monthly or quarterly statements regarding a client&rsquo;s assets or accounts &ndash; what kind of reaction does this cause? Well, here&rsquo;s a quote from Hemant Jaiswal from our interview that puts it into perspective:</p><p> &hellip;we&rsquo;re at a tipping point in the industry. Financial services companies must adopt more customer-centric operating models going forward or risk becoming irrelevant with consumers and corporate clients.</p><p> Research shows that this industry challenge and paradigm shift exists beyond Millennials and younger generations. In fact, according to the recent Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management  <u>  World Wealth Report 2014 </u> , &ldquo;nearly two-thirds of clients with at least $1 million or more in investable assets expect to manage most of their wealth relationships digitally in five years,&rdquo; and these clients &ldquo;would consider leaving their current firm if an &lsquo;integrated channel experience&rsquo; is not provided.</p><p> Unfortunately, digital transformation for banks and financial services companies isn&rsquo;t something that can happen over night either. For many of the larger financial firms, this is a multi-year engagement that requires a lot of integration and consolidation of legacy systems to reach the desired target state operating model. Throw in the demand for new mobile technology and digital marketing tactics, and the struggle to reach digital nirvana seems insurmountable or unobtainable. The below graphic represents a high-level overview of our approach to helping banks and financial services companies transform for tomorrow through new digital capabilities.

    "content": "<p> How to develop a social media strategy is one of the hottest topics on digital marketing blogs today. Now that there is no refuting social media&rsquo;s importance, business owners big and small want to know, &ldquo;How do I develop a more effective, efficient social media strategy that grows my customer base?&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve got just the checklist for you, but first, consider this quote from fellow digital marketer Veronica Fielding:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t want to be marketed at in the social channel. This is where they want to talk to each other, and brands are there by invitation. They have to be a great guest at the table.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> In thinking about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/category/social-media-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media marketing  </a> </u> , you have to remove your corporate cap and instead think like a fun party guest, focusing on how you can develop relevant, interesting, enjoyable, and ultimately share-worthy content. From there, a following and uptick in sales are only natural.</p><p> What do great party guests have? First of all, they look sharp and presentable. That&rsquo;s where a good social media page design comes in handy. You don&rsquo;t want your looks to deter potential fans. Secondly, they are polite and warm. You want  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-make-social-media-posts-relevant/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your social media messages to have a positive, engaging tone  </a> </u> . Thirdly, they illuminate a room with sparkling conversation. They bring a dish to pass or a gift for the host. You can achieve these objectives by crafting thoughtful blog content to share and offering special deals for your social media audience.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MG-soc-media-strategy.jpg\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> <strong>  Without further ado, here are 8 steps to a solid social media strategy: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Choose your audience. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s important to remember: You are not marketing to a stadium crowd. You are speaking to individuals. Companies often hesitate to discuss their areas of &ldquo;specialization&rdquo; because they don&rsquo;t want to alienate potential buyers or leave anyone out. We have found that companies can rarely be everything to everyone, and that a broad-brush strategy does not serve a business best. Instead, develop several core areas of buyers you want to address and make unique pitches to each market.</p><p> Sometimes this means creating a few different social media sites. For instance, Geico has different accounts for customers who wish to ask questions, customers who wish to follow racing news, and customers who love the Gecko mascot. According to recent research,  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/08/23/brands-multiple-twitter-accounts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sixty-three percent of brands  </a> </u>  have multiple presences on Twitter, In fact, the average large company has  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30656/The-Average-Large-Company-Has-178-Social-Media-Accounts-Shocking-Data.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   178 social media accounts  </a> </u> !</p><p> Other ways to  <a href=\"http://blog.raventools.com/5-ways-segment-social-media-audiences-without-advertising/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   segment your audience  </u>    </a> include using hashtags, circles, lists, filters, groups, search, and different RSS feeds for your blog.</p><p> <strong>  2. Spend time on content. </strong></p><p> The best blogs don&rsquo;t happen by chance. They are the culmination of multiple department heads sitting down to hash out a game plan,  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-reasons-hire-professional-blogger/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  professional bloggers </a>  enlisted to put down just the right words, consistent scheduling to create a predictable posting pattern, and appropriate follow-up to ensure all comments are responded to and all hot topics are re-visited in future posts. Carefully decide upon topics and keywords for each post, but also do not lose sight of the larger picture and what you wish to achieve. Each post should be a step closer to your overarching goals.  <u>  <a href=\"http://pegfitzpatrick.com/how-to-get-organized-with-an-editorial-calendar-its-easier-than-you-think/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn how to create an editorial calendar here  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  3. Develop a cross-platform campaign. </strong></p><p> What do you want people to DO? While your primary goal should be providing information that is interesting to readers, you still must have an end game in mind. A truly interested reader will want to move naturally to the &ldquo;next step.&rdquo; If they can&rsquo;t take that step with you, they&rsquo;ll take it somewhere else. Decide what you want your call-to-action to be &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s to contact you for more information, sign up for a newsletter, take advantage of a special promotion, or take part in a viral campaign. Use this message consistently across Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, blog posts, and websites. You also want your logo, color scheme, fonts, and graphics to remain consistent across platform for a better branding experience.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mg-soc-media-rules.jpg\" width=\"969\"/></p><p> <strong>  4. Mix it up to engage followers. </strong></p><p> The 70-30 rule strategy says to maintain 70% fun, useful content and 30% promotional, action-oriented posts. Involve your audience in the conversation by asking for their participation from time to time. Social media channels are always tinkering with which sort of posts they allow a greater reach &mdash; be it text only, text plus image,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/217813/facebook-reduces-reach-of-brands-text-only-posts.html?edition=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   image only  </a> </u> , text plus URL&hellip; so it is best to vary up your posts to cover all bases. Incorporate infographics, quotes, Q&amp;A, or posts designed to get shares. There are countless strategies for driving more engagement with your posts, but check out what  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/shared-the-most-on-facebook/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kissmetrics  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://jcsocialmarketing.com/2014/08/6-proven-methods-get-social-media-shares/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Julia Claire Campbell  </a> </u>  have to say on this topic.</p><p> <strong>  5. Check your analytics. </strong></p><p> Not everyone truly enjoys the nitty gritty, but research is a MUST if you want your social media marketing to have any meaning for your company. There are tons of tools out there to make this work easier, but many people start with what is offered through the social media sites themselves and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Analytics  </a> </u> . Bigger companies typically outsource this &ldquo;grunt work&rdquo; and allow the final reports to dictate their next moves, without getting too bogged down in the details. Firms like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mod Girl Marketing  </a> </u>  specialize in Google Analytics reporting to help large companies see exactly where their marketing and advertising dollars are going. Essentially, you need to know: What type of content and keywords are working? What is not working? What topics lead to your desired goals?</p><p> <strong>  6. Keep a pulse on trending topics. </strong></p><p> Creating your editorial calendar around holidays and special events is a sound strategy, but you also want a little bit of flexibility to capitalize on hot topics that everyone is buzzing about on social media. Check Yahoo and Twitter for trending topics and keywords. Look up your top industry keywords on  <u>  <a href=\"https://news.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google News  </a> </u>  to see what others are discussing. Make sure you are at least aware. Attend industry events to get ahead of the curve and predict what people will want to know about in the near future. Getting there first can be an advantage when you&rsquo;re looking to be seen as a leader in your field that people can trust for the latest information.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1048\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mg-dos-donts-social-media-infographic.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p> <strong>  7. Remain flexible. </strong></p><p> Remember, social media is not something you can set and forget. It&rsquo;s constantly evolving.

    "title": "One Reason Why “Referrals\" Are the Dominant Source of New Clients for Financial Advisors",
    "link": "one-reason-why-referrals-are-the-dominant-source-of-new-clients-for-financial-advisors",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.evolutionizemypractice.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cliff Campeau  </a> </u></p><p> We&rsquo;re all familiar with the statistics regarding the dominant role of &ldquo;referrals&rdquo; when it comes to client acquisition for Financial Advisors (FAs). Whether such referrals emanate from clients, strategic alliances or institutional partners, they are and have been the number one source of new clients for FAs for decades.  </p><p> Without belittling the importance of referrals, one might ask the question; &ldquo;Is referral marketing that powerful? Or is it the fact that a majority of independent FAs do little else to market their firms, thus indirectly propelling referral marketing to the top of the heap when it comes to client acquisition?&rdquo; There is clear evidence to suggest that the latter is likely the case. </p><p> Consider that a high-percentage of firms don&rsquo;t engage in business planning, let alone go through a formal marketing planning process.  In 2011, Multi-Financial Securities Corporation conducted an advisor benchmarking study which found that among all advisors surveyed; </p><li> 40.2% did not have a documented business plan </li><li> 38.2% had only a partially documented business plan </li><p> Thus it comes as little surprise when we consider FA Insights 2014 bi-annual &ldquo;Growth by Design&rdquo; research study, which found that only 43% of the survey&rsquo;s participants identified business development activities as a &ldquo;primary factor&rdquo; in achieving their growth. This finding prompted the following observation from the research team; &ldquo;All too often, firms passively rely on client referrals and market tailwinds to mask their lack of bona fide marketing capabilities.&rdquo; </p><p> The obvious question to be raised is; &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t more advisors made a concerted effort to embrace marketing as a bona fide means of developing their practices?&rdquo; Is it because those advisors aren&rsquo;t committed to growth? Do they doubt the efficacy of marketing and its role in distinguishing and growing their firms?  Or do they simply lack the knowledge required to formalize a practice development program? </p><p> In our Advisor Marketing practice, we have found the latter to be a primary inhibitor to firms conceiving of, funding and implementing marketing programs to support their growth objectives. However, few firms are willing to acknowledge that they don&rsquo;t have the requisite experience or core competencies in this area represented within the firm. Often times, when queried these firms will offer a range of reasons to support their lack of a tangible marketing program rather than simply stating that that they need assistance in this area. </p><p> The irony is that for an industry, which has come to rely so heavily on referrals, study after study have shown that advisors as a whole haven&rsquo;t even fully embraced this important marketing tactic. In a study released in July, 2014 by SEI, Scorpio Partnership and NPG Wealth Management it was determined that &ldquo;47% of investors surveyed said that they would actively refer&rdquo; prospects to their advisors and another 47% would do the same &ldquo;if prompted.&rdquo;  Yet, the survey found that less than one-third of respondents &ldquo;reported being asked by their wealth managers at least once a quarter&rdquo; for a referral. </p><p> This lack of marketing acumen represents a risk for advisors seeking to achieve sustainable growth, but it is not an insurmountable challenge. As the noted twentieth century author, inventor and consultant, Edward de Bono once intoned: </p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way.&rdquo;  </strong></p><p> One of the most expedient and efficient ways to break out of an established pattern would be to engage an independent marketing consultant to help guide the firm&rsquo;s efforts in this area. For an industry that is rife with choices, distinguishing one&rsquo;s firm for competitive advantage is a pre-requisite for client acquisition. According to Envestnet&rsquo;s 2014 &ldquo;Compendium of Industry Trends&rdquo; report, there are over 300,000 advisors active today. While the number of advisors has been contracting over the course of the last several years, a 1.0% to 2.0% annual attrition rate doesn&rsquo;t demonstrably reduce the level of competition for investors. </p><p> Marketing is a process, not a silver bullet.  To be effective in this area requires patience, consistency and, yes, investment spending for firms to achieve their positioning and growth objectives. Part of the reason for this is the consideration process which investors go through when considering an advisor. </p><p> Advisor Impact recently released findings from their &ldquo;Economics of Loyalty Survey&rdquo; which identified that the following items most influenced investors&rsquo; decisions to work with an advisor: </p><p> <strong>  Influencing Factors / % of Respondents  </strong></p><li> Demonstrated that they understood my needs (69%)</li><li> Helped me understand the value they could bring (57%)</li><li> Educated me about investing  (45%)  <br/>  </li><p> It should be noted that the aforementioned factors considered by consumers prior to selecting an advisor reinforce the fact that this is not a one-meeting close industry. Advisors must earn the trust of prospects, regardless of the source of a lead, establishing a relationship prior to being able to convert those prospects to clients.  </p><p> A well conceived marketing communications program can greatly assist in both developing and maintaining meaningful relationships from the point of initial contact between an investor and the firm and over the course of what can be a long and mutually beneficial relationship.</p>",

    "link": "forget-rebranding-try-unbranding-6-exercises-for-unbranding",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Marilyn Cox </u></p><p> Last night I served bacon, eggs, and fruit for dinner. My children were shocked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have breakfast for dinner!&rdquo; I tried to explain that breakfast, lunch, and dinner were defined by the time of day you consume food, not the type of food you&rsquo;re consuming. Of course, over time eggs and bacon have been classified as breakfast, sandwiches are for lunchtime, and spaghetti is preferred at dinner time. We&rsquo;ve branded food based on habit. But here&rsquo;s something interesting, my son always passes on scrambled eggs at breakfast time, but he gobbled them up at dinner. I didn&rsquo;t reclassify them as a dinner food, simply &ldquo;these are eggs and we&rsquo;re eating them for dinner&rdquo;. I unbranded the food.</p><p> <strong>  Rebranding vs. Unbranding </strong> <br/> <br/> Many tenured companies are working through rebranding exercises. They want to shake off the image of an out-of-touch company, or perhaps a tarnished reputation. They begin to explore new messaging, tone of voice, and logo changes. It&rsquo;s important to point out that your brand is more than a logo and corporate color scheme. A brand is the idea or image of a specific product or service that consumers connect with, and yet many companies don&rsquo;t work to understand what their audience&rsquo;s perception is of the existing brand.</p><p> <strong>  But perhaps rebranding isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s needed. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ve noticed a trend in many regulated industries to unbrand their content. Let&rsquo;s look at the pharmaceutical space. In order for pharma companies to effectively sell into the health care provider space they must enable and educate HCPs. HCPs want access to information, key opinion leaders, and peers.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/sales-force-report-shadowing-the-reps/article/265321/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HCPs cited journals as their top info source, with 64%-68% reading about new products in journals three or more times per month, followed by colleagues (52%-53%), websites like Epocrates, Medscape and UptoDate (46%-52%), apps (27%-32%) and package inserts (25%-29%). Similar numbers were seen for learning about established products  </a> </u> . Traditionally, HCPs have not trusted the content they&rsquo;ve received from pharmaceutical companies. Because of this, pharma organizations are now investing in the development of unbranded sites, content, and communities. These unbranded sites aren&rsquo;t designed to be deceptive, rather to demonstrate that these pharmaceutical companies are more than the pill offered and very much a part of the wellness process. They&rsquo;re focused on developing content that promotes healthy living, educates the audience about disease awareness, and stresses the importance of medication adherence.</p><p> <strong>  An Unbranding Case Study </strong> <br/> <br/> Merck is a great example of a company that has seen success with unbranding. Merck partnered with PatientsLikeMe to focus on community building. This was an effort to test how a new kind of online evidence network could inform drug development using real-world health outcomes in psoriasis, the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the US. Merck had 2 goals, to provide a tool to help improve patients&rsquo; lives, and to gain knowledge about symptoms, self care, and the lives of patients over time to more clearly discern how people use medications with a goal towards informing the development of future treatment. Using this unbranded initiative they accomplished both objectives. They drove greater patient support and resources for those patients. They also learned that insomnia was a common issue for those with psoriasis and could now work to overcome those challenges.</p><p> <strong>  6 Exercises for Unbranding </strong> <br/> <br/> So how do you unbrand? Just like rebranding isn&rsquo;t simply changing the logo, unbranding isn&rsquo;t just removing the logo. Below are 6 things to consider when unbranding your content.</p><p> 1. If you remove the company logo, would companies recognize a corporate tone in the content, or a personal and relatable voice? Would the content provide a unique point of view, or sound like every other thing published on that topic?</p><p> 2. If you placed your content in the middle of magazine, would it read like an advertisement, a best practices how-to article, or a thought leadership editorial?</p><p> 3. If you remove the product name from case studies, does they story explain how the customer overcame challenges? Is the customer effort, or the product functionality the focus of the story?</p><p> 4. When evaluating graphics used in your content, what percentage are corporate logos and product pictures, what percentage are stock photography, what percentage are infographics, and what percentage are of real customers and employees?</p><p> 5. If you remove the corporate header does the content demonstrate validity? Do you support positioning with 3rd party data?</p><p> 6. After engaging with your content, has the audience learned something of value that impacts their business, or have they learned about your products? Is your audience better off for having read your content?</p><p> <strong>  Unbranding allows organizations to push past layers of mistrust to deliver helpful information. </strong> Unbranding also provides the audience with the long term sustenance required in longer sales cycles. By stripping away the corporate artifices companies can really begin to demonstrate their investment in customers. In short, the bulk of your efforts should be channeled into creating content that contains value. What unbranding considerations would you add?</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you haven&rsquo;t recognized the surge of conversations and bickering about race lately you have either been ignoring it or have living under a rock. For most people, having a discussion about race relations is the equivalent to standing in a public place with twenty people where there is a remarkable stench, but no one wants to be the one to say aloud that the room stinks. Talking about race stinks, but it has to be done.</p><p> Despite the front-page awareness brought by the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO and Eric Gardner in Staten Island, NY, there&rsquo;s one place that has yet to directly embrace the discussion.</p><h3> The workplace.</h3><p> <br/> For all the sensitivity training mandated by corporate Human Resources with their PowerPoint decks and contrived &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we all just get along&rdquo; group exercises, practically all diversity and inclusion sessions can be boiled down to lyrical statements such as these from the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.diversity.va.gov/training/files/diversity-inclusion-in-va.ppt\" target=\"_blank\">   Diversity and Inclusion in the VA Workforce  </a> </u>  presentation from Department of Veterans Affairs:</p><p> Diversity is the mosaic of people who bring a variety of backgrounds, styles, perspectives, values and beliefs as assets to the groups and organizations with which they interact</p><p> The &ldquo;melting pot&rdquo; theory of American society has evolved, instead consider a vegetable soup metaphor</p><p> Members of various cultural groups may not want to be assimilated, they want their tastes, looks and texture to remain whole.</p><p> These present a sanitized and easy-to-deliver message that diversity and inclusion can be learned by all employees in a few hours.</p><p> Yet they never mention the phrase, Race Relations.</p><p> In some instances, participants are even asked to shout out words and phrases that further marginalize the recipients, like:</p><p> Jews are great with money; Blacks are great at sports.</p><h3> Feel better now? Great, now get back to work and make some money you silly goose&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The bigger question is where has all of our diversity and inclusion training gotten us? As HR people, have we had the truly difficult conversations surrounding race or have we just chosen to do what&rsquo;s comfortable for everyone involved &ndash; the 50% solution?</p><p> I can comfortably say we have done the latter. We&rsquo;d much rather have employees overhear the whispers in cubicles or the clandestine rumblings about race at the water cooler than to have an open and honest discussion in the context of our corporate mission and values.</p><p> When we speak about diversity and inclusion in the workplace, we usually give it the backdrop of tolerance. We can&rsquo;t make people love one another but is tolerance of one another enough? Our sentiment is that just as parents teach their kids about racism so does a company &ldquo;teach&rdquo; its employees how to treat those from other races within the company.</p><p> However, you can&rsquo;t have bigots &ldquo;protectively&rdquo; draped in the veil of Human Resources prancing around your organization. It doesn&rsquo;t work to insulate racially insensitive behavior because as we are witnessing, racism always manages to rear its ugly head. Take  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/11/a-sony-exec-cracks-jokes-about-obamas-race-and-eight-more-bruising-revelations-from-the-sony-leak/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sony Pictures  </a> </u> : None of those fools saw a hacking of their emails coming and so they happily cracked racial jokes about the President of the United States along with bashing other notable artists. Where was HR?</p><p> It will be interesting to see if and how their HR department deals with the racial joking in the context of any policies they have on the books. The likely scenario will be that the public will play the role of HR and &ldquo;force&rdquo; Amy Pascal to resign because the public remedy of chopping off the head of the stinking fish &ndash; at the expense of fixing the deeper reason for the stench &ndash; carries more weight to company &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; than addressing the issue as a violation of a company policy which of course is predicated on the presence of an actual company policy that deals with racially charged actions.</p><p> Working in HR, we have found out that policies stating that there is &ldquo;Zero Tolerance&rdquo; for discrimination and/or racist discussion in the workplace are bull. While most companies have them to cover their behinds, HR issues such as internal inequity run rampant  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2013/03/20/the-other-pay-gap-why-minorities-are-still-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">   with minorities   </a>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2013/03/20/the-other-pay-gap-why-minorities-are-still-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">   making disproportionately less money than their white counterparts  </a> </u>  (want more? search for &ldquo;do minorities earn less&rdquo;). Zero Tolerance policies notwithstanding, employees in general are free to spew their racial epithets company-wide, because they can without any significant repercussions. Heck, kindergarten children who point &ldquo;finger guns&rdquo; at other classmates are suspended more frequently than employees sending around racially-insensitive emails!</p><p> We have a major issue in the US around race and it has been fermenting in business and the workforce for a long time. You can thank race relations for your EEO-1 reports, for your Affirmative Action Plans, and for all the data you have to collect to prove your applicant pools have adequate ethnic and racial representation.</p><h3> The world is laughing at us.</h3><p> <br/> As our colleague and friend, Ron Thomas recently said in his article  <a href=\"http://strategyfocusedhr.blogspot.ae/2014/12/breathe-deep.html?m=1via\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Breathe Deep  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  about the world&rsquo;s view of business and HR: &ldquo;Every race imaginable, every language imaginable and everyone is too busy with their lives to get caught up in this racial mindset. We are too busy doing business to get caught up in this US kind of thing.&rdquo; His point-of-view is framed by his relationships with business leaders in Dubai where he currently lives and works.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s a thought&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> If it is explicit (meaning in policy and action) that racism and/or discrimination will not be the basis for any business decision in company &ldquo;X&rdquo;, employees have three choices, (1) they can resign and find a company where their bigoted ideas are supported; (2) they will act accordingly and ensure that all people are treated fairly; (3) or they will be fired. Zero Tolerance should really mean Zero Tolerance.</p><p> However, anti-racism policies alone are not sufficient to solve the core problem. The real issues are Action and Accountability. Given the events of gross police misconduct in Ferguson, MO and on Staten Island, NY, are HR and C-suite leadership any more encouraged to offer corporate solutions for addressing race relations in the workplace? It is important to throw both company leadership and HR out in front because it stands to reason that the current model of HR wouldn&rsquo;t write a policy or create education that will change this racial trajectory if it isn&rsquo;t supported by leadership.</p><p> Much of the undercurrent of annoyance and fury surrounding the recent killings of black men in the media are not just about the killings, but how it is rooted in a build up of injustices felt in every corner of society by every category of a workplace EEO-1 report. Monochromatic leadership with monochromatic workforce planning when combined with the fear or inability to discuss complex socio-economic issues has led to an uneven playing field when it comes to the differences of upward mobility and opportunity for both whites and blacks.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve steered clear of the word minorities as it is an all-encompassing &ldquo;safe word&rdquo; that frankly allows us in HR to downplay the impact our policies, procedures and ideals have on specific groups of people. With Diversity and Inclusion training, task forces, affinity groups, and even people of color on Boards of Directors, it sure sounds like we&rsquo;re being inclusive when in reality the sanitization and compartmentalization produces even further misunderstanding and pushes conversation farther back into the closet.</p><p> Both of us have very strong ties to law enforcement; we&rsquo;re quite aware that the job is dangerous and we do worry about our friends and family coming home every evening. We also know how hard-working, conscientious, and fair most of them are. It&rsquo;s a small percentage of police officers who cross the lines into racist action, much in the same way we suspect that a similar percentage of companies create a culture of racism with divisive C-level leadership and non-existent HR oversight.</p><p> While &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; have created the problem, within the workplace, HR should have the knowledge, influence, and ability to change the deeply ingrained culture that is responsible for enabling the racism. Our thesis is that racism in the workplace continues to undermine the very purpose for why we exist in organizations and in so many instances HR has taken the easy way out.</p><h3> It is time for a change.</h3><p> <br/> When the death of black men in Ferguson, MO, on Staten Island, and in stairwells takes place so easily, then it really does become time not for a national discussion of race in America but a national call to action and change of culture. Surely we&rsquo;re not naive to believe that either discussion or action will eliminate bigotry but since we&rsquo;re in a profession that purportedly cares about the workplace, it is time to mobilize a new Human Resources to create new deliverables about Race Relations.</p><p> The workplace is not a community that sits on an island cordoned off from society but is in fact a microcosm of society. HR has failed either by fear, ignorance, or some bizarre take on professionalism to address racism in the workplace. If employees are the heartbeat of the company, then for certain HR is the pacemaker &ndash; and it&rsquo;s time for some serious surgery.</p><p> People are now marching on the streets across the country &ndash; and it&rsquo;s calling attention to racism in America but it&rsquo;s time for HR to march into boardrooms. It&rsquo;s time for HR to lead the discussion on racism at work, not as means for attaining a certificate of completion for diversity training but with a goal of creating a culture and all the necessary elements to root out racism in the workplace. It&rsquo;s time for HR to look its recruiting and retention practices to see if we&rsquo;re &ldquo;bringing&rdquo; racism into the workplace with bad hiring and &ldquo;promoting&rdquo; racism with bad management.</p><p> If all this talk about racism makes you uncomfortable to think or speak about, think of your &ldquo;valued&rdquo; employees who endure these racially-charged emails, water cooler jokes, and I-know-why-you&rsquo;re-here smirks because you failed to create a culture that supports the value they bring to your company. If your talent chooses to leave or you can&rsquo;t attract the best and the brightest because your company&rsquo;s HR policies, procedures, and people aren&rsquo;t fair and supportive, do you know what that makes you?</p><h3> Unemployed.</h3><p> <br/> Disclaimer: This post was co-written by Steve Levy of the uber awesome,  <u>  <a href=\"http://recruitinginferno.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Recruiting Inferno  </a> </u>  blog and Janine Truitt, Chief Innovations Officer of  <a href=\"http://talentthinkinnovations.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  T  <u>   alent Think Innovations, LLC  </u> </a>  and Founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://thearistocracyofhr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Aristocracy of HR  </a> </u> .</p>",

These people can&rsquo;t be acquired somewhere else. And, 80% of the reason someone chooses your firm is because of you &ndash; not your products.

    "title": "The 5 Qualities of Highly Successful People",
    "link": "the-5-qualities-of-highly-successful-people",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbyGreer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Rob Greer  </u> </a> One of the greatest and most debilitating misconceptions of our society today is the belief that  <u>  <a href=\"https://financebuzz.com/5-signs-you-will-become-millionaire\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   success  </a> </u>  is this elusive concept that only a few lucky souls have the capability of achieving. This couldn&rsquo;t be more untrue. I have witnessed first-hand the paralyzing (or uplifting) effects of this belief (or disbelief) and have segmented it into three defining categories of people:1) Those who employ this belief as rationalization for their laziness and lack on ambition. This is perhaps the most confining category and hardest to rectify, but it is certainly not unachievable.2) Those who genuinely believe it because it has been spoon-fed to them their entire lives. Yes, it is unsettling and cyclical, but it only takes one individual to disrupt the pattern, aka YOU.3) Those who are cognizant of the belief and its effects but choose not to internalize it. These are your Bill Gates&rsquo;, Steve Jobs&rsquo;, Richard Branson&rsquo;s; the ones that have a remarkable and lasting impact on the world.Category 3 is obviously where you &ndash; hopefully &ndash; want to be, but the question is how exactly to arrive at this &ldquo;enviable&rdquo; place. For one, you need to recognize the universal presence of this belief, for it envelops virtually all of us (Bill, Steve, Richard, and the like, this excludes you). It takes its form in every instance of mediocrity, stagnation, and apathy. Rather than simply ignore it, acknowledge it and use it as a stepping-stone to your aspirations and goals.The following are attributes characteristic of the people who disbelieve this concept, aka &ldquo;The Highly Successful&rdquo;. See how this list relates to your personal qualities, and be brutally honest with yourself. You will notice both parallels and discrepancies. Focus on the latter, because these are the core hindrances of your success. Work on them, battle with them, eventually defeat them, and you will be well on your way to entering the domain of category 3. <strong>  1) CHARISMA </strong> The &ldquo;who the hell is that&rdquo; effect when someone walks in the room. This is the main characteristic of &ldquo;that&rdquo; person whose magnetism invariably lights up any social situation.  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/sims-wyeth/charisma-how-to-be-more-likeable.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Charisma </a>  is integral to success in virtually any context. It involves 3 core elements: Presence, Warmth, and Power. <strong>  2) DRIVE </strong> Those who possess drive have this &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-smith-my-work-ethic-is-sickening/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ridiculous, sickening  </a> </u> &rdquo; work ethic. This is the quality that fuels the fire of ambition. It allows individuals to outwork their peers and be successful. <strong>  3) OPTIMISM </strong> Optimism is the strategy for creating a brilliant future. Those who possess it dwell in possibility. They don&rsquo;t consume themselves with all that has been forgone, but rather everything that is still left to be achieved. I am a firm believer that irrational optimism is better than rational pessimism. <strong>  4) TIME MASTERY </strong> Successful people are successful because they get a lot done. Those who get the most done make the most of the allotted 24 hours a day we all get; it is all about efficiency. Time is the ultimate currency, and those who realize this are able to place a monetary value on their time and outsource anything that falls short of this stipulated value. <strong>  5) VISIONARY </strong> &ldquo; <u>  The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. </u> &rdquo; This is probably the most important characteristic of success, and those who possess it are unstoppable. These are the people who see their own vision of the future and just make it happen through sheer brilliance and imagination.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In 1998 I lost an opportunity to help a company manage their 401k plan because the fees on the American Funds platform (only offered A-shares at the time), were way more expensive than the free (hidden) fees offered by the other advisor competing for the business (or so the investment committee was led to believe).</p><p> &ldquo;Price is only an issue in the absence of value.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve heard that quote (no attribution found) many times before and it wasn&rsquo;t until I got the call in 1998 telling me I did not win the business that I realized what that quote actually meant to me.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Maybe the reason it seems that price is all your customers care about is . . . that you haven&rsquo;t given them anything else to care about.&rdquo; ~ Seth Godin </strong></p><p> If you want to stop competing on fees (and funds and fiduciary status), you must be able to identify the value you actually bring to the table and clearly articulate in a way that helps plan sponsors understand why they&rsquo;d want to hire you (as opposed to a product or vendor you might be able to represent).</p><p> <strong>  One: Specialize and advertise. </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;ve been working in the qualified plan space for any length of time you understand how complex ERISA and 401k plan management compliance can get. Specialization is important to your ability to service your plans properly, but is also a great way to differentiate yourself and show prospects that you are better equipped to help them than the advisor with no specialized training. In a survey I conducted (Financial Service Standards) a few years ago, 95% of plan sponsors said it was important that the advisor they work with have specialized retirement training. Get educated. Get a retirement-specific designation.  <u>  Download a free guide that lists 24 different retirement credentials </u>  and pick which one you will start with, then advertise it. Let plan sponsors know you&rsquo;re qualified to help them manage their plan and explain the importance of specialization in this complex area of the market.</p><p> <strong>  Two: Be very specific about who you serve. </strong></p><p> If you are the owner of a chiropractic office in Pittsburgh and the doctors in your practice want a self-directed option in their 401k plan, and I told you that &ldquo;I specialize in offering self-directed options for small medical practices in Pittsburgh&rdquo;, I would be exactly who you&rsquo;d want to work with over the advisor that says &ldquo;I work with companies whose plan size is between 2 and 10 million in assets.&rdquo; Think about it. Specialists make more than generalists and you bring true value when you can narrow your customer base to serve, exceptionally well, a specific demographic. Identify specifically who you will serve and you&rsquo;ll win a much higher percentage of cases when you start focusing on a specific client type rather than trying to accommodate anyone that might need help with their 401k plan.</p><p> <strong>  Three: Be clear on how you&rsquo;re different. </strong></p><p> In the book &ldquo;How to Get Your Competition Fired&rdquo; Randy Schwantz describes the three ways you can have a competitive advantage through differentiation. First, you can provide a service that is unique, that no one else provides. Second, you can provide a service that others provide, but you have a better process for it that gets better results. Or third, you can describe the service you offer in such a clear and compelling way that prospects are motivated to buy from you rather than from your competition. Identify what your competitive advantage is and articulate it a way that shows your prospects why and how it benefits them.</p><p> <strong>  Four: Make sure your unique value differentiator is front and center on your homepage. </strong></p><p> I can&rsquo;t tell you how many advisors have spent tons of money on their websites, and nowhere on their home page can a client actually learn the who, what and why of the firm (Who is this page about, what&rsquo;s in it for me, and why would I want to do business with this firm). Go to your website right now and put yourself in the shoes of your prospect and ask those three questions. Chances are you can tweak your homepage so your potential clients know they&rsquo;re right place and they&rsquo;ve found a solution to their unique situation, if you&rsquo;ve done a good job in identifying your target marketing and crafting your unique value proposition.</p><p> <strong>  Five: Use LinkedIn to attract your ideal client. </strong></p><p> LinkedIn can be so much more than a plain, boring business card if you use the features LinkedIn offers its members to your advantage. Make sure your summary explains your who, what and why (just like your home page). Give a clear call to action, such as &ldquo;download your free 10-point checklist on how to avoid the common 401k mistakes from my homepage at this link&rdquo;. Use the new publishing option to write about things your prospects and clients should pay attention to (while raising your visibility and credibility).</p><p> There are many ways that you can compete more effectively in the 401k market but they all begin with understanding the landscape and deciding on a focus for your business.</p><p> If you&rsquo;d like more strategies and tips for growing a successful and compliant 401k practices, you can download a free special report titled &ldquo;3 Steps to Developing a Marketing Strategy that Doesn&rsquo;t Suck&rdquo; on my blog at  <u>  <a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/free-resources\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://401kbestpractices.com/free-resources  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  Why do some goals fail? </strong></h3><p> Do you ever wonder why some New Year's resolutions die a long, slow death while others seem as easy to do as a simple checklist item? It comes down to science.</p><li> I want to teach you the science of goal-setting.</li><li> The research behind resolutions.</li><li> Our investigations for intentions.</li><p> There is a science to setting successful goals and it's not what you would think. In this post I want to talk about how to set your goals effectively and then proactively achieve them.</p><p> <strong>  Why Care?! </strong></p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scilogs.com/the_science_talent_project/goal-setting-for-scientifically-minded-people/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research  </a> </u>  is clear: People who set goals are more successful.</p><p> However, not all goals are created equal: Merely fantasizing about your goal is de-motivating-it actually tricks the brain into thinking you have already achieved it.</p><p> Goals that aren't set properly can end up having the opposite effect. How do you effectively go about setting and achieving your goals? Throw out everything you have ever heard about goals. This year I want you try:</p><p> *Science Based Goal Setting*</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-16-goalsetting-thumb.jpg\" width=\"520\"/></p><p> (Cue booming music and firework sound effects here.)</p><p> <strong>  Step #1: What's Your Emotional Temperature? </strong></p><p> Right now I want you to take your emotional temperature. On a piece of paper or on our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2014/12/science-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   downloadable goal setting worksheet  </a> </u>  rate the different areas of your life on a scale from one to five (one being extremely dissatisfied, five being extremely satisfied).</p><p> <strong>  *Business: </strong> How do you feel about your work, career or business effectiveness and success? <br/> <br/> <strong>  *Friends: </strong> How is your social life? Your friendships and support system? <br/> <br/> <strong>  *Family: </strong> How are your personal relationships? Your partner or spouse? <br/> <br/> <strong>  *Personal Passions: </strong> Do you have personal passion projects, hobbies or fun activities that fulfill you? <br/> <br/> <strong>  *Spiritual: </strong> You can interpret this one as you like. It could be your faith, mental health, personal journeys or mindset. <br/> <br/> <strong>  *Health: </strong> Are you happy with your physical health and wellness?</p><p> <strong>  This is called your Goal Wheel: </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-16-goalwheel-thumb.png\" width=\"570\"/></p><p> A finished Goal Wheel will have the lines filled in so you can see what your 'emotional temperature' is in each area.</p><p> Ninja Tip: I save all of my Goal Wheels and then check-in to see if there are any patterns. You can use these worksheets over and over again to see how far you have come from previous months or years depending on how often you do it.</p><p> <strong>  Step #2: Your Legacy </strong></p><p> In my courses I talk a lot about your legacy. What drives you. What gets you up in the morning. Before setting goals it is important to think about your big picture. Step #1 is about looking at where you are right now. Step #2 is all about looking at where you want to go. On a piece of paper or on our downloadable goal setting worksheet answer these three questions:</p><p> In 10 years, what do I want my life to look like? What do I want to be remembered for? What does success mean for me? Take your time and answer these questions well. This sets the stage for successful goal setting.</p><p> <strong>  Step #3: The Neurology of Ownership </strong></p><p> When we take ownership of something-an item, an idea or a goal, we are more committed to it. This is called the \" <u>  endowment effect </u> \" which happens when we take ownership of something and it becomes \"ours\", thereby integrating into our sense of identity.</p><p> Cornell University researchers showed the endowment effect with a clever experiment. First, researchers gave participants coffee mugs and offered to trade them chocolate for their mug. Almost none of the participants wanted to trade. Next, researchers reversed the trial. They gave students chocolate and asked them to trade for the coffee mugs. Again, very few wanted to trade. This is the endowment effect in action. It was about what they already had, not about the actual objects. When we take ownership of something we work to keep it.</p><p> Step three is about owning your intention. Look at your Goal Wheel and set an intention for that area-your sections that are 4s or 5s might just be about maintenance. Remember, these aren't specific goals yet, they are just intentions. This is going to help you own a different outcome for yourself in each area. Here are some examples:</p><p> <strong>  Business: </strong> Level up my business efforts so I can reach and help more people. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Friends: </strong> Set aside time to support and reach out to friends more regularly. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Family: </strong> See family more often and dedicate real time to connect and catch-up. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Personal Passions: </strong> Learn how to paint and spend more time reading. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Spiritual: </strong> Start meditating to create mental space and slow down at the end of a workday. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Health: </strong> Get more toned and increase my endurance. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Step #4: Outcome plus Process </strong></p><p> If I had to pick, I would say this is the most important step: This is why goals fail!</p><p> Most people set an intention or an ideal outcome and try to work towards it. That is great, but that is only half of the way there. I want you to pick an outcome and a process.</p><p> <strong>  Outcome: </strong> The ideal result, hopeful conclusion, best end for your goal. <br/> <strong>  Process: </strong> The skills you need, the method required to get you there.</p><p> Before I give you some examples, let me explain the science behind the Outcome + Process step. Researcher,  <u>  <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1997-07777-002\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Barry Zimmerman  </a> </u>  trained participants to throw darts. They split them up into three groups. Group #1 was told to simply get the highest score possible (outcome trial). Group #2 was told to optimize the process of being a good dart thrower by bringing their arm back, adjusting the angle of the throw and having a firm grip (process trial). Group #3 began with the process of throwing and then once they had mastered the skills were switched to focus on the outcome (process and outcome trial).</p><p> The participants with the outcome goals performed worst! The process and outcome trial participants got the highest scores by far.</p><p> Next to the intentions you set in step three, I want you to write the skills, process or methods you need to achieve those outcomes. For example:</p><p> <strong>  Business: </strong> Level up my business efforts so I can reach and help more people. <br/> Hire a marketing agency.</p><p> <strong>  Friends: </strong> Set aside time to support and reach out to friends more regularly. <br/> Join a class with friends. Plan a weekend getaway.</p><p> <strong>  Family: </strong> See family more often and dedicate real time to connect and catch-up. <br/> Plan a family reunion that happens on the same holidays each year.</p><p> <strong>  Personal Passions: </strong> Learn how to paint and spend more time reading. <br/> Buy a painting book. Get suggestions of 10 books from friends.</p><p> <strong>  Spiritual: </strong> Start meditating to create mental space and slow down at the end of a workday. <br/> Get a meditation app to remind me before bed.</p><p> <strong>  Health: </strong> Get more toned and increase my endurance. <br/> Buy a weight set and sign-up for a bootcamp.</p><p> <strong>  Step #5: MAC Daddy Goals </strong></p><p> Now we are getting somewhere! Next we want to make your intentions into goals. Not just goals-MAC Daddy Goals. In 2011,  <u>  <a href=\"http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/67333233/effect-goal-setting-group-performance-meta-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   researchers  </a> </u>  did a huge meta-analysis of 38 studies on goal setting. They found that there are patterns between goals that work and those that don't. I put this into the acronym MAC to make it easy to remember:</p><p> <strong>  Measurable: </strong> Your goals should be quantifiable. There should be a clear ending that can be measured.</p><p> <strong>  Actionable: </strong> You have to know exactly what you want and the process you need to get there (we did this already in step four).</p><p> <strong>  Competent: </strong> Your goals have to align with your legacy (step two) and be achievable. If you set yourself up for failure you curse your goal achievement attempts.</p><p> I want you to go through each area and set a measurable, actionable and competent goal. In this way you incorporate your process into your outcome. For example:</p><p> <strong>  Business: </strong> Hire a marketing agency by March to add 10,000 new subscribers and 5,000 new Twitter followers.</p><p> <strong>  Friends: </strong> Send five classes to friends to sign up together and get a weekend getaway on the calendar before this summer.</p><p> <strong>  Family: </strong> Plan a family reunion over Labor Day. Set bi-weekly call dates with sisters.</p><p> <strong>  Personal Passions: </strong> Buy a painting book. Get suggestions of 10 books from friends.</p><p> <strong>  Spiritual: </strong> Get a meditation app and set a reminder for 9pm each night.</p><p> <strong>  Health: </strong> Order a weight set and buy a 12 class bootcamp package.</p><p> <strong>  Step #6: Stop Reading </strong></p><p> There is a reason we have a  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2014/12/science-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   free downloadable worksheet  </u>    </a> and I keep telling you to fill it out. Writing down your goals and steps is an essential part of the achievement process. When you write down your goals it triggers a different part of the brain, helps ownership (Step #3) and keeps you more accountable. I don't care if you use our worksheet, your notebook or a word doc-write them down!</p><p> <strong>  Step #7: Identify Blockers </strong></p><p> When we first set our goals we are super optimistic and filled with hope-and that's great. One thing that happens, however, is we fail to identify possible blockers. I want you to get real with yourself for a moment and answer these questions in your Goal Worksheet:</p><li> What logistical constraints might make it difficult for you achieve your goals?</li><li> What behaviors might make it difficult for you to achieve your goals?</li><li> Who might make it difficult for you to achieve your goals?</li><p> This can be anything from financial constraints to unsupportive family members to procrastination. Get real! When we know what your blockers are we can work to plan around them.</p><p> For example, one of my goals for next year is to read more. I know that if I don't have accountability to read I just won't get it done. I push it off, go to sleep, turn on Netflix, you know the drill. So, I started a Science of People Book Club to read with my readers. This way I have to post discussion questions and hear what you have to say while I read-this makes me want to read even more!</p><p> Check out our free and fun to join our  <u>  <a href=\"http://discuss.scienceofpeople.com/c/book-club\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Book Club  </a> </u> . We just selected our next book! (Thanks for helping keep me accountable). <br/> <br/> <strong>  Step #8: Make Your Map </strong></p><p> When I read this study on goal-setting I laughed out loud because I realized how simple it can be to engineer our goals for success:</p><p> <u>  Researchers </u>  wanted to see if they could get more students to get their tetanus vaccinations. So they printed up two different leaflets and measured the success of each one. The first had scientific explanations on why students should get vaccinated. The second had gruesome pictures of the effects of tetanus. Neither worked.</p><p> They made one more trial. They added a map to the leaflet showing the location of the campus' health center and its opening hours. THIS trial worked like magic. Why? The researchers added process and steps on exactly how to get the desired outcome.</p><p> Now it's time to make your map. In your Goals Worksheet add the steps you need to take to achieve your goal. These can be as small as sending someone an email-in fact the smaller the better. If you can keep your steps to under 10 minutes that's the best! You can always find 10 minutes.</p><p> Once you have broken your goal up into 10 minute segments for success, I want you to schedule them into your calendar.</p><p> Set calendar alerts, phone alerts, put post-its up, make a big white board to do list for the month. Schedule your steps into your life.</p><p> <strong>  Step #9: Get Accountability </strong></p><p> Feedback and accountability will supercharge your goals. Here are some ideas for accountability:</p><p> Post on your social networks about your goals to get public accountability. Why wait?  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vvanedwards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tweet me right now  </u>  . </a></p><p> Get a goal partner and set up times to talk or text every few weeks about your goals.</p><p> Join Stickk.com and set up financial stakes for your goals.</p><p> Make an <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/awesome-club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   awesome club  </u>    </a> and use the power of groups to achieve your goals and conquer blockers.</p><p> Change your passwords to remind you of your goals. For example, \"LevelUp2015&Prime; or \"20lbs2015&Prime;</p><p> Write a response to this post in our  <u>  <a href=\"http://discuss.scienceofpeople.com/t/your-goals-for-2015/257\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Goal Forum  </a> </u>  and get accountability from other Science of People Tribe members!</p><p> <strong>  #10: Revise, Practice, Revise </strong></p><p> This is a new way to think about goals-they are always a work in progress until they are achieved. Don't be afraid to revise your goals as you go. Maybe you thought that a family reunion was possible this summer but a cousin just planned her wedding in a far off destination. Revise the goal for a winter getaway! Check in with your goal worksheet every few weeks. Leave it pinned up next to your desk so you can easily access it to revise and update it. As you revise you learn about yourself, you reinvigorate your goal and set yourself up for more MAC Daddy goals next year.</p><p> <strong>  Bonus: What's Your Theme? </strong></p><p> One thing I like to do is think about a theme for the year. Last year was the year of learning. My theme for 2015 is all about application-applying all the amazing learning and experimenting from last year to level up my business and relationships. I love thinking about a theme because it centers you in your decisions. Look at your Goal Worksheet and try to find a theme.</p><p> OK, this is it. Time for action. Right now:</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2014/12/science-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fill out your Goal Worksheet.  </a> </u></p><p> I'm not sure what your goals are, but if we can help:  <a href=\"http://discuss.scienceofpeople.com/t/your-goals-for-2015/257\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tell me  </u>    </a> what your theme for 2014 was and what you are thinking about for 2015!</p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  As a child, I loved taking risks. Growing up around rattlesnakes, barbed wire fences, and frisky horses that liked to kick the saddle out of my hands, there was very little I thought I couldn&rsquo;t do. </strong></p><p> The key was putting my mind to it.</p><p> With age comes wisdom&mdash;or so I thought. As an adult, I was less amenable to taking risk. I was very strategic about relationships, careers, and spiritual formation. And I realize that there is a place for strategy, as long as it does not make your thinking soft.</p><p> Soft thinking is the opposite of mental toughness. If you suffer from soft thinking, you are afraid of seizing opportunities because you are afraid that your emotions, thoughts, or behavior might spin out of control&mdash;or, you are afraid to leave your comfort zone.</p><p> As it turns out, the key to managing risk is still in our mind.</p><p> There is no way to sugar-coat it&mdash;you&rsquo;re afraid of risk and don&rsquo;t seize the opportunities in your life because you don&rsquo;t:</p><p> <strong>  1. EMBRACE A LITTLE TERROR IN YOUR LIFE </strong></p><p> Strong minds seize opportunities because they allow themselves to be terrified&mdash;quite often. As a result, terror is a feeling that they are familiar with.</p><p> If you continually place yourself in situations where there is a little risk involved and the outcome is not known, your comfort zone is stretched.</p><p> Our brain likes to feel comfortable and seeks pleasure over pain. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re tempted to abandon ship at the first sign of distress.</p><p> <a href=\"http://dirkbergemann.commons.yale.edu/files/kahnemann-1984-choices-values-frames.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Our desire to avoid losses is almost twice as powerful as our desire to take a risk  </u>  . </a>  This explains why we often walk away or fail to recognize new opportunities.</p><p> If you start your day without feeling a little terror from the challenges before you, you&rsquo;re not pushing yourself hard enough.</p><p> <strong>  2. THINK FAST ENOUGH TO MOVE AHEAD OF THE HERD </strong></p><p> Strong minds seize opportunities because their minds are agile and flexible.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418337160&amp;sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Thinking fast is automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, and subconscious  </a> </u> . It means we can throw out long debates in favor of snap judgments and hard-wired rules of thumb that have served us well in the past.</p><p> Thinking fast is driven by your past experiences and memories. If you move into your discomfort zone on a regular basis, you frequently experience doses of terror and uncertainty. As a result, your mind does not get mired down with fear when new opportunities present themselves.</p><p> Fast thinking is efficient and effective, and essential if we want to seize opportunities in the fast-moving world of life and business.</p><p> <strong>  3. THINK FORWARD WITH CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION </strong></p><p> Strong minds seize opportunities because they do not allow themselves to get stuck in a rut.</p><p> In business and life, the comfort zone has never been a good place to be. It may feel comfortable but then we face another kind of risk: one of being irrelevant, obsolete&mdash;and extinct.</p><p> If you plan to think forward, you will need to continually question conventional wisdom, reinvent your work, and welcome disruptive innovation.</p><p> In short, you will need to live in a petri dish in which you are continually experimenting with new ideas and maneuvering in a perpetual zone of distress and uncertainty&mdash;and sometimes, even embarrassment.</p><p> <strong>  4. MOVE ON FROM THE PAST </strong></p><p> Strong minds seize opportunities because they learn from their past mistakes so they don&rsquo;t repeat them.</p><p> Our ability to think fast and think forward is determined by our brain, and our past behavior.</p><p> As children, our brains were flexible, creative, and unpredictable. As adults, however, our brain becomes more rigid&mdash;anything with unvaried repetition like careers, cultural activities, and skills all lead to rigidity.</p><p> Once we make the same decision a second or third time, a habit is formed, and one that becomes quite inflexible.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Brain-That-Changes-Itself/dp/067003830X/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418342575&amp;sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Rigid patterns of thinking tend to become self-sustaining over time  </u>  . </a>  Habits of behavior produced from past failure is not the same thing as learning from a mistake.</p><p> Habits are often a default reaction that leads to rigid thinking; learning, on the other hand, requires a flexible mindset that is always collecting and processing new information.</p><p> Often, we are not aware of these rigid patterns of thinking until we pinpoint their genesis in our memory. At that point, we recognize them for what they are and are able to move on from them.</p><p> Turn your ghosts into ancestors.</p><p> <strong>  5. FEED YOUR CURIOSITY </strong></p><p> Strong minds seize opportunities because they are always looking for new things to do, and once they are engaged, they turn their full attention to it.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Merzenich\" target=\"_blank\">   Researchers  </a> </u>  have found that curiosity is the single necessary condition for creating a flexible and agile mind.</p><p> When we are curious, we are engaged. Giving a subject our full attention and concentration is important if we want our brain to be more flexible and agile. It&rsquo;s also important that, once we thoroughly understand a subject, we move on to something else.</p><p> To keep the brain fit, we must learn something new, rather than simply replaying already-mastered skills.</p><p> The important thing is not to stop questioning. Never lose a holy curiosity&mdash;Albert Einstein</p><p> How have you taken a risk and seized an opportunity?</p> ",

    "content": "<p> Do you feel like you&rsquo;re caught between a rock and an ergonomically incorrect office chair?</p><p> If you can&rsquo;t seem to find joy in the workplace, it&rsquo;s easy to blame the job, the people, or the culture.  On some level, most of us believe that making money and enjoying our job are mutually exclusive. And if you decide that&rsquo;s true, you&rsquo;re probably right. But, if you decide it isn&rsquo;t true, you&rsquo;re also right.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re feeling stuck at your job, you&rsquo;re likely rationalizing it by saying:</p><li> &ldquo;I need to support my family.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to change my lifestyle.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to start from scratch.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> And while I certainly don&rsquo;t advise feeding your kids canned beans for the next 6 months, I question whether <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amita-patel/success-and-motivation_b_4908713.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  your version of &ldquo;success&rdquo; </a>  is worth the empty feeling inside. We often think that financial success will provide fulfillment when the opposite is actually true. Fulfillment yields success. Because what you&rsquo;re chasing isn&rsquo;t the money, it&rsquo;s the feeling that money gives you.</p><p> And make no mistake, I am not advising you to quit your job and blindly pursue your dream to start your own line of couture hamster fashions. You may be at the right place, but simply need to reconnect.</p><p> <strong>  SO HOW DO YOU START LOVING YOUR JOB? YOU CREATE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS: </strong></p><p> 1. As much as it may suck, taking responsibility is the first step to changing your situation. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s all your fault. It means that you&rsquo;re willing to do something about it. If you&rsquo;re committed to not leaving (or not yet at least),  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/how-to-lose-your-job-in-7-easy-steps\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   check this out  </u>  . </a></p><p> 2. Chances are, the last time you felt fulfilled, you were engaged and challenged. Quit waiting for something interesting to happen. Make it happen yourself. When you move things from the &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list to the &ldquo;did do&rdquo; list, you empower yourself. What can you do to be more proactive? Can you ask for an interesting assignment instead of obeying your inbox?</p><p> 3. Get a good reason. Sure, motivation can wax and wane, but your ability to push through the discomfort of the &ldquo;fuck its&rdquo; is only as strong as your reasons to do it.  Decide what you actually want to get out of this job (beyond the paycheck): </p><li> Do you want to learn more about your field?</li><li> Do you want to learn how to manage a team?</li><li> Do you want to learn how to resist the office candy jar? <br/>  </li><p> Whatever your goals are, find compelling reasons why they matter to you. If your reasons don&rsquo;t move you, nothing will.</p><p> 4. Incorporate what you love into what you do. What are the things you&rsquo;d be happy to do and never get paid for? What are the things that excite you? If you enjoy being the go-to person for advice, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to quit your job and become a therapist, it means you should include that talent in your day-to-day. And remember, your talent might not be what you do, but how you do it. A good friend of mine has the ability to break things down into logical pieces and build it back up again in a new way. His strange way of looking at things makes him successful in his career. If you can identify your talent and then use it to help others, you&rsquo;ll find fulfillment faster than it just took autocorrect to fix my misspelling of &ldquo;fulfillment.&rdquo;</p><p> 5. If you&rsquo;re committed to shifting your perspective, staying motivated, and honing your talents, then it&rsquo;s time to put it to work. What can you do to shift your environment to work for you? If you get assigned another crappy task, why not state your case for why you&rsquo;d like to be more challenged? Maybe that task is a better fit for someone else who would actually enjoy doing it. Start to find ways you can align with your job and have your job align with you.</p><p> Ultimately, if you decide to love your job, you&rsquo;ll love it. If you decide to hate it, you&rsquo;ll hate it. It comes down to choice. Which will you choose?</p>",

The more exciting news, arguably, is that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/rosetta-scientists-very-confident-philae-4647889\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rosetta scientists are \"very confident\" Philae will wake up again  </a> </u>  as the comet gets closer to the sun. It should be noted that in October, Rosetta had already detected formaldehyde (an organic compound), sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide (which is nasty-smelling stuff, and quite chemically reactive), plus carbon monoxide and carbon dioixide, in the comet's vicinity. <br/> <br/> How excited should we be about finding organic molecules on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko? It's hard to know, actually, until the identities and abundances of the organic molecules are determined in greater detail, but we should bear in mind that the finding of organic molecules in space rocks is nothing new. That's not to say it's not exciting, though. It always is, IMHO. <br/> <br/> Hydrocarbons are actually surprisingly abundant in space. The majority of stars in the Milky Way (and possibly elsewhere) are red and brown stars, including many brown dwarfs that are so cool (think room temperature) you wonder why they qualify as stars. Many of the brown dwarfs, in turn, are super-rich in methane (the simplest of hydrocarbons). <br/> <br/> Carbon chemistry is amazingly complex in meteors. (For a great overview, I recommend the  <u>  <a href=\"http://web.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/sephton.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2002 paper by Mark A. Sephton  </a> </u> .) Only about 5% of meteorites are iron meteorites (and that percentage is probably greatly inflated by discovery error). Most of the rest are carbonaceous chondrites. <br/> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_meteorite\" target=\"_blank\">   Murchison meteorite  </a> </u>  is among the best-studied meteorites and shows monocarboxylic acids at 332 parts per million; amino acids at a concentration of about 60 ppm; sugar-related compounds at 60 ppm; urea at 25 ppm; alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones at 11 to 16 ppm each; purines at 1.2 ppm; pyrimidines (uracil and thymine) at 0.06 ppm; and a zoo of other minority constituents. The fact that many of the amino acids discovered in meteorites do not occur in proteins has been taken as evidence of an abiotic source chemistry. Also, the fact that the meteors' chiral amino acids tend to occur in racemic mixtures (with no enantiomeric excess of L- over D-forms) has been taken as evidence of abiotic chemistry, although this view should be tempered by the finding that on earth, D-enantiomers in natural sediments tend to increase in concentration with the age of the sediment. (In other words, as sediments age, natural racemization tends to even out the ratios of D- and L- amino acids.) Also, it should be noted that enantiomeric excess has, in fact, been observed for some meteorite amino acids. The presence of enantiomeric excesses of various kinds in various amino acids from various meteorites, and the possible reasons for those excesses, are still a matter of contentious debate. (See Sephton's paper for details.) <br/> <br/> What's perhaps just as interesting (or more interesting) than the finding of amino acids in meteorites is the fact that much of the organic matter in carbonaceous chondrites is tied up in high-molecular-weight insolubles. Thus, the controversy over amino acids and their stereochemistry is somewhat like trying to understand the architecture of a house by analyzing the mortar holding together the bricks.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Organics.png\" width=\"406\"/></p><p> We know relatively little about the higher-molecular-weight components of carbonaceous meteorites. Sephton notes, however: \"The majority of the carbon in meteoritic macromolecular materials is present within aromatic ring systems.\" Indeed, many species of aromatics have been recovered from meteorites using thermal degradation (pyroloysis).  <br/> <br/> Where do all these compounds come from? We know that interstellar clouds contain methane, formaldehyde, water, molecular nitrogen, and ammonia. These molecules are known to condense around dust grains (and comets), but there's also a lot of UV light, ionizing radiation, and heat in environments like the early solar system; and these could have led to a lot of chemistry. Studying comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko should tell us more about all this, which in turn could help us understand how life arose on earth. We know that every day, something like a million kilograms of extraterrestrial material rains down on earth. The fall-rate was probably much higher, early in earth's history. It's not inconceivable that 10% or more of the biomass on earth got its carbon from \"somewhere else.\" (See the final paragraph of  <u>  <a href=\"http://web.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/sephton.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sephton's paper  </a> </u> .) Arrival of complex hydrocarbons from meteors, asteroids, and comets may well have jumpstarted life on earth. This isn't the only reason to study comets, but for me, it's one of the most compelling.</p><p>  </p>",

It is really important to have the correct employees so that the company can run smoothly. As business grows, new employees are needed. It is not as easy to find additional staff as you may believe at first glance and you have to be sure that you hire the right people.</p><p> As a job seeker, it will be important to read the following advice in order to recognize clues while on interviews.</p><p> There are many  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alleywatch.com/2014/12/why-do-startups-really-fail-the-real-problems-to-remember/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reasons why startups fail  </a> </u>  and you surely do not want to have problems because you need new employees and you do not know it. The most obvious signs that you have to hire new employees are the following:</p><li> <strong>  Employees Working Too Hard </strong></li><p> When  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/signs-youre-working-too-hard-2014-6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employees work too hard  </a> </u> , you will notice complaints and productivity will go down. The task of the business manager is to determine whether or not the complaints are legitimate. It is important that you talk with the employees and that you make sure that they are not overworked. See productivity and attendance indicators in order to substantiate the claims. If feedback is confirmed, restructure and reorganize responsibilities and roles so that you can deal with workflows.</p><li> <strong>  More Time Needed For Current Tasks </strong></li><p> If employees want to spend more time on the current tasks since they do not get finished on time, you need more employees.</p><li> <strong>  Services And Products Growth Curve </strong></li><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.monetarylibrary.com/important-tips-first-time-business-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   First time business managers  </a> </u>  need to identify positive trends in services or products growth curve. As this is noticed, extra staff is needed.</p><li> <strong>   Expansion And Growth Opportunity </strong></li><p> If you are sure that it is time to expand or grow, calculated risks can help you to expand. However, it is quite possible that the current employees cannot handle new responsibilities. Make sure that you never expand without extra staff if that is a necessity.</p><li> <strong>  Increased Knowledge Or Skill Sets Needed </strong></li><p> In most cases the existing knowledge and job skills are enough for the productivity level of a business. When expansion comes, this may not be the case as there would be a need for more. If you determine that this is the case, you have to hire new people.</p><li> <strong>  Increased Revenue </strong></li><p> If you are making good money and you believe that the trend will continue, you may want to get new employees so that you can expand.</p><p> If you are faced with the situations mentioned above, you will want to expand and hire new people. How you do this can have a huge effect on your company so you always want to hire those staff members that are appropriate. Make sure that the job description you write is accurate and that you highlight the following:</p><li> Duties, tasks and responsibilities</li><li> Reporting relationships</li><li> Job performance expected standards</li><li> Acceptable behavior standards</li><li> Fiscal and financial responsibilities</li><li> Working conditions</li><p> Hiring new employees is not as easy as you may be tempted to believe at first glance.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.monetarylibrary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Monetary Library  </a> </u>  showcases the fact that most companies do not actually have a proper hiring process set up. Make sure that you only consider the right candidates and that you invest in the actual hiring process. This is basically the only way to be 100% sure that you would make a good decision and you have to hire professionals in the event that you need help with the hiring process. Do not shy away from specialists since they can help you to find the suitable employees. &ndash; Boris Dzhingarov</p>",

    "content": "<p> A big part of generating your own success is knowing where to focus your effort and energy.  What's the best and highest use of your time?  A friend of mine Kevin Johnson, CEO of  Ontrack International shared with me five simple steps to find, and then prioritize, your best and highest use of time.</p><p> <strong>  The first step is to start by identifying your goals or priorities. </strong>  Let's look at this through the lens of improving your performance at work, although these steps can be applied to any area of your life.  If it's work related then it would makes sense to validate your goals or priorities with your boss.  Ask your boss what he or she wants you to achieve in the next 90 days.  This is a critical step because there may be some things your boss has in mind that are not yet on your radar.  My partner John Brantley, who has helped me develop the Performance Coaching programs we deliver at Cannon Financial Institute, refers to this first step in our coaching process as Clarifying Expectations.  Make certain that both you and your boss are on the same page as to what the expectations are.</p><p> <strong>  The second step is then to take an inventory of all of the activities in which you could engage. </strong>  Consider how you have spent the last 30 or 60 days.  What exactly are you doing with your time?  Don't get too granular with how you inventory these activities.  A smaller list will be easier to work with than a list of 60 or 70 discrete activities.  Organize these activities into a matrix and compare them to the goals you have identified.  This is will help you find your \"high impact\" activities.  To do this create a table.  List the goals across the top of the table.  These will become \"column headers.\"  Then list the activities down the right hand side of the page.  Now for each \"cell\" where the activity (row) intersects with a goal, rank the impact of that activity against the goal or priority.  Is it high, medium or low in its impact?  Do this for each activity.</p><p> <strong>  The third step is to study the completed activity impact matrix </strong> and identify those activities that are likely to have the most impact on your goals.  You are looking for those activities that have impact across multiple goals or priorities.</p><p> <strong>  The fourth step is analyze how much of your time </strong> you actually spend on these high impact activities that you have identified.  If you are like most people you will be surprised to learn that you are probably spending 20% or less of your time on the activities  that count the most.</p><p> <strong>  The fifth step is take charge. </strong>  Time management is really about choice management.  Spend one hour each week planning.  Make the right right choice about where and how you spend your time and you will be certain to realize significant performance improvement.  </p>",

    "link": "5-retirement-planning-game-changers",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  The way we go about the process of retirement income planning has changed in the last decade. </strong></p><p> The following five developments have forever affected the way we plan both before and during retirement.</p><p> <strong>  1. The Roth IRA </strong></p><p> The Roth IRA came into existence with the Tax Payer Relief Act of 1997. Although 1997 may seem like a long time ago, it takes many years for a new saving's tool to become mainstream. The Roth is well on its way and newer tax laws have made this tool even more accessible.</p><p> For example, starting in 2006 employers were allowed to amend their 401(k) and 403(b) plans to allow for designated Roth contributions. In 2010 the income limitation on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-let-them-talk-you-out-of-a-roth-conversion-2013-06-28\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Roth conversions  </a> </u>  was removed, and starting in 2013 in-plan Roth conversions were allowed.</p><p> Why is the Roth IRA such a big deal? The contributions go in after-tax, the money grows tax free and is withdrawn tax free in retirement (assuming you follow the rules), distributions don't count in the formula that determines how much of your Social Security will be taxed, and you aren't required to take a prescribed amount out when you reach age 70 &frac12;.</p><p> In addition you can take your original contributions (but not necessarily conversions or investment earnings) back out at any time with no taxes or penalties (Note: slightly different rules apply to designated Roth contributions within an employer plan.)</p><p> The flexibility this savings vehicle offers is unparalleled. It continues to change the way people plan, save, and spend in retirement.</p><p> <strong>  2. Sophisticated Social Security calculators </strong></p><p> Starting about 2010 online  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/socialsecuritybenefits/tp/Best-Social-Security-Calculators.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Security calculators  </a> </u>  began to sprout up. They&rsquo;ve continued to evolve into sophisticated planning tools that show you the effects of just about anything you want to see in relation to your benefits and claiming options.</p><p> Married couples can see how survivor and spousal benefits work. You can play around with the results over longer or shorter lifespans, see how working longer affects your benefits, estimate your future benefits at various ages, and instantly see claiming strategies that may be more or less appropriate for you. These online tools are a welcome retirement game-changer. They can help millions of Americans make better choices about their benefits.</p><p> <strong>  3. Academic research </strong></p><p> As waves of baby boomers reach retirement age, the demand for rigorous analysis has increased. Financial institutions and academics have started delivering detailed research that challenges many of the traditional approaches to generating income in retirement.</p><p> A few examples:</p><li> Traditional asset allocation advice is turned on its head in the paper  <u>  <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2324930\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Rising Equity Glide Path  </a> </u>  by fellow  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/retirement/mentors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RetireMentors  </u>  , </a>  Wade Pfau and Michael Kitces.</li><li> The idea that retirees need inflation adjusted income for life is challenged in  <u>  <a href=\"http://corporate.morningstar.com/ib/documents/MethodologyDocuments/ResearchPapers/Blanchett_True-Cost-of-Retirement.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The True Cost of Retirement  </a> </u>  by another RetireMentor, David Blanchett.</li><li> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://corporate.morningstar.com/ib/documents/MethodologyDocuments/IBBAssociates/AddingIncomeDimension.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Adding the Income Dimension  </a> </u>  Peng Chen and James X Xiong show that the traditional efficient frontier model used to build portfolios may not be the best approach to use as a saver's goal shifts from accumulating assets to generating life-long income.</li><p> This type of academic work is revolutionizing the way people plan for income in retirement.</p><p> <strong>  4. Specialized retirement income planning designations </strong></p><p> The Certified Financial PlannerTM designation has been around for over 25 years and has emerged as a needed minimum standard in the financial planning profession, much like an MD in the medical profession. However, just as with medicine, in financial planning, there are times where specialists are needed.</p><p> Two new specialty designations have emerged in the past few years, the  <u>  Retirement Management Analyst </u>  designation (RMA), sponsored by the Retirement Income Industry Association and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theamericancollege.edu/financial-planning/ricp-retirement-income-planning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Retirement Income Certified Professional  </a> </u>  designation (RICP) sponsored by the American College.</p><p> The curriculum in these designations focuses on the decumulation phase (vs. accumulation) covering distribution strategies, products, risks, and tax considerations that affect those who are withdrawing from savings and investments on a regular basis.</p><p> Retirement is a series of irrevocable decisions that need careful consideration. I anticipate more retirees will turn to specialists to help them navigate their way through the retirement income planning process.</p><p> <strong>  5. The Great Recession </strong></p><p> In the 90s many retirement planning projections were run using rates of return of 10% a year or more. Financial projections at such returns often showed that only minimal savings would be needed to achieve a reasonable retirement lifestyle. The Great Recession changed those assumptions.</p><p> After experiencing a prolonged period with below average returns more people are realizing you cannot count on above average returns to achieve your financial goals. You must create a plan that  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/assetallocation/fl/Why-Retirement-Investing-Needs-to-Be-Done-Differently.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   secures a basic retirement lifestyle  </a> </u>  regardless of the economic and market conditions you may encounter.</p><p> By approaching planning this way if you get above average returns you'll find that you can retire a bit earlier, or have a more comfortable lifestyle. This is much better than using overly optimistic assumptions and finding yourself barely scraping by because things outside of your control (market returns) didn't deliver what you had expected.</p><p> All in all, these retirement game-changers are helping us plan for a more secure future. I look forward to seeing the industry continue to evolve.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Ask any advisor and they&rsquo;ll tell you that almost all of their new business comes from a referral from an existing client, family member or a professional such as a local CPA or Attorney.</p><p> Financial advising, after all, is a relationship business.</p><p> But what do you do as an advisor when there is now more competition than ever, from more places and venues, including the new emerging &ldquo;robo advisors&rdquo; that have taken the online client experience to a new level?</p><p> Throw in the fact that what were once friendly referral sources - the aforementioned CPAs and attorneys - are now also rapidly embracing wealth management models of their own, and many advisors are wondering about the future of their new business pipelines.</p><p> The good news is that with technology innovation and new communication channels, advisors can turn themselves into powerful online marketers, nurturing their own referrals to continue to drive their own organic growth. </p><p> One such entrepreneur that is making this change happen for advisors is Justin Wisz, CEO of Vestorly. </p><p> Vestorly is a digital content marketing platform advisors can use to automatically curate and share content, articles, videos and more through their own websites and online newsletters, as well as the big three social networks, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn &ndash; all designed to keep clients engaged and generate new leads.</p><p> Add in mobile-ready display and powerful algorithms that provide business intelligence to advisors as to how their network is sharing and interacting with that content, and you have a recipe for a breakthrough in advisor marketing.</p><p> &ldquo;The average person consumes 83 pages of online content per day, sharing that content with roughly 4-6 people in their own personal network,&rdquo; says Wisz.  &ldquo;This is the new opportunity for advisors to influence how that content is nurtured and shared so that they can extend their brand reach and generate lead flow.&rdquo;</p><p> While online is now the new battlefield for investor mindshare, Wisz perfected his marketing approach working for one of the greatest marketers in the industry, Ken Fisher.  At Fisher Investments Wisz learned first hand the power of generating leads from prospects requesting content.</p><p> From there, Wisz leveraged that knowledge to consult with some large RIAs on how they can use content marketing to build their businesses.  This experience led Wisz and his co-founder Ralph Pahlmeyer to develop Vestorly as an automated platform, leveraging new technology and the explosive growth of social media, to be the efficient marketing engine for advisors.</p><p> The appeal of Vestorly is easy to see.  Advisors by their nature, are time-starved and do not have the resources or expertise to publish content and then actually follow through to support an ongoing marketing campaign.  Vestorly, with its intuitive and easy to use interface, automates the process, scouring the entire web to find, customize and publish relevant content for advisors&rsquo; target audiences.  Dashboards and email updates provide real-time information and updates, enabling advisors to quickly follow up on opportunities to develop new relationships.</p><p> In addition to RIA practices, Vestorly is being embraced by large enterprises, such as United Capital, RCS Capital and other broker-dealers and custodians.  As an example, United Capital&rsquo;s newsletters experienced a dramatic increase in open rates through the Vestorly platform.</p><p> Going forward, Wisz is investing aggressively in new capabilities, such as creating a &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; that vastly increases advisors&rsquo; reach.  Vestorly&rsquo;s early success is getting attention from the VC community and recently won a yearlong residency at the mid-town New York City incubator, Grand Central Tech.</p><p> Marketing and business development have never been a key skill set for the independent advisor community.  Doing a great job for clients, putting their interests first and a slow and steady approach to investing have served them well in the first couple of decades of the industry. </p><p> But, as they say, &lsquo;the times th ey are a changing.&rsquo; </p><p> Now more than ever in today&rsquo;s much more crowded and competitive marketplace, advisors need to find new ways to communicate their value add and get their message out to clients and prospects to ensure they have a sustainable business. </p><p> Fortunately there are innovative entrepreneurs with solutions at hand:  Case in point, Justin Wisz of Vestorly.</p>",

    "title": "Do Financial Planners Suffer from Marketing Myopia?",
    "link": "do-financial-planners-suffer-from-marketing-myopia",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://contarmedia.com/author/allan-ward/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Allan Ward  </a> </u>  | <u>  <a href=\"http://contarmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Contar Media  </a> </u></p><p> A while ago I read an article by Theodore Levitt called  <u>  <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2004/07/marketing-myopia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketing Myopia  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s a classic marketing article which appeared in the Harvard Business Review and is often used in business school courses. It was written over 50 years but is still as relevant today as it was the day it was written. In the article, Levitt talks about how hugely successful businesses failed because they didn&rsquo;t understand what markets they were in.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a quote from it:</p><p> \"The railroads did not stop growing because the need for passenger and freight transportation declined. That grew. The railroads are in trouble today not because that need was filled by others (cars, trucks, airplanes, and even telephones) but because it was not filled by the railroads themselves. They let others take customers away from them because they assumed themselves to be in the railroad business rather than in the transportation business. The reason they defined their industry incorrectly was that they were railroad oriented instead of transportation oriented; they were product oriented instead of customer oriented.\"</p><p> You can view a portion of the article on the  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2004/07/marketing-myopia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review site  </a> </u> . This link will only show part of the article to non-subscribers. (Hint: you can find the full article by doing a Google search for it.)</p><p> We see examples of Marketing Myopia today. The music industry is undergoing a massive shake-up as consumers change how they consume music. In the past you&rsquo;d have to buy a physical copy of the music &ndash; an album or CD &ndash; but now it&rsquo;s digital. You can buy single songs from iTunes or stream music via sites like Spotify. Many people now use You Tube as their music player of choice. When more people stream your music, your royalties are lower, but are recurrent in nature.</p><p> So musicians are confronted with this change and the smart ones are learning to adapt. They realise that the CD isn&rsquo;t the product &ndash; the song is. And the song can now be packaged in many different ways &ndash; an mp3 to download or stream, a video, a live performance etc.</p><p> Another great example of myopic thinking in business was Kodak. For many years Kodak believed they were in the business of printing photos. That belief almost killed their business. Consumers changed. With the popularity of digital photography the number of people printing out photos decreased. Again, we were able to consume the photos in different ways &ndash; rather than look at them in a photo album we were able to look at them on a computer screen. Now, with the cost of data getting lower and lower, we share these photos on sites like Flikr and Instagram.</p><p> I feel that the financial planning industry in Australia (and the rest of the world) also suffers from Marketing Myopia.</p><p> Over the past few years our industry has undergone a lot of change as the government here in Australia implemented the Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms. An outcome of these reforms is that many financial planners worked hard to define their value proposition &ndash; what they do for the client. Coupled with this was the need to change how we charge clients &ndash; moving away from a commission-based structure to a fee model.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve observed a lot over this transition period and I conclude that many planners are incredibly myopic in how they view their businesses.</p><p> Now, I realise I may put some people offside with this message &ndash; it may not be what you like to hear. But I believe it. I didn&rsquo;t like it either when I first started thinking about it, but I&rsquo;ve now come to a point where I accept that this is how our industry is.</p><p> <strong>  Are We Giving The Customer What They Want? </strong></p><p> \"The view that an industry is a customer-satisfying process, not a goods-producing process, is vital for all businesspeople to understand. An industry begins with the customer and his or her needs, not with a patent, a raw material, or a selling skill.\"</p><p> &ndash; Marketing Myopia</p><p> I used to have a uni lecturer who&rsquo;d say to the class &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you think, I only care what your target market thinks.&rdquo; We were taking a marketing subject, and he was pushing the point that we all have preconceived ideas about what a business should do, but the important opinions are those of your customers. What do they want?</p><p> If we asked our clients (and potential clients) what it is that they want when it comes to finances, what would they say?</p><li> Do they want a retirement fund?</li><li> An investment fund?</li><li> An insurance policy?</li><p> I don&rsquo;t think they would. I think they have financial problems like not saving enough for retirement.</p><p> The answer isn&rsquo;t a retirement fund &ndash; it&rsquo;s more than that. It&rsquo;s a total plan that starts with understanding their goals and objectives both now and in the future, putting some dollar figures around their goals, working out how much they need to be saving now to have the money available to achieve those goals, and then monitoring their progress along the way and keeping them accountable to those goals.</p><p> They want answers to problems &ndash; advice. And sometimes those answers will include products.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/MichaelKitces\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Kitces  </a> </u>  wrote a great article along these lines in March 2012 called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kitces.com/blog/is-it-time-to-redefine-the-value-of-financial-planning-to-expand-its-reach/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Is It Time to Redefine The Value Of Financial Planning To Expand Its Reach?  </a> </u>  Have a read and be challenged by what he writes.</p>",

    "link": "burning-the-candle-at-both-ends-am-i-a-workaholic",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;You are a workaholic!&rdquo;  </strong> was the last thing wanted to hear when I was going through burnout at the age of 27. First of all, being referred to as such would have implied that I was not in control of an area of my life, that I had an addiction. Not me! I was always in control of everything. Or so I thought.</p><p> I began thinking to myself, &ldquo;what is a workaholic?&rdquo; and began to do some research. According to Wayne Oates, who coined the term, it connotes an addiction to work. Typically, workaholics are people for whom work has become a single, all-involving preoccupation. It is the only thing in life that seems to matter to them, the only thing that makes them feel alive. They invest all their time and energy in it, so there is little or nothing left for other people or activities. That sounded too much like me!</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;The workaholic enjoys nothing except an occasional good meal, constant supplies of work, and a good bed to fall into from sheer exhaustion. This goes on until death&rdquo; </strong>  ~ Wayne Oates,  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Workaholic-Wayne-E-Oates/dp/B0006CKFY8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420493609&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Confessions+of+a+Workaholic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Confessions of a Workaholic  </u> </a></p><p> Just as devoutly religious people get their sense of &ldquo;significance&rdquo; from their religion, workaholics get it from their work. Since they do not need much besides work to meet their needs, most limit themselves to relationships that do not interfere with their work. Some workaholics choose to remain single for that very reason. Some find a workaholic spouse that won&rsquo;t interfere with their schedule. Others simply marry workaholics with the idea that somehow they change the person they are marrying into the person they want to live with.</p><p> In the most common situation, one spouse is a workaholic and the other is quite the opposite. Speaking from experience, I can tell you that this situation makes for a very stressful marriage. As a reformed workaholic, I can assure you that the more we experience stress in our homes as a result of our workaholism, the more we seek opportunity to escape. We go to work early, we stay late and we bring work home.</p><p> When both mates are workaholics, their involvement with each other is, of course, very limited. In this case, the children are neglected and suffer. Many people can identify with growing up with a workaholic parent, but as a child I knew what it was like to have two parents who were both very hard workers. They absolutely loved their work. For the first twelve years of my life, I did not know what a family vacation was, nor had I ever seen my parents even take as much as a day off to get away and spend time exclusively with each other &ndash; in order to rest from their work and invest in their relationship.</p><p> The most traumatic experience for workaholics is burnout caused by the very thing they love &ndash; work. Since relationships have not been a high priority, to whom does the workaholic turn to for support? In my experience as a workaholic going through burnout, I looked around me for support and found myself pretty much alone.</p><h3> The Addiction</h3><p> <br/> The idea of a drug addict or alcoholic we can understand, but we seldom give much thought to the workaholic. Possibly one of the most destructive of all addictions is the compulsion to work. Add to that the fact that it often goes untreated because it is the only addiction that makes you look like a hero. Workaholism has destroyed families, marriages and health, leading people down the path we call burnout, some till they reach the precipice known as suicide.</p><p> The balanced person can work with joy and deep satisfaction, but for the workaholic, the job or business becomes his god and the place of employment is the temple where he worships.</p><h3> The Symptoms of Workaholism</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Workaholics work long hours. </strong>   It is not uncommon for a workaholic to maintain a 14 hour/ day pace for six days a week. They also love to talk about how early they got to work, how late they stayed and how little sleep they got the night before. Before my burnout, a seventy-five hour work week was normal for me. I have since discovered that there is little relation between productivity and the hours worked and that I now accomplish more in fifty-five hours than I once did in seventy-five.</p><p> <strong>  2. Workaholics find it very difficult to say &ldquo;NO&rdquo; to people </strong> making demands on their time, often taking on more and more to please others and to be accepted. They also have trouble delegating responsibility since they feel they are the only ones who can do it right. They have trouble accepting the fact that they do have limits.</p><p> <strong>  3. Workaholics talk about work. </strong> People talk about the subjects that interest them; for the workaholic, that&rsquo;s work.  They seldom talk about or enjoy a hobby and rarely mention their family in conversation.</p><p> <strong>  4. Workaholics feel guilty when they relax. </strong> The family vacation is a waste of time for a workaholic, and an afternoon of golf causes more guilt than it&rsquo;s worth. An evening out with their spouse is easily pre-empted by something of higher priority at the office.</p><p> <strong>  5. Workaholics&rsquo; habits are destructive to their health. </strong> Physical ailments such as heart disease and circulatory problems are common among workaholics. Our bodies were not created to be used as machines.</p><h3> So, how do you develop a high performance attitude without becoming a workaholic? </h3><p> <br/> The key is balance. Have a passion for your family, friends, and hobbies as well as your work. Build your relationships with the same zeal you build your business or career. With balance, you get more done at work, and you have more fun with your family and your friends than you ever thought possible. You&rsquo;ll discover that the only difference between work and play is your attitude</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://www.appraisalresources.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Abigail Athanasopoulos  </u> </a></p><p> I recently had the pleasure of reading a fun and informative book by Thomas Hoving, former Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, titled  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/False-Impressions-Hunt-Big-Time-Fakes/dp/0684831481/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420494699&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Hunt+for+Big+Time+Art+Fakes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   False Impressions:  </u> </a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/False-Impressions-Hunt-Big-Time-Fakes/dp/0684831481/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420494699&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Hunt+for+Big+Time+Art+Fakes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Hunt for Big Time Art Fakes  </u> </a>  (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996). In the very first chapter of this book, the author presents his readers with a checklist that he created for his curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to use when considering potential acquisitions. This list essentially acknowledges the fact that the market for art and antiquities is rife with fakes and forgeries (Hoving states that during his decade and a half at the museum, he would conservatively estimate that 40% of the 50,000 works or so that he examined could be characterized as &ldquo;phonies&rdquo; or forgeries) and that it is extremely important, especially when large sums of money as well as the reputation of a museum are at stake, to be aware of potential red flags. Hoving&rsquo;s checklist consists of 15 steps in its entirety, but he claims that the following 11 are absolutely crucial:</p><li> Note and write down your initial impressions of the object/artwork (Hoving attests to the idea that first impressions are almost always spot-on, especially when something just doesn&rsquo;t appear &ldquo;right.&rdquo;)</li><li> Make a meticulously detailed description of what you see (a step that underscores the importance of examining every inch of the object).</li><li> Describe its condition.</li><li> Ask yourself what the object was used for (most artworks were, until recently, utilitarian).</li><li> Note whether condition is consistent with intended use.</li><li> Describe its style.</li><li> Note whether style is consistent with supposed date.</li><li> Assemble documentary information (realizing that this paperwork can also be faked).</li><li> Assemble published references, exhibition history, provenance, etc.; is the provenance complete and can it be supported?</li><li> Have a complete scientific examination done of object/artwork (including as wide a range of methods as possible, such as carbon 14, thermoluminescence, ultraviolet, x-ray, etc.) and then &ldquo;discount everything you find.&rdquo;</li><li> Consider any rumors in the marketplace about the object&rsquo;s authenticity/true identity.</li><p> The author concludes that if all this data supports the first impressions, it is probably safe to move ahead with acquisition; if not, additional research should be completed pertaining to each and every doubt that has cropped up. <br/> <br/> Although originally intended as a checklist for museum curators, this list addresses many of the complexities surrounding fakes and forgeries and could prove useful to anyone working with fine art objects. As an appraiser, it is imperative to be aware of these issues during field inspections. Although we do not authenticate (a topic to be addressed in more detail in a future blog entry), it is important that we are able to notice any red flags that might indicate that an object or artwork is something other than what it is purported to be (and then act accordingly, usually by referring the client to the proper source for authentication); obviously there are limits to what appraiser can do (for example, we will not be conducting carbon 14 tests on site), but this is no excuse for a lack of due diligence. Collectors also need to be aware of these issues, particularly when considering potential purchases. Trust your instinct; ask the important questions; and, if an object/transaction seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>",

    "content": "<p> At <a href=\"http://www.liveoakbank.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Live Oak Bank  </u> </a> , we have the opportunity to observe the development of many acquisitions and mergers. There are things that make a great deal: a &ldquo;meeting of the minds&rdquo; between buyer and seller, complementary strengths among the staffs, compatible office cultures, a growing stream of new clients who will benefit from the increased reach and expertise unleashed by combining the firms.</p><p> As we all know, however, there are at least &ldquo;50 ways to leave your lover,&rdquo; and at least as many ways to spike what, at first, looked like a deal made in heaven. Here are the problems we see most often. Future posts will cover how to fix them&mdash;or avoid them altogether.</p><li> <p>  <strong>   Valuation/Purchase price:  </strong>  Sellers tend to think their business is valued higher than the market will bear (go figure). The problem we see often is the misconception that any financial advisor&rsquo;s business can be valued at approximately 2x revenue. The business should really be valued based on a multiple of cash flow and a discounted cash-flow analysis. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Seller Transition:  </strong>  Sometimes it is tough for a seller to let go, and he or she would like to stay on as an employee for a longer period of time than the buyer anticipates. Other times, the buyer would like the seller to stay on to help with the transition, and he or she is looking to retire completely before a transition can be completed. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Culture vs. courtship:  </strong>  Buyers and sellers typically undergo a courtship period, and many times, after multiple meetings, one party realizes that they are not a good fit. This may be because the two parties run their businesses differently, or because they have created much different cultures within their organizations. Do not underestimate the importance of culture. That is what will make it possible for two staffs to mesh&mdash;or not. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Sustainability of profits:  </strong>  After taking a deeper dive into the business, a potential buyer may find that profits are not as sustainable as the financials first indicate. Threats to sustainable profits include: high average age of the clients, recent growth derived from market gains rather than net new assets, client concentration, or a large portion of nonrecurring revenue. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Post-transaction changes to the business:  </strong>  Sellers like to protect their clients and their employees. If they get the sense that a buyer is going to make major changes that will affect their business, employees or clients, they may hesitate to complete the transaction. </p></li>",

To bring the piece to a conclusion, motivate the customer, and tell them what action to take &ndash; aka how to buy. But does it belong in your content marketing strategy? Absolutely! As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.chrisbrogan.com/contentmarketing201/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chris Brogan explains  </a> </u> :</p><p> &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not putting some kind of potential hook to future business into your efforts, you&rsquo;re not content marketing. You&rsquo;re writing.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Create a call to action 1st </strong></p><p> You hopefully know why you&rsquo;re creating a piece of content marketing, but do you know what you want your audience to do after they read your content? Start with that decision. When you know your destination before you start, it&rsquo;s much easier to get yourself, and your audience, there. In a  <u>  great post about defining your CTA </u> , Anne Murphy outlines the importance of defining your CTA early.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the key to converting visitors to customers, and the whole point of content marketing,&rdquo;</p><p> says Murphy.</p><p> <strong>  Make a choice </strong></p><p> As with any piece of marketing communication, you have to make smart choices when it comes to your CTA. While you can offer a primary and a secondary call to action, don&rsquo;t rely on throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks. &ldquo;ACT NOW, CLICK HERE, CALL TODAY!&rdquo; is a sure path to being ignored. Unless, that is, you&rsquo;re selling Snuggies. You&rsquo;re building your brands reputation with every piece of content, and a communication that says everything, really says nothing. It just comes out as noise.</p><p> <strong>  Make it visible </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t hide your CTA in the corner. Use some style, keep your reader in mind, and in today&rsquo;s any device world, be sure to keep user experience as a top priority.</p><li> If you&rsquo;re going to put it within your content, make sure your audience will notice it.</li><li> If you want your audience to sign up for your email list, put that form above the fold.</li><li> If you want them to click a button, give it some visual weight</li><p> You should also keep in mind that every rule has an exception. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to test your CTA&rsquo;s placement.</p><p> <strong>  Test and learn </strong></p><p> One of the great things about digital marketing is the ability to test and optimize. Move that subscription field from above to below the fold, test out different button copy, and find out if your designer was actually right about not using Comic Sans on buttons. Try different things and see what works for your audience. In her post,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2014/24277/five-tips-to-enhance-your-call-to-action\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Five Tips to Enhance Your Call to Action  </a> </u> , Stephanie Thompson, vice-president of client services for  <u>  <a href=\"http://perq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PERQ  </a> </u> , tells us:</p><p> &ldquo;At the very least, test the idea against similar campaigns you&rsquo;ve done in the past. Pick one variable to change and track how it impacts the results. If it works, great! If it doesn&rsquo;t work, adjust and try something else.&rdquo;</p><p> There&rsquo;s an art to crafting a call to action, but when you start with one in mind, choose your destination, make it visible, and learn from past campaigns, you&rsquo;ll find yourself crafting yours with ease.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When I began marketing financial services, social wasn&rsquo;t on the media landscape. In those days, not that long ago, we relied on traditional media, some digital (search &amp; email), public relations and promotions to attract the attention of the people we wanted to serve.</p><p> The marketers who succeeded in that environment did masterful jobs understanding where to find their prospective customers and crafting messages that moved them.</p><p> They weighed the merits of a growing list of media channels and allocated their budgets in ways they hoped would achieve a measurable return on investment. The addition of social media has made things more complicated. It has also made them better.</p><p> What&rsquo;s cool about social media is its ability to supercharge all the great marketing you are already doing. No matter how you go about marketing your company or brand, social media can amplify and extend the impact.</p><p> Whether you are already participating in social media or making plans to start, these five steps will help make your social strategy a success, with outcomes your CEO and CFO will like just as much as you do.</p><li> <strong>  Prepare an editorial calendar: </strong> Think about your social media strategy as a narrative arc that extends through the next 12-18 months, and tell a story you believe will matter to your clients. If you are active on multiple platforms, such as LinkedIn and Facebook, it&rsquo;s critical to remember that each demands its own style and content. Your social strategy should complement and reinforce your overall marketing strategy.</li><li> <strong>  Upgrade your content: </strong> Whether you are writing and publishing your own, curating the content from other sources, or a combination of both, make sure it is consistent with your brand, your strategy and meets your highest standards for quality and integrity. If you are empowering the field &ndash; your advisors, bankers, analysts and so forth &ndash; work with them to find or create content that is suited to their business and their audience.</li><li> <strong>  Be fanatical about analytics: </strong>  Watch your results (likes, shares, comments, click-throughs) closely and be prepared to make adjustments when things go well and&hellip; well&hellip; not so well.</li><li> <strong>  Invest in a social media compliance provider: </strong>  Most companies who are active in social media have already contracted with a company like  <u>  <a href=\"http://socialware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Socialware  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://hearsaysocial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hearsay Social  </a> </u>  to help surveil, moderate, approve and archive social media content. The SEC and FINRA pay close attention to member firms&rsquo; activity in digital media. The good news is that with these tools you can manage the risk!</li><li> <strong>  Most important of all, BE SOCIAL:  </strong> Too many firms in the financial services industry treat social media the same way they do more traditional media.  This is not a place to hawk product. Listen to what your audience is saying, explicitly or through their behavior, and respond. Social is where you build and fortify relationships and trust. Deliver content that people value. Deliver it repeatedly and consistently, and you will earn the opportunity to ask them for something.</li><p> This is an exciting time to be in the financial services industry. By embracing digital media overall, and social media specifically, financial services companies and professionals can be visible and relevant in ways other media simply can&rsquo;t match. Stick to these steps, and you&rsquo;ll be on the right track, nurturing existing relationships and creating opportunities for new ones. Now&hellip;go get &lsquo;em.</p><p> Does your broker, wealth manager or bank do a good job interacting with you on social media? What companies in any industry do an exceptional job? What kind of content would you be interested in seeing from them?</p>",

    "link": "top-12-regulatory-deficiencies-for-rias-5-brochure-delivery",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  What You Need to Know </strong></p><p> To our surprise, failure to follow the brochure (aka Form ADV Part 2) delivery rules continues to be one of the most common deficiencies for RIA firms. <br/> <br/> Annual distribution of Form ADV Part 2 (along with the privacy policy) is required by all RIA firms. Additionally, an updated version must be delivered to clients when any material changes occur within your business. <br/> <br/> A common (and logical) questions we get is &ldquo;What&rsquo;s material?&rdquo; The SEC doesn&rsquo;t define material, which makes sense since materiality is very much dependent on circumstances. A rule of thumb we use with clients is this: if a knowledgeable client or prospect would expect to be alerted of a change, it&rsquo;s material. Admittedly, this still leaves a lot open to interpretation (we&rsquo;ve seen it first hand). Regulators will cast the final vote on this during their next examination, so it usually pays to err on the side of caution. <br/> <br/> When material changes do occur, RIAs have the following options: <br/> <br/> Option 1: If there have been material changes to your business, they must be described in ADV Part 2, Item 2. Under the current rules, you could provide your clients with a summary of these material changes and an offer to deliver the entire ADV Part 2. In your offer you must include instructions on how clients can obtain a copy from you. <br/> <br/> Option 2: Advisors can also opt to deliver a full copy of the entire ADV Part 2. In this instance Item 2 - Material Changes still needs to be updated. <br/> <br/> All brochures must be delivered to clients within 120 days of fiscal year end. Electronic delivery will suffice if you are attaching the document to an email. Uploading your ADV to your website and sending a link to clients does not constitute proper delivery. You may lose the ability to show exactly what was delivered to the client.</p><p> <strong>  Why You Should Care </strong></p><p> Your brochure informs clients of the details of your firm and any recent material changes that could potentially impact them. You should view your brochure as a publicly-visible sign for your firm, and should be written and updated with this notion of \"curb appeal\" in mind. Potential and current clients see this brochure as a representation of your firm, and providing them with an up-to-date, accurate brochure signals that you take external communications seriously. <br/> <br/> Competitors are reading your firm's brochure as well. A sloppy, outdated, or inaccurate ADV sends a message to competitors that may be damaging when competing for new business. </p><p> <strong>  Our Recommendations </strong></p><p> To ensure that your firm is keeping up with regulatory requirements and industry best practices in this area:</p><li> Review your ADV to ensure that it reflects your business, including disclosures for conflicts of interest, outside business activities, advisory services, and advisory fee practices. These are all important issues for regulators. </li><li> Deliver brochure to clients within 120 days of your fiscal year end</li><li> Maintain records that demonstrate delivery of Form ADV Part 2 to clients (annually or upon material changes) and prospective clients (prior to executing advisory agreement).</li><li> Maintain copies of prior versions of your Form ADV Part 1 and 2</li>",

    "link": "fear-of-conversions-is-a-good-thing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Is this your firm? Unhappiness with the legacy software, interest in new technology, excitement during the evaluation, contract ready to sign&hellip;. </p><p> And then time passes without a decision.</p><p> Fear has set in and you can&rsquo;t let it go. It seems that someone you know has a bad conversion story and this prevents you from making the decision to convert your legacy system.</p><p> <strong>  So why is fear a good thing? </strong></p><p> You are aware of what can go wrong with the conversion. Your mind is filled with valid concerns.  </p><p> Don&rsquo;t avoid the issues by believing that while the current technology is not the best solution for your firm, it is good enough &ndash; you know what the problems are with the current system and have work-around solutions for the problems. Keeping your obsolete technology or home grown (manual/Excel) solution is not the answer. If it were, you wouldn&rsquo;t have started this process.</p><p> Listing your concerns and addressing each issue will help ease the fear. This will enable you to make a decision regarding the conversion. The following are some concerns that firms have with conversions and what you should do to alleviate the fear:</p><p> <strong>  Cost  </strong> &ndash; Advisors begin the process by proudly stating they are making an investment in their firm. Once they add the cost of the conversion to the new system, advisors quickly change their tune and this becomes an expense to the firm. </p><p> You should  understand that conversions are not cheap and they are an investment. A successful conversion is a one-time cost. Analyze the cost (read: investment) over the many years you will benefit from the system and you will realize that the cost is not high.</p><p> <strong>  Conversion &ldquo;horror&rdquo; stories </strong>  &ndash; You are hesitant to go through with it because of your last conversion experience or another firm&rsquo;s conversion story. </p><p> You should  document what went wrong and how the process can be improved. Areas to investigate include staff availability to work on conversion tasks, decisions left to vendors without understanding how those decisions affected your firm, assumption that no issues existed with the data being converted, and vendor contract/deliverables not specific enough. Any of these situations would result in an unsatisfactory conversion.  </p><p> You should not  base your fear on another firm&rsquo;s conversion story unless you have the facts and understand what went wrong.</p><p> <strong>  Losing or changing data </strong>  &ndash; This is a valid concern. You have information dating back to inception and wonder what will happen to that data. You fear that the information or data in the new system won&rsquo;t be the same and worry that &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; with your client data await you after the conversion. </p><p> You should  understand the conversion process from the vendor. To alleviate any surprises, understand the issues involved with converting historical client (CRM) and transaction/performance (portfolio reporting system) data and analyze available options. Review and understand the mapping process of the current data structure over to the new software, including the new methods of accessing data.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Lots of sellers of products are trolling for new clients, new prospects and older investors with substantial assets. </strong> They use a proven technique that could trap your client.  You can educate your clients early and often about the technique, which is the &ldquo;free meal educational seminar&rdquo;.  These seminars are not, by themselves, a bad thing. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve even put one on yourself, or considered doing so. But too many unethical people are using these to sell inappropriate investments to older people.  The annuity scams are notorious for this.</p><p> As people age, about a third of them will develop  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.agingparents.com/can-seniors-with-early-dementia-safely-handle-money/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease  </a> </u> . Most of the victims of this insidious disease are women.  When the earliest signs of the disease emerge, research tells us that impairment of  <u>  financial judgment </u>  is already underway.  How does that affect you?</p><p> FINRA has issued an alert for investors about &ldquo;free lunch&rdquo; investment seminars and you can use that as a reason to contact all of your older clients now and warn them.  Here&rsquo;s the gist of what FINRA wants seniors to know.</p><p> The FINRA Investor Education Foundation researched people over 40 to find out how many have been solicited with offers for a free meal seminar.  64 percent of respondents had been solicited, which means that the odds are, your clients will be among them. What the research also showed was that half of the sales materials contained claims that were apparently exaggerated, misleading or otherwise unwarranted. Would your elderly client, getting a modest return under your watchful guidance and adherence to his long time investment philosophy, be seduced by a slick invitation leading to a claim of high rates of return?  13 percent of these seminars appeared to involve fraud, such as unfounded projections of returns and sales of nonexistent products.</p><p> Slick and unscrupulous &ldquo;advisors&rdquo; and sellers have been at this for years, pitching unsuitable products. They&rsquo;ve stepped up their game as the population ages. <strong>  They want every target they can get. </strong></p><p> What you can do to stop anyone else from stealing away your client with promises of a free &ldquo;education&rdquo; seminar with its pitch and possibly false promises is to educate your client yourself.</p><p> <strong>  First, warn them about the prevalence of these hard sell efforts disguised as a benevolent presentation to the public. </strong> These seminars are designed to sell, no matter who puts them on or where they are done.</p><p> <strong>  Second, help your client understand the intention: </strong>  They want the attendees contact information, and sometimes they ask for confidential financial information. They may well be targeting seniors so that with their contact information, the sellers can hound the seniors until they buy, even if it is not at the seminar itself.</p><p> <strong>  Third, teach your clients about the smooth and rehearsed presentation techniques the sellers use to get people to buy. </strong>  They promise phantom riches, &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; to produce certain income.  They try to create credibility by associating themselves with a reputable sounding firm.  They tell the seminar attendees that savvy investors have already purchased this particular product they&rsquo;re pitching, and they often also use the &ldquo;scarcity&rdquo; technique that suggests there is a limited time to buy, a limited supply, or that this is a one-time only opportunity for a special, reduced price.</p><p> If you want to head off the efforts of those who are putting on seminars to get older clients in their grasp and possibly, away from you, be proactive.  We suggest that you create a brief informational packet to be given to all of your clients age 65 and up.  Give them the fine points of this article. Help them make responsible choices and stay in communication with you about any seminars they want to attend.  By doing so, you can improve your chances of retaining your aging clients and protecting them from unwise financial choices.</p>",

    "link": "heres-the-pricing-mistake-almost-every-financial-planner-makes-and-how-to-fix-it",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Imagine that your prospects didn&rsquo;t hesitate, not even for one second, to pay your price. That it would be &ndash; in fact &ndash; a no-brainer.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s possible? Then stop here.</h3><p> <br/> However, if you don&rsquo;t want to leave money on the table and if you don&rsquo;t want to miss my free gift at the end of this article, you might want to keep reading.</p><p> How do I know that most planners make this mistake?</p><p> Because they don&rsquo;t know the psychology that goes with the setting of profitable prices for their services.</p><p> And no, the mistake is not that you charge too little (though that is a common mistake as well).</p><p> And no, the mistake is also not that most planners sit back and think to themselves: &ldquo;Hmmm, what price should I pick?&rdquo; And then they pull a number out of a hat and that&rsquo;s it.</p><h3> The mistake is to have only one price for your service.</h3><p> <br/> Why? Because if you have only one price, you are not making it easy for your potential clients to decide to do business with you. You see, most of the time your prospects generally can&rsquo;t understand or accurately explain why they want to hire a financial planner. The truth is, when you help them to decide to do business with you, it saves them time, money, and energy.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why you want to set a smart price that will turn your offer into a no-brainer. Luckily, financial planners are by definition smart people. And, simply put, I believe smart planners want to set smart prices.</p><p> And before you wonder if I&rsquo;m going to discuss a commission-based model, a fee-only based model or any other type of revenue model in our industry, I&rsquo;d like to be straightforward with you on this one: I&rsquo;m not. Because I believe &ldquo;models&rdquo; aren&rsquo;tthat important. In fact, what I do believe is that if financial planners serve their clients in an ethical, honest and sincere way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which type of revenue model you choose.</p><p> And if you think your customers do care about your &ldquo;model&rdquo;, well, you&rsquo;d better read this.</p><h3> What You Can Learn from Bread Machines When It Comes to Pricing</h3><p> <br/> Years ago I read  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061353248/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0061353248&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;linkId=KXBPLKZFAEZM26UZ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions </a> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seebeyondnumb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0061353248\"/>  by Dan Ariely. For the planners who haven&rsquo;t read this bestseller; it&rsquo;s about human irrationality and how we can predict this irrationality when it comes to decision-making.</p><p> And for those who don&rsquo;t know; people are far less rational than standard economic theory assumes. Because sixty years of reseach has shown that 95% of our decisions are irrational.</p><p> That&rsquo;s quite unbelievable when you read those statistics for the first time. Because most of the time we &ndash; as logical, analytical and rational financial planners &ndash; tend to believe our decisions are, indeed, rational.</p><p> But&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..they&rsquo;re not. Just read this short irrational story about bread machines and I&rsquo;ll show you.</p><p> You might have heard this classic story about how Williams Sonoma introduced a bread machine into the market and why they thought it would sell extremely well.</p><p> However, long story short, it didn&rsquo;t. It didn&rsquo;t sell well at all.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why they decided to introduce a new bread machine. A bread machine that cost 50% more than the original bread machine. The first bread machine cost $275 and the new and second machine cost $429.</p><h3> Guess what happened?</h3><p> <br/> Sales of the first bread machine (the cheapest one) almost doubled. What happened was that people saw this as a &ldquo;trade off effect&rdquo;. They didn&rsquo;t want to buy the most expensive option, so they decided to buy the cheaper option.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because the most expensive option is seen as a price-anchor, making the first bread machine appear cheaper and look like &ldquo;a deal&rdquo;. People rationalize purchasing the less expensive option by avoiding the most expensive option.</p><p> There is only one problem with this strategy: it kills your revenues. What&rsquo;s worse is that people tend to haggle the cheapest version down further.</p><p> How to Fix Pricing Mistakes</p><p> As Dan Ariely points out in Predictably Irrational, it&rsquo;s all about relativity. People not only tend to compare things with one another but also tend to focus on comparing things that are easily comparable &ndash; and avoid comparing things that cannot be compared easily.</p><p> What do I mean?</p><p> Take a look at this ad from The Economist:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/economist.gif\" width=\"350\"/></p><p> The first option &ndash; the Internet subscription &ndash; for $59 seems reasonable.</p><p> The second option &ndash; the $125 print subscription &ndash; seems a bit expensive, but still reasonable.</p><p> But then, the third option: a print and Internet subscription for $125.</p><p> Huh?</p><h3> Is that a typo?</h3><p>  </p><p> If it&rsquo;s true, who on earth would buy the print option alone when both the Internet and print subscription are offered for the same price?</p><p> What&rsquo;s really happening is that the (very smart) Economist-marketers probably WANT people to skip the cheapest option.</p><p> As Ariely points out:</p><p> The marketing wizards know something important about human behavior: humans rarely choose things in absolute terms. People don&rsquo;t have an internal value meter that tells us how much things are worth. Rather, we focus on the relative advantage of one thing over another, and estimate value accordingly.</p><p> And in this case, you may not have known whether the Internet-only subscription at $59 was a better deal than the print-only option at $125. But you certainly knew that the print-and-internet option for $125 was better than the print-only option at $125.</p><p> In fact, you could reasonably deduce that in the combination package, the Internet subscription is free!</p><h3> How You Can Use This In Your Financial Planning Service</h3><p> <br/> If you are like me, you now might have an idea how you could use this in your own financial planning service.</p><p> You might think, hey, I&rsquo;m going to copy this. And this is how it might look:</p><p> Offer #1</p><p> Financial Planning: $2,497 plus monthly fee $97</p><p> Offer #2</p><p> Wealth Management: 1% of AUM</p><p> Offer #3</p><p> Wealth Management &amp; Financial Planning: 1% of AUM</p><p> The first offer seems ok. The second option seems a bit expensive, but still reasonable. But then your prospect reads the third option before his eyes run back to the previous options.</p><p> &ldquo;Who wants to buy stand alone financial planning, your prospect wonders, when wealth management PLUS financial planning is offered for the same price?&rdquo;</p><p> The third option is in fact, a no-brainer.</p><p> What&rsquo;s going on here? Most of your prospects don&rsquo;t know what they want unless they see it in context. They don&rsquo;t know what kind of racing bike they want &ndash; until they see a champ in the Tour de France ratcheting the gears on a particular model. They don&rsquo;t know what kind of speaker system they like &ndash; until they hear a set of speakers that sounds better than the previous one.</p><p> Your prospect doesn&rsquo;t know what price they want to pay &ndash; until they see the other options where they &ldquo;only&rdquo; have to pay 1% for wealth management PLUS financial planning. Because then it clearly looks superior.</p><p> And I hear you think: that&rsquo;s great Ronald, but &hellip;</p><p> What if I&rsquo;m an Hourly-Rate Planner or a Planner with a Monthly Retainer Model?</p><p> Then picture yourself grabbing a cab. Picture yourself looking at that taxi meter. Don&rsquo;t you hate watching the taxi meter going up, knowing that every extra inch of the way is costing you?</p><h3> Why do people hate this?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s because of the pain people are suffering. Not physical pain of course, but rather activation of the same brain areas associated with physical pain. The same goes for some of our revenue models.</p><p> You see, your clients are not weighing their current gratification vs. future gratifications. They experience an immediate pang of pain when they think of how much they have to pay.</p><p> So, suppose you are an hourly-rate financial planner, then try to honestly answer this question:  Do you believe serving your client by the hour minimizes pain? Or is it like the taxi meter?</p><p> It&rsquo;s obvious, right?</p><p> But hey, not to worry. Because you might want to consider why AOL switched from pay-per-hour Internet service to pay-per-month. And that &ndash; because of doing this &ndash; they got a flood of new subscribers.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s not strange. You see, science tells us that people love to prepay for things or pay a flat rate for things.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because it mutes the pang of pain.</p><p> Marketers have realized this for years, and they have responded with offers designed to minimize pain associated with buying their products. Netflix crushed its video rental competitors in part by its &ldquo;all-you-can-watch&rdquo; price strategy. Cruises have surged in popularity in part because they deliver a vacation experience for a fixed price.</p><p> In each case the marketer offers a single, relatively attractive price that removes additional pain from the buying experience.</p><p> In our industry, the single price (flat fee or all in fee) is actually higher than the amount your client spends on your advice. Nevertheless, the all-inclusive fee is likely to appeal to many of your clients.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because it mutes the pang of pain.</p><h3> So, why don&rsquo;t you try to avoid multiple individual pain points in your financial planning service?</h3><p> <br/> There are several options. You might want to experiment with a single-price approach for your services such as an annual fee or all in fee instead of the hourly-rate. That simpler pricing approach may boost not only sales. As some people will pay a premium for pain avoidance, profit margins may boost as well.</p><p> However, if you don&rsquo;t want to do the hard work yourself, but instead, want to use a proven price-strategy that &ndash; regardless of your revenue model &ndash; works to sell the type of financial planning service you want to sell, the only thing you have to do is to answer the following question:</p><p> What is your biggest problem when it comes to the price of your financial planning service?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Years of confinement to a nursing home is everyone&rsquo;s worst fear for old age.</p><p> With a semi-private room now costing about $81,000 annually, the prospect of a lengthy stay is also a popular reason for buying a long-term care insurance policy to cover it.</p><p> Undercutting this rationale is a  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/briefs/long-term-care-how-big-a-risk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new study  </a> </u>  led by senior economist Anthony Webb of the Center for Retirement Research, which sponsors this blog. He finds that U.S. nursing home stays are relatively short: 11 months for the typical man and 17 months for a woman.  There&rsquo;s some unpleasant news in the study, too, because the risk that an older person may one day need nursing home care is 44 percent for men and 58 percent for women.</p><p> The significance is that nursing home stays are higher-probability, lower-cost events than previously thought, which reduces the appeal of purchasing long-term care insurance.  This finding helps to explain why so few older Americans &ndash; 13 percent &ndash; buy the coverage to protect their financial assets from potentially being drained by nursing home bills.</p><p> The biggest reason for the lack of interest in insurance had already been well-documented in the research: Medicaid pays for a long-term stay in a nursing home for those who can&rsquo;t afford one.  The upshot for individuals weighing whether to buy the private insurance is that the benefits of doing so often accrue not to the individual who bought the policy but to the government, in the form of reduced Medicaid payments.</p><p> But the new study added an assumption absent from previous attempts to estimate how many people might benefit from having insurance: Medicare also sometimes pays for shorter nursing home stays, accounting for about 15 percent of total long-term care spending.</p><p> Taking all of this into account, just 31 percent of women and 19 percent of men benefit from buying long-term care insurance &ndash; far fewer people than previous studies had estimated.</p><p> The Center&rsquo;s new, lower estimates of Americans&rsquo; willingness to pay for the insurance combine the best methods used in a pioneering 1996 study and a 2014 study.  The Center used monthly &ndash; rather than annual &ndash; probabilities of transitioning between various levels of care, from healthy and requiring home health care to residence in an assisted living facility, a nursing home, and death. These probabilities were applied to an economic model estimating a single person&rsquo;s willingness to pay for long-term care insurance.  The Center also used fresh data on the actual lifetime patterns of care use revealed in a nationally representative survey of older Americans.</p><p> Everyone&rsquo;s circumstance is different, but this research strengthens the take-away from prior studies: buying long-term care insurance does not make financial sense for many people.</p>",

    "content": "<p> She sat across the table from me diligently working on a new script. I had heard her on a few previous calls with potential clients; her strategy was clear and her execution process was by the book. She pressed for the sale and ended each call asking for a commitment. But closing the sale was difficult and the entire process was so much work.</p><p> She would come in to the office early and stay late, and made more contacts than her peers (all male), but her numbers were not what they should be.  Knowing her as well as I did, it was hard to watch her struggle and, as a coach, it was really difficult for me not to speak up right away, but I knew when she was ready she would ask for my help. </p><p> As a natural achiever she was constantly searching for the perfect process, the right words that would generate more positive results perhaps that&rsquo;s why she finally reached out and asked &ldquo;What are some questions I can ask that will help me uncover the issues better?&rdquo;  We talked about her process and I shared a few questions that could better open up the dialogue. Then, I told her what I believed was her real challenge, and what I thought could unleash her success.</p><p> &ldquo;You have all the right lines, you follow the process of your firm, you are doing and saying everything right just as you were taught, but you are not sharing YOU in the call. You are not trusting yourself so you can really listen and feel what has to come next.&rdquo; She looked at me and simply said, &ldquo;I know&rdquo;.</p><p> The moment I said those words she could feel what I was saying. The entire process she was using was so uncomfortable for her and it all felt staged. She trusted her managers and was diligent in doing exactly what they were telling her but, as a result, she was losing her real power&mdash;herself. This was a strong, very confident young woman, a former athlete who understood the value of coaching and the importance of following instructions.</p><p> But in the financial services industry, the coaching and guidance is NOT necessarily conducive to women.</p><p> This was a prime example. While management could SEE what she was capable of, they did not know how to coach it out of her. Being the only female advisor in the company, this was not surprising.</p><p> These are challenging situations for women and often cause women to lose confidence in their skills and ability over time.  Women have struggled to adapt for way too long; they have natural abilities that are being denied and overlooked. The key is learning how to integrate the teachings and learning&rsquo;s from men into your own strengths as a woman. However, more often than not, instead of integrating we submerge ourselves in the male model.</p><p> <strong>  So what&rsquo;s a girl to do? </strong></p><p> For this young woman there were two options:</p><p> <strong>  &lsquo;Go for broke&rsquo;: </strong>  Trust that she had the skill sets and start focusing on being more natural and authentic during her phone conversations. She had developed some great skills now it was time to integrate her unique strengths as a woman and go for it!</p><p> OR</p><p> <strong>  Change jobs: </strong>  In most cases, I would suggest that you consider changing jobs ONLY after &lsquo;going for broke&rsquo;. You will never know what you could achieve until you truly unleash your strengths as a woman. But under some circumstances, you may recognize that your current position will not allow or support your desire to stray from the pack and follow what you know to be a better way of building a business.</p><p> Women have conformed, adapted and stuck it out for way too long. You have nothing to prove to anyone but yourself. When you deny yourself, when you hide your strengths, when you tune out that inner voice and become that warrior, you will never achieve your true potential as a woman in business.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://alexpirouz.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alex Pirouz  </a> </u></p><p> When is the last time that you reviewed the status of clients for your business?</p><p> More specifically, how many of you could answer the following questions about your clients:</p><li> How many clients does your business have?</li><li> How many of these clients are active?</li><li> What is the value of each of these clients to the business?</li><li> Which clients have dropped by the wayside?</li><p> If you can&rsquo;t answer these questions, then it may be time to consider the reporting systems with your business.</p><p> A common misconception is that &ldquo;big data&rdquo; is a resource only available to the world&rsquo;s largest companies; however, as technology advances and open-source platforms become more prominent, more small and medium-sized businesses are able to harness the power of these large data sets to help them boost their bottom lines.</p><p> It has long been agreed that data is an essential corporate asset, second only to people. In order for your business to maximise the investment in its assets, a structured program of management and maintenance is required.</p><p> The ability to analyze and act on data is increasingly important to businesses. The pace of change requires companies to be able to react quickly to changing demands from customers and environmental conditions. Although prompt action may be required, decisions are increasingly complex as companies compete in a global marketplace.</p><p> To gain a deeper insight and understanding on the importance of data in business, I recently spoke with Eric Holtzclaw, Author of the book: &lsquo;Laddering Works&rsquo;.</p><p> As Chief Strategist of Laddering Works, Eric partners with C-suite clients to advise them on the development of customer-centric products, services, marketing messages and experiences through the utilization of data.</p><p>  &ldquo;Companies are collecting more data than ever about their customers in an attempt to understand what&rsquo;s really important to them and in hopes of using that data to gain a competitive edge. </p><p> \"The problem with this approach is you shouldn&rsquo;t collect data for data's sake.  By spending time with and truly understanding the motivations of the buyers of your products or services you can determine what&rsquo;s important to track and what data is an accurate representation of success,&rdquo; Eric explains.</p><p> The importance of data quality can never be underestimated. Incomplete and inaccurate data will adversely impact all elements of your business. In today&rsquo;s e- enabled market place growth and diversity is dependent on data quality.</p><p> But having data is merely the first step, you then need to convert those raw facts and statistics into accurate, timely and organized information for a specific purpose to help increase your understanding and decrease uncertainty.</p><p> &ldquo;Knowing where your going is the first step in getting there&rdquo;</p><p> Small businesses are major drivers of innovation and account for approximately half the world&rsquo;s gross domestic product. In addition, they find unique ways to solve complex business problems. SMBs have the opportunity to think outside the box when utilizing big data and analytics solutions to create truly fresh approaches.</p><p> When properly implemented, analytics can be a game changer for small firms, but it&rsquo;s important that the correct steps are taken to ensure that any solution is tailored to suit their customer&rsquo;s unique needs.</p><p> Here are a few pointers from Eric to help you get started:</p><p> <strong>  1  &ndash;  Patterns Are Only a Starting Point: </strong>   Too many companies that I work with start and end with a pattern that they see in their data: a page that is converting well, a drop in overall sales, or an increase in customer complaints.  They jump to conclusions about what the patterns mean before they have enough information.  Before you do that, step back and make sure you really know why.</p><p> <strong>  2 &ndash; Strive to Understand Why: </strong>   The only way to truly understand a pattern is to ask your customers.  These conversations should be in person and one on one, which let&rsquo;s you ask follow-up questions and make sure you are not making incorrect assumptions.</p><p> <strong>  3 &ndash; Start Broadly: </strong>  In order to do this successfully, you need to start your conversations broadly.  Get to know your customer and what they do and care about outside of your business. This approach lets you understand how your products or services fit into the rest of your customer&rsquo;s life.</p><p> <strong>  4 &ndash; Stop When You See Patterns: </strong>  Done correctly, you will see patterns in the conversations after about 18 interviews.   This first-hand customer knowledge becomes the lens you need to unlock the patterns in your data.</p><p> <strong>  5 &ndash; Create Meaningful Move Forward Metrics: </strong>  An important aspect of creating a successful product or service is to make sure your metrics mean something. Use the new knowledge you have of your customers to decide on meaningful metrics and create useful reports that will drive your business to success.</p><p> Data, big or small, is essential for every business.</p>",

In the private client world much emphasis is put on delivering on a brand promise &ndash; of functional effectiveness in setting and delivering on the right expectations, of effective disclosure and, in regulated firms, adherence to a culture that has conduct risk at its heart.</p><p> All this is important. But as Justin Basini comments in his excellent book <u>  <a href=\"http://www.basini.com/the-book/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Why Should Anyone Buy from You?  </a> </u>   &ndash;  trust is &ldquo;a two-way relationship&rdquo; and if businesses &ldquo;want people to trust them, they need to trust back&rdquo;.</p><p> Being unafraid to ask for client feedback and comment in a way that is open and honest (without breaking client confidentially protocols) impacts the way clients feel about a firm and can only help to increase word of mouth.</p><p> Asking for insight and feedback gives clients not only the encouragement to refer you but also the story platform to do so.</p><p> Why? Because it is much easier for clients to refer their adviser not just as someone who competently looks after their needs but also as someone who regularly asks them for feedback and acts on it.</p><p> Asking clients for feedback and acting on it demonstrates their importance to your business in a tangible way &ndash; making them feel like valued insiders.</p><p> Without that level of two-way engagement it is hard to encourage referral out of the blue &ndash; even in the warm glow of a particular piece of work successfully completed prompting referrals is hard to do effectively.</p><p> Embedding feedback into the client journey can draw clients and introducers, and also internal audiences, together more strongly. Regular feedback touch points with your clients can help keep a firm top of mind and tip of tongue.</p><p> Feedback programmes also provide an opportunity to tell /remind clients of everything you do or could do for them - increasing their perception of the value of what you do for them and potentially open up further/additional conversations leading to uncovering additional needs and/or assets.</p><p>  </p>",

What exactly does ESG mean and how are companies integrating this practice?</p><p> The acronym itself stands for <strong>  Environmental, Social and Governance </strong> . Companies use ESG as a risk assessment strategy incorporated into both their investment decision-making and risk management processes. These factors are often clear indicators of a responsible, well-governed company. Examples of ESG are:</p><p> <strong>  Environmental </strong></p><p> Company Activity:</p><li> Manage resources and prevent pollution</li><li> Reduce emissions and climate impact</li><li> Execute environmental reporting/disclosure. <br/>  </li><p> Positive Outcomes:</p><li> Avoid or minimize environmental liabilities</li><li> Lower costs and increase profitability through energy and other efficiencies</li><li> Reduce regulatory, litigation and reputational risk <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Social </strong></p><p> Company Activity:</p><li> Promote health and safety</li><li> Encourage labor-management relations</li><li> Protect human rights</li><li> Focus on product integrity <br/>  </li><p> Positive Outcomes:</p><li> Increase productivity and morale</li><li> Reduce turnover and absenteeism</li><li> Improve brand loyalty <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Corporate Governance </strong></p><p> Company Activity:</p><li> Increase diversity and accountability of the Board</li><li> Protect shareholders their rights</li><li> Report and disclose information <br/>  </li><p> Positive Outcomes:</p><li> Align interests of shareowners and management</li><li> Avoid unpleasant financial surprises or &ldquo;blow-ups&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p>  ESG standards are becoming a larger part of the alternative investment world, including the impact investment space.  ESG issues are not only central to measuring the sustainability and non-financial impacts of an investment, but can have a material impact on the long-term risk and return profile of investment portfolios. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.oekom-research.com/homepage/english/oekom_DPG_Performance_Study_2012_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Oekom Sustainability Financial Performance Research Study  </a> </u> , investors receive a &ldquo;double dividend&rdquo; in the form of a better rate of return with lower risk. The study found that companies that incorporate ESG standards prove to be more conscientious, less risky and therefore more likely to succeed in the long run. Socially responsible investors use ESG screens as a tool to confirm that investments are in compliance with local laws, as well as committed to sustainable and ethical business practices.</p><p> Alternative investments are not the only investments being screened with ESG factors. Traditional investors, who invest in alternative platforms, are using the ESG framework for assessing risk in the investment decision-making process. Firms like Blackrock and Vanguard have not only incorporated ESG into their compliance and legal risk-mitigation strategies, but also into their investment strategies. The board of Wellington Management, an investment management firm based in Boston, explained their motivation for using ESG, &ldquo; ESG integration is simple: to increase financial returns while upholding the fiduciary duty to incorporate any known risks into the investment process.&rdquo; </p><p> ESG standards provide another level of due diligence, which is in the best interest of shareholders. When the UN launched UNPRI in 2006 and watchdogs like Bloomberg and MSCI started tracking ESG, it became abundantly clear that this was not a short lived fad.  ESG weeds out unsustainable companies with outdated practices and harmful side effects, while also minimizing risk for investors as they invest in more responsible companies with a greater likelihood of succeeding in the long run.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hootsuite.com/author/ryanholmes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ryan Holmes  </a> </u>  | <u>  <a href=\"http://hootsuite.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HootSuite  </a> </u> It&rsquo;s a fact. Email is making us slower, less productive and even dumber.The average employee now checks email  <u>  36 times an hour </u> , spending  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a full 13 hours a week  </a> </u>  reading, deleting, sending and sorting emails. Each time we&rsquo;re distracted with an email, it takes  <u>  <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/chi_2007_iqbal_horvitz.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   an average of 16 minutes  </a> </u>  (yes, 16 minutes) to refocus on the task at hand. But the news gets worse: Workers who check email frequently  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/22/text.iq/\" target=\"_blank\">   suffer a 10-point drop in IQ  </a> </u> , the equivalent of missing an entire night&rsquo;s sleep.Our email inboxes, once-upon-a-time the private repository of important messages, have become an open door for anything and everything. Much of this is little more than glorified spam; precious little is actually time-sensitive, actionable or even worth opening. Adherents to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/12/zero-dark-inbox.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;inbox-zero&rdquo; philosophy  </a> </u>  insist that it&rsquo;s best to systematically filter through the madness, attend to each message in some form or another and clean out your inbox every day. Really? I think there&rsquo;s a better way.As the CEO of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   global social media company  </a> </u>  with more than 600 employees, I get hundreds of emails a day (sometimes thousands). Some matter; most don&rsquo;t. The key to getting off the email hamster wheel is quickly assessing which messages deserve attention and then responding as efficiently as possible. And lots of times this means abandoning email altogether in favour of low-tech tools like telephones and high-tech channels like social media.Here are six techniques I use to manage my constantly overflowing email inbox: <img alt=\"\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/email1.jpg\" width=\"400\"/> <strong>  1. Slim down the number of messages you look at with a tool like SaneBox </strong> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sanebox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SaneBox  </a> </u>  uses a unique algorithm to sort through all of your incoming emails. Messages that are considered non-priority are automatically put into a designated @SaneLater folder (that you can check at your convenience). Sanebox works with major email providers, like Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo, and is  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sanebox.com/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cheap  </a> </u>  and easy to use. It has saved me a lot of time and ensures that my top priority emails aren&rsquo;t drowned out by less important ones. <img alt=\"\" height=\"247\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/email2.jpg\" width=\"498\"/> <strong>  2. Write emails using the three sentences philosophy </strong> For years now, I&rsquo;ve added a custom signature to all my emails: &ldquo;Sorry about the short response. I wish I could be more thorough, but with the volume of emails I receive that isn&rsquo;t possible.&rdquo; I include a link to a site that explains the philosophy in more detail:  <u>  <a href=\"http://three.sentenc.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://three.sentenc.es/  </a> </u> . This approach &ndash; effectively treating all of my emails like short SMS text messages &ndash; has worked extremely well for me. I&rsquo;ve trained myself to leave out the fluff and keep only the most essential points in an email. If I absolutely have to say more, I just pick up a phone or talk in person. <img alt=\"\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/email3.jpg\" width=\"400\"/> <strong>  3. Use the Rapportive app to quickly get context about the people you email </strong> If you like free timesavers, you&rsquo;ll love  <u>  <a href=\"https://rapportive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rapportive  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s an extension for Gmail that automatically shows you the LinkedIn photo, profile and shared connections of pretty much anyone you email. Just start composing a message, type in an email address and the relevant information pops up in the right sidebar. When you need to quickly respond to a lot of emails &ndash; many from people you haven&rsquo;t met or barely know &ndash; it can be very helpful to have all of this background instantly available. <img alt=\"\" height=\"80\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/email4.jpg\" width=\"400\"/> <strong>  4. Used Canned Responses for messages you send frequently </strong> Do you find yourself typing out essentially the same email replies over and over?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Canned-Responses-in-Gmail\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Canned Responses  </a> </u> , one of the experimental &ldquo;Lab&rdquo; feature in Gmail, is a perfect solution. It lets you compile a library of messages you send frequently, which can be accessed when composing an email with just two clicks. Gmail automatically plugs the message into the top of your reply. All you need to do is hit send. <img alt=\"\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/email5.jpg\" width=\"381\"/> <strong>  5. Opt out of annoying group email threads with the Mute feature </strong> It&rsquo;s amazing how few people know about the  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/47787?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   Mute button for Gmail  </a> </u> . It makes those long, annoying email threads involving too many co-workers disappear like magic. Next time a group email starts bombarding your inbox, just select the conversation and click Mute in the &lsquo;More actions&rsquo; drop-down menu. Any new responses added to that conversation will automatically bypass your inbox and be archived for later reading (or ignoring). <img alt=\"\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/email6.jpg\" width=\"400\"/> <strong>  6. Use social media for group conversations </strong> On the subject of annoying threads, the reality is that email was never intended for collaborative work. Try setting up a meeting time with a group on email and that becomes obvious. Messages flood in, leaving users scrolling madly to keep in sync with the conversation. A better option: Internal social networking tools like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.yammer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yammer  </a> </u>  that feature Facebook-style discussion threads. This way, multiple employees can post, reply, and view centrally, in real time. It&rsquo;s an incredible time-saver, with the added benefit that these central threads can be made publicly searchable for future use.A  <u>  <a href=\"http://thehiredguns.com/end-of-email/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   growing chorus  </a> </u>  is calling for the death of email, but for now at least it&rsquo;s a workplace institution we&rsquo;re stuck with. The key is to make it work for you, instead of the other way around. The tactics above should help limit time spent reading and responding to messages. And if all else fails, there are of course more radical measures. Unplugging from email &ndash; even for just half-hour stretches &ndash; can do wonders for productivity &hellip; and your sanity.</p>",

    "link": "6-things-that-can-hurt-your-brand",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Are you aware of how you may be hurting your brand? You may feel you&rsquo;re doing business as usual but your customers may differ. Here is a list of 6 things that can hurt your brand.</p><p> <strong>  1. Having A Bad Social Reputation </strong></p><p> Balancing your brick-in-mortar brand with your online brand may be challenging but critical to when developing a solid social reputation. Consumers&rsquo; may favor a brand based upon the level of engagement with its followers.</p><p> Since consumers do business with brands they like and trust, establishing a great social reputation is key.</p><p> Social media communication builds trust and if your brand has a poor social reputation, consumers will distrust your content and potentially your offerings.</p><p> <strong>  2. Not Listening To Your Audience </strong></p><p> Great brands tend to be speedy and agile. Understanding their customers wants, needs, and challenges gives them ability to react and update marketing communications campaigns in real-time.</p><p> When brands don&rsquo;t listen to what consumers are saying online, they are missing opportunities to reinforce brand messages as well as garner potential sales.</p><p> Consumers are accustomed to having brands respond after mentioning them on social media. When brands don&rsquo;t respond, they&rsquo;re sending a message of being too busy to respond or just not concerned with what customers are saying. All of which may hurt a brand.</p><p> <strong>  3. Having A Poor Website Design </strong></p><p> In his book titled  <u>  Blink </u> , Malcom Gladwell discusses how packaging design affects customer perception. He cites how packaging impacts customer impressions so much that the perceived quality and taste of the products can be affected.</p><p> So, if you are building a website or considering a redesign, be sure that your new site conveys quality with an organized, uncluttered layout, with good use of images.</p><p> A poor website design has:</p><li> Complex, busy layout</li><li> Lack of navigation aids</li><li> Small print</li><li> Too much text</li><p> First impressions are important and the look and feel of a website greatly influences a consumer&rsquo;s perception of a brand.</p><p> <strong>  4. Having An Inconsistent Brand Image </strong></p><p> Your brand is the public face of your business.  Your brand image should be consistent as it differentiates you from your competitors in a tight market place.</p><p> Conversely, a weak or inconsistent brand can be disastrous as it may confuse your potential customers. A confused customer is not likely to be a return customer, and growing your business is not something you want left to chance.</p><p> Also, inconsistent branding can undermine customer confidence in your business&mdash;especially those familiar with your brand.</p><p> For instance, say the logo displayed on your website is different than the one displayed on your social media. Your consumers may wonder how well you can satisfy their expectations if you can&rsquo;t manage your own brand.</p><p> <strong>  5. Developing Low Quality Content </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it, today&rsquo;s mobile devices are capable of creating great content and consumers naturally expect that brands are capable of creating high quality content. Consumers may associate your brand with the quality of the content developed.</p><p> If your brand produces lower quality content, it increases the likelihood of being hidden behind several pages of search engine results.</p><p> Google, for example, becomes more determined to drop brands with lower content. Naturally, so will your customers. In the end, this may hurt your brand financially.</p><p> By developing high quality content, your brand becomes an attractive resource for consumers.</p><p> For video based content, low quality content has:</p><li> Poor sound quality</li><li> Bad lighting</li><li> Poor technical production (i.e. buffering, resolution, etc.)</li><p> For text based content, low quality content is:</p><li> Duplicate content: such as changing words to form new blog posts or reusing the same content more than once.</li><li> Keyword stuffed content (this is an outdated technique but I have found some sites that still use it).</li><li> Irrelevant to your reader.</li><p> <strong>  6. Lack of Planning </strong></p><p> It may be tempting to let your business grow organically and retroactively respond to the changes in consumer tastes and market trends, but this lack of planning can hurt your brand. Developing concrete plans will guide your brand in a positive direction.</p><p> Ultimately, there are several risks that can hurt your brand if you don&rsquo;t have plans in place to monitor and stop problems before they arise.</p><p> For instance, do you have a natural disaster or PR blunder plan in place? Without this plan you&rsquo;re at a greater risk of doing more harm than good.</p><p> Prescheduling your marketing communications is not a bad thing. Failure to develop an action plan to update or stop your prescheduled campaigns after a national tragedy is the ultimate &ldquo;no no&rdquo;.</p><p> For example, following the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, the NRA made this entirely inappropriate tweet just a few hours after the tragedy happened:</p><p> &ldquo;Good morning, shooters! Happy Friday! Any weekend plans?&rdquo;   -@NRA_Rifleman</p><p> I think the lesson learned here is if you are going to schedule your tweets in advance, make sure they are still appropriate and relevant before they go live.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Developing your firm&rsquo;s position on responding to a crisis: Message</p><p> Since this series started out with a song title, thought we&rsquo;d continue with the music theme. When you&rsquo;re in the midst of a crisis situation, you may well feel like sending out an SOS (maybe a few of them!).</p><p> In the last post, <u>  <a href=\"/marketing/just-another-tricky-day\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Just Another Tricky Day  </a>  , </u> I wrote about the timing principle. We&rsquo;re shifting gears to the message, perhaps the most critical piece of the crisis communications puzzle.</p><p> You might be wondering how you can possibly be prepared from a message standpoint without actually being in the middle of the crisis. While you may not have all the facts and figures at the moment, you can establish a few guardrails. Here are some questions to think about:</p><p> <strong>  How transparent are you going to be? </strong> This one is a biggie. And your compliance and legal departments will likely have some opinions. In general, the most trusted businesses and brands do have a high degree of transparency&mdash;in good times and bad. The more you can share the better (as long as it is factually accurate of course). Clients appreciate knowing what is going on, and when a problem is going to be resolved.</p><p> <strong>  Will you offer an apology? </strong> This is sometimes a matter of corporate culture. One way to approach the decision is to look at the nature of the crisis (or error). If the situation is a result of a third-party (or an industry-wide issue) it may not be necessary to apologize. But in the case where the problem is clearly at your firm level, then you may want to apologize up front. In both cases, empathizing with the client is critical.</p><p> <strong>  What kind of language will you use? </strong> This is not the time to be heavy-handed with industry jargon and terminology. Plain English with easy to understand terms will not only put your client more at ease, but it may also take the pressure off your frontlines from clients not having to call in for an explanation. Any next steps the client needs to take should be clear and easy to act on. Try to anticipate client questions, and perhaps publish a FAQs document along with your initial message.</p><p> <strong>  What scenarios can you plan for now? </strong> While no crisis is exactly the same, there are some common situations that may come up. A data incident of some kind seems to be the new normal these days. Whether an issue happens at your own firm, or with a third-party, you&rsquo;ll want to give some thought to how you&rsquo;d respond. Will you offer clients some form of additional protection, such as complimentary credit monitoring? Or what if one of your locations is struck by a natural disaster?

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://www.rpgplan.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RPG &ndash; Life Transition Specialists  </u> </a></p><p> The month of January has come to be known as &lsquo;divorce month.&rsquo; The start of the New Year brings with it a roughly one-third increase in divorce filings, perhaps because families opt to stay united throughout the holiday season.</p><p> There are few life transitions more difficult than navigating a divorce. According to Nicole Mayer, AIF, CDFA of RPG Life Transition Specialists, a holistic wealth management firm in Chicago, both parties must arm themselves with knowledge and understanding to avoid unnecessary complications, especially as they relate to their finances.</p><p> &ldquo;The number of people who jump into a divorce without realizing the kind of financial implications it has is diseartening,&rdquo; says Mayer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like having a baby without ever reading a parenting book. Our goal is to make sure folks know what to expect, and are prepared for the unexpected.&rdquo;</p><p> Below are RPG Life Transition Specialists&rsquo; top five tips for navigating divorce month as unscathed as possible.</p><li> <strong>  Anticipate Up Front Costs: </strong> A divorce typically costs no less than $20,000, and understanding that up front will make for a smoother transition. &ldquo;When you factor in lawyers, tax advisors, time off work, the cost of a divorce is greater than it may appear at the outset,&rdquo; warns Mayer. &ldquo;Do your research so there are fewer surprises. Also, consider mediation as part of your divorce, which significantly reduce the costs.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Understand Your Immediate Needs. </strong> Over the short term, your number one goal should be survival. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re concerned about making ends meet during and after the divorce, that should inform your negotiation strategy,&rdquo; says Mayer. &ldquo;Stocks and bonds, which can be easily liquidated, should be a priority above retirement accounts or other long-term investments.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Review Past Tax Returns. </strong> Sit down with your spouse and review the past five years of jointly-filed tax returns to determine income and future tax advantages. &ldquo;Oftentimes, there are tax benefits accrued during a marriage that come to fruition years in the future,&rdquo; says Kadish. &ldquo;Those are negotiable assets to consider.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Consider Beneficiary Information. </strong> Take some time to review and adjust the beneficiaries on your retirement accounts and insurance policies. &ldquo;Amidst all the paperwork and meetings, this is often overlooked,&rdquo; says Mayer. &ldquo;If you have to name a minor child as a beneficiary, you&rsquo;ll have to determine a guardian who is not your soon-to-be-ex.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Check Your Debt. </strong> Any debt realized jointly during the course of a marriage stays with a married couple indefinitely. &ldquo;Regardless of what settlement terms you secure, if one spouse does not pay a debt you both incurred as agreed, the other is responsible,&rdquo; cautions Mayer.</li><p> Divorce is understandably difficult, but knowing what to expect and having a clear plan for managing finances will help make it as smooth of a life transition as possible.</p>",

    "content": "<p> 2014 proved to be an unexpectedly volatile year for bond investors. As the year began, we saw research reports from every major Wall Street broker-dealer calling for higher interest rates and, in some cases, a bursting of the so-called &ldquo;bond bubble&rdquo; that (according to some) has been forming over the past 30+ years. What transpired was something quite different. Longer-term rates fell sharply while short-term rates were mostly unchanged. This dramatic flattening of the yield curve came despite a steadily improving domestic economy, the strongest employment numbers in 15 years and a Federal Reserve that began to publically discuss tightening monetary policy.</p><p> So why did interest rates fall despite an abundance of good news that historically causes them to rise?  In financial markets, the events and trends that few predict tend to have the largest impact. In 2014, those events emerged in the form of European and Japanese Central Banks failing, despite their best efforts, to avoid the imminent danger of recession and deflation. Weakness in these developed market economies, coupled with geopolitical tensions around the world, caused a classic &ldquo;flight to safety&rdquo; trade as global investors sought the safety of U.S. dollar denominated assets. This is clearly illustrated by the performance of the U.S. Dollar during 2014 &ndash; see chart below. These developments led to positive performance for our client portfolios, with our Short, Intermediate and Long Duration strategies generating after-fee returns at or above inflation.</p><p> <strong>  DXY Index </strong> <strong>  (source: Bloomberg) </strong></p><p> <strong>  <img alt=\"\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fx.png\" width=\"800\"/> </strong></p><p> Looking ahead to 2015, we expect another good year for bond investors. As an investment team, we regularly come together to assign probabilities to different market outcomes. The results from our 2015 outlook meeting point to an interest rate environment where longer-term rates are unlikely to stray outside of the range that came to define the second half of 2014. This view is driven by an expectation of continued economic weakness overseas, low inflation here at home and a Federal Reserve that will struggle to move from the zero-bound despite wanting nothing more than to do just that. If this outlook proves correct, positive returns for 2015 should follow. In addition, we are beginning to see value once again in some of our favorite trades. After having underperformed Treasurys during 2014, corporate bonds are again offering attractive risk-adjusted value. We also like taking credit risk in certain sectors of the municipal market as fundamentals for most (stress most, not all) municipalities are on strong footing. Of course, there is a chance that an unforeseen event will rear its head once again. If opportunities arise as a result of market surprises, all of our portfolios have high quality liquid securities that can be used to fund opportunistic trading. At this stage, we are comfortable that our portfolios are well positioned for the New Year. </p>",

What is important to them? What keyword do they use to answer their questions?</li><li> ​Who are you? What are your brand and added value? What makes you better than your competitor?</li><li> What is the purpose of writing new content for your website? What do you want your audience to know and to do towards your firm?</li><p> The simplest questions are always the hardest to reply to, but they will help you direct your effort to your objectives.</p><p> <strong>  From the big idea to small pieces </strong></p><p> Considering the important amount of time and energy requested to write proper content, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up!</p><li> Start with the &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; or the main message you want to communicate to your audience.  Just like an advertising catchphrase, it is the very core soul of your firm and what makes you unforgettable among all your competitors.</li><li> ​Break it down in smaller pieces. With your big idea in mind, cut it into manageable size for each and every page of your website.</li><li> ​Describe each page purpose. Despite the obvious function of the page (contact, price and so forth), keep in mind you can give countless information about your firm in all circumstances. Loyalty, ethics, performance, social responsibility&hellip;these concepts are not meant to be stuck into the &ldquo;About us&rdquo; page but can be displayed even on the contact form!</li><p> Your website is an amazing platform where creativity is king, make sure you take advantage of it!</p><p> <strong>  Focus on Quality, not Quantity </strong></p><p> Bad sales people talk all the time. Good sales people listen and know the value of words.   </p><p> No, it is not another quote from a sales guru, but just a feedback from my own experience. Nothing is more annoying than talking for nothing, especially in business. Spare your visitors the pain of getting lost into your website and make sure you go straight to the point! It is not an easy exercise since most of us a drawn into endless justification of our own qualifications. But keep in mind your visitor is here for a reason: he wants to know, indeed, whether you fit for the job&hellip;so help him know you are!</p>",

    "content": "<p> It is very common to hear from career experts that you should define your values first before you could set your career path. This may sound easy, but you actually cannot define your values without knowing what they are actually. </p><p> Well, your values are comprised of the things you think and believe are essential in the way you work and live your life. Your values are what should help you identify your priorities both at work and in life. It is also your values that you can use to determine whether the things that are going on in your life are part of your plans or intentions.</p><p> You can say that life is good when your decisions, behavior, and lifestyle actually match your values. This is when you can feel contentment and satisfaction. On the other hand, you will always have a feeling that something is wrong when such things do not align with your personal values. As a result, you will suffer from discontentment and unhappiness. With all that said, it is important that you make a conscious effort to identify your values and live your life according to them.</p><p> <strong>  How Do Your Values Affect You? </strong></p><p> Whether you are aware of them or not, values do exist. But what can make life much better and easier is your awareness of such values. Ideally, all the plans and decisions that you make should be in accordance to your values.</p><p> Imagine that you have to work 70 hours a week and you are someone who values your family, do you think you will suffer any internal conflict and stress? If you are someone who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy being competitive and you are put in a situation where everyone is competitive, do you think you will find satisfaction in your workplace?</p><p> In such situations, the conflict between your values and the things you are actually doing can definitely affect the quality of your life. But when you get a clear understanding of your own values, it will be much easier for you to decide if you are in the right place or not. By being aware of your own values, you will not find it difficult to decide what job you should pursue, whether to accept or decline a promotion, or even whether you should keep or leave your job. Needless to say, these issues can have a huge and negative effect on how we perform at work. Thus, we should find a way to really understand what it is that we want in life so we could be in a better position to pursue our personal and career goals.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong></p><p> You will realize that your values are generally consistent and stable. But of course, there no boundaries or limits to them. This means that as you go on with your life, you may feel that your values are changing and are possibly getting bigger. This is because your standards of a good life also change as you gain experience and meet different kinds of people. With that said, it is vital that you always revisit your values to make sure that you will not lose sight of what matters in your life and what  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/career-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   career moves you should and should not make  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;There are two critical things a leader does; provide a future vision and inspires and develops others join in the quest!&rdquo;</p><p> For over 30 years, I have been wrestling with the questions of &ldquo;what is leadership?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what do leaders do&rdquo;.  I have gone back and forth on the answers during my journey.  The definition of leadership will be addressed in future conversations.  However, what leaders do, has greatly influenced the #leadershipflow methodology. As with the concept of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.croftandcompany.com/origins-leadershipflow-methodology-self-mastery-1-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Self-Mastery  </a> </u> , the idea of Visioning the Future came through hundreds of conversations that I had with leaders as a coach.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2.-Visioning.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> In many conversations with leaders I coach, I asked them what they wanted to create.  The answer was typically one of two things.  The first, and often most clear, was they did not want to create.  They did not want poor performance, conflict, missing deadlines, all of the typical frustrations leaders face.  They had difficulty articulating what the opposite of what they had.  Our conversations would explore the gap of performance of current state and the future state.  The future state was usually metric driven &ndash; meeting production goals, creating highly functioning teams, etc.  The vision of how they wanted their teams to perform, how they wanted to treat one another, how leaders would show up and communicate.</p><p> The second thing leaders wanted when they created a vision for the future was very unclear utopia.  They would state that they wanted decisiveness, accountability, teamwork and all of the great business success buzz words.  When I probed as to what accountability looks like, their answers would vary but were missing the behaviors they would like to see.  How would a leader like to show up?  How would a leader have a conversation with her team?</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.croftandcompany.com/visioning-future/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Visioning the Future  </a> </u>  occurs when a leader becomes clear on how he or she would like to conduct effective conversations.  In what moods would these conversations happen?  Would they be in the constricting moods of resignation, resentment, frustration and anger?  Or would they be in the powerful moods of acceptance, ambition, wonder, playfulness and collaboration?  Visioning the future is not about sales goals, production numbers or efficiency.  All of those metrics are already present in organizations. Visioning the Future is about how we want people to show up. It is about how you inspire the inherent strengths and cares of each person on your team so that they show up fully committed and available to your organization.  Visioning the Future is about the powerful conversations that you will unleash.</p>",

How long will it take before we realize that we are trying to force a square peg in a round hole?</p><p> A client recently told me that he had an awful day simply because he was caught in the 20th century organizational bureaucracy.

But the corporate machine wanted him to fit into the way work was done in his organization.

One of his challenges was that as he kept hitting his head against the wall, the only one that was getting a headache was him. Everyone else was simply doing their &ldquo;job.&rdquo; In the end, without having the right person to help him find a new way to bring this project to life, the company would stagnate and become increasingly irrelevant. But who cares enough to make sure systems are aligned to drive innovation? How can we get out of the mainstream and be creative when we are surrounded by antiquated 20th century practices?</p><p> This is exactly where we need to bring common sense back to business by breaking down what works mean, how we do it and redefining our purpose since obviously, all those mission statements are not necessarily helping us innovate.</p><h3> <strong>  Be purposeful and create on the edge </strong></h3><p> What is beautiful about the world we live in is our ability to easily connect with others in the spirit of abundance. Imagine if you created your next strategic roadmap based on abundance? Ask yourself: &ldquo;what is abundant in my business universe?&rdquo; Is it technology, data, people, communities, and/or relationships, for example? And instead of focusing on what is scarce and taking market share away from the competition, what if you created new markets, services or products?</p><p> Millions of dollars are wasted every year bringing people and &ldquo;teams&rdquo; together to retreats where they are talked at. We have lost the common sense power of conversations. Imagine what could happen if we brought together the right people at the right time and had meaningful conversations to co-create solutions and new directions?</p><p> What what would happen if people in organizations focused on solving problems and creating opportunities with shared purpose? The 21st century leader understands that the words on the page don&rsquo;t matter as much as the actions. They know that they can&rsquo;t keep sending out the same rhetoric crafted by their executive communication specialist and expect people to believe in what they are saying. There is still a lot of fear in today&rsquo;s workplace but if you talked honestly with people they will tell you that they simply want to work for a company that means something in the world beyond slogans and symbolic gestures.</p><p> The 21st century leader understands that they need a foundation and an engine to drive their business. They are not layering more and more useless strategies and programs. They don&rsquo;t discuss social fluency and other jargon-laden concepts; instead, they create shared purpose.</p><p> Imagine for one minute that everyone in your organization not only shared in its purpose but also understood their role in making it happen? What would your strategic roadmap look like then and what kind of organization would you need to support it? Most definitely not a hierarchical one that requires a re-org every 18 months. Every organization, no matter its size, need a reason for being.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s you shared purpose? </strong></p><p> It no longer matters what you say you do as much as who you are and what you are creating in the world.</p><p> <strong>  Drive a beta culture: Learning to inhale </strong></p><p> Work as we know it has changed. There is no future of work but an evolution of work. We are witnessing new ways of working that have yet to be captured in business school text books and it&rsquo;s confusing the hell out of the people at &ldquo;the top.&rdquo; While they want to keep up with all the shiny new toys, they are also hanging on to dear life at the same time. I wonder when they&rsquo;ll wake up and realize that all those change management programs are hurting their organization and that all they need is a clear shared purpose that people can internalize. Instead of communicating more and more change and making people more and more overwhelmed, why not share that we will always have change and we will find ways to integrate it rather than manage it?</p><p> For the 21st century organization, communication becomes increasingly important. And no, it&rsquo;s not about delegating to a function that creates stakeholder maps and tactics with messages. That is the old world. In our current world, we need to have conversations with the right people at the right time and bring them together. The new world communicators will help leaders communicate with new tools by helping them become amazing storytellers. And imagine what happens when everyone in the organization can then tell those stories and spread ideas.</p><p> We need to realize that organization change management is an antiquated practice as we no longer need to delegate basic leadership to a function. We need authentic leaders who take people on a journey that includes the good times and the challenging ones because they know who they can bring in at the right time to help solve problems and drive direction.</p><p> Leaders who understand that the world is a fresh new canvass of opportunity are learning to inhale and manage a beta culture that continually evolves and creates.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2.jpeg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p> <strong>  The secret sauce to the 21st century is business common sense: caring, listening, creating, doing, unlearning, learning, relearning and sharing. </strong></p>",

    "title": "Why You're Failing at Social Media Metrics",
    "link": "why-youre-failing-at-social-media-metrics",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.michaelsim.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Sim  </a> </u></p><p> Many companies have taken a very granular and data driven approach to social media analytics, using page likes, follower count, retweets, comments, and other engagements to evaluate their social media performance. Most marketing professionals would start with the average customer lifetime value. Working backwards, they will track conversions from a social source, take note of the average amount of social interactions it took to convert, and then set goals to increase those &ldquo;interactions&rdquo; to boost conversions.</p><p> Basically, it becomes a game of content volume measured by audience engagement. If they don&rsquo;t engage, they won&rsquo;t convert; therefore we&rsquo;ve done something wrong, and we can improve it with more or even better content. This is why a large amount of marketing professionals have difficulty making meaningful connections through social media. Simply put, they&rsquo;re just not socialpeople. They&rsquo;re trained to think in numbers, and they&rsquo;ve built a memory bank full of catchy headlines and elaborate case studies that support traditional marketing and advertising models. To their credit, no other form of traditional or digital media gives you the ability to reach out directly to your target audience and engage them on a personal level.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a good way to understand my point:</p><p> <strong>  Scenario 1: </strong>   This week I&rsquo;ve gained 100 new followers, received 20 retweets, 10 favorites, and 15 replies (Twitter). Last week I gained 50 new followers, received 15 retweets, 5 favorites, and 7 replies (Twitter). I&rsquo;ve doubled our numbers, and somewhere in the future I&rsquo;ll hopefully be able to tie that back to revenue by looking at the Twitter segment in my Google Analytics dashboard.</p><p> <strong>  Scenario 2:  </strong> This week I&rsquo;ve gained 50 new followers and received 10 retweets. I thanked the 10 retweeters, asked them a soft question, and made a connection with them by mentioning something from their bio. Of the 10 I engaged, 5 of them showed interest in my company. Of the 5 that showed interest, I was able to get each of them on the phone, get their email, or simply enter them into my CRM for future follow-up.</p><p> Do you see the difference? While scenario 2 has half the metric growth as scenario 1, it&rsquo;s exponentially more valuable than scenario 1. And this effect works in nearly EVERY business application &ndash; lead generation and acquisition, customer support, and business development.</p><p> From what I&rsquo;ve observed so far, most companies navigating social for the first time seem to treat their social presence as another channel to distribute their marketing materials. They&rsquo;re under the broadcast advertising mindset that by showing their audience enough commercials (over time), it will eventually drive consumers to spend with their company. While they&rsquo;re not 100% incorrect, this path is far more expensive and time consuming to produce any sort of meaningful results than if they were to spend more time growing and connecting with their audience on a personal level.</p><p> That&rsquo;s been the toughest concept that I&rsquo;ve ever had to explain to companies &ndash; turning up the advertising &ldquo;volume&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily produce quality customers. Social media is entirely comprised of opt-in networks, where something as simple as a parent joining is enough for some people to abandon them forever. How do you think people feel being bombarded by your advertising all day long? While you may &ldquo;grow&rdquo; your audience over time, how active are those people in social, how much of an advocate are they for your brand, and what is the likelihood that they will transact with your company? Without a social customer quality model to reference, it&rsquo;s a shot in the dark.</p><p> When I assess a social media contact, I look at a variety of things before I engage them personally. First, how active are they on social? When was their last tweet or update? Do they retweet brands they like, or do they largely talk about themselves? What are they interested in? Do they have the potential to become a brand advocate, or at the very least, a customer? With a 20 second ocular shakedown, you should be able to determine the type of contact and their general value to your company.</p><p> If you reach out to and engage your new followers of value, you&rsquo;ve just created new metrics that mean much more than a simple share or retweet &ndash; the means to track personal engagements and tie them to actual conversions. There&rsquo;s no need to get out your Erlenmeyer flasks and perform some sort of advanced science experiment to document and understand hundreds of different vanity metrics. How many new followers did you get? How many direct engagements did you send out? How many of those engagements resulted in a conversion?</p><p> All of the other vanity metrics only help you to understand your overall influence and connection with your audience. You can certainly document and analyze every single engagement in an Excel Spreadsheet until you&rsquo;re blue in the face, or you can look at your numbers more abstractly and simply make goals to improve your overall influence. You still need a content strategy. You still need to keep a finger on the pulse of your social brand and understand what your audience responds to. However, there&rsquo;s one metric that will consistently outperform nearly any other metric known to man &ndash; the effect of a social &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; and its ability to form a real relationship.</p><p> <strong>  My Workflow </strong></p><p> I only use a handful of tools in order to better understand my social media data in order to make improvements. Twitter Analytics, Facebook Insights, Buffer Analytics, and Google Analytics. Whenever I see a piece of content that I&rsquo;ve created hit a certain &ldquo;peak&rdquo; threshold, I&rsquo;ll take note of the content type, the total engagement, and then put that into a list of top performing posts. Unless it&rsquo;s a contest or a campaign, my goals aren&rsquo;t to exponentially increase engagements and then compare one post against the another &ndash; it&rsquo;s simply to become more aware of what my audience responds to. And by creating content that my audience responds to, their social activity with my content will attract more relevant followers that I can directly engage. I can then use the engagement metrics listed above to track my progress and tie it to the customer lifetime value. This is how I am able to prove social ROI.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Research tells us that one of the most common reasons for clients jumping ship to a new advisor is due to lack of communication; yet many firms don&rsquo;t have a formal communication plan in place.</p><p> The number of ways to communicate with clients has transformed over the past decade - from a traditional mailing or phone call, to email, social media, audio recordings, and other virtual communication methods. With many different options available, one would think communicating has become easier. In retrospect, the challenge lies in determining which method or channel is best and how often to communicate with clients.</p><p> Advisors who have taken time to survey clients and prospects find a mix of communication preferences specifically between differing generations. Baby Boomers may prefer traditional mail while Gen X and Gen Y often prefer a tech savvy approach to communication.</p><p> <strong>  Client communication is a key component in your business and marketing plan. A solid communication strategy will increase: </strong></p><li> Client retention</li><li> Client satisfaction</li><li> Referrals</li><p> Creating a successful communication plan will enhance client relationships provided you determine what communication methods clients prefer and expect versus methods that are easiest for your firm.</p><p> Successful advisors have a communication process in place to strengthen relationships, provide valuable information based on client needs, and follow the communication preferences of clients and prospects.  </p><p> Providing newsletters and market updates on a regular basis is a good practice and can typically be shared with your entire client database. To create stronger relationships and gain trust and credibility, provide targeted information based on client needs and through the communication channel of their choice.</p><p> <strong>  Here are five ways you can improve your client communication plan: </strong></p><li> <p>  <strong>   Survey your clients:   </strong>  Determine your clients preferred method of communication by providing a menu of options of what you can provide - mail, email, group conference calls, podcasts, social media, etc. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Pinpoint client needs:  </strong>  Provide educational material based on the needs of your clients and prospects. Generalized information is acceptable; however, understanding the challenges clients are facing and then providing them with specific and valuable information in relation to their challenges will position you as a go-to-advisor and increase your referral pipeline. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Create a communication calendar:   </strong>  Identify the type of information you will deliver, example: newsletters, market calls, and educational articles based on need. Provide updates to clients via their communication preference. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Track email opens and clicks:  </strong>   Most email programs will provide data to determine what percentage of your emails are being opened. Resend your email to those clients or prospects that did not open the email after a 72 hour period. Tip - review your subject line and modify it to grab their attention. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Talk to your clients:  </strong>  Take time to simply find out how things are going. Allow time for clients to ask questions and get to know them outside of &ldquo;portfolio review time.&rdquo; </p></li><p> How often do you communicate with clients and which methods of communication are working best for your firm?

    "title": "White Zinfandel and the Best White Wine You're Not Drinking",
    "link": "white-zinfandel-and-the-best-white-wine-youre-not-drinking",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Back in the 1970s, Sutter Home Winery found themselves with a surplus of Zinfandel grapes and a demand for increased white wine production. The answer? White Zinfandel! You know, the stuff that dominates store aisle end-caps and bad office parties. These wines scarcely sold when they were labeled as \"Blush Wines.\" Later on, however, the wines were marketed as \"White Zinfandel\" and somehow became a huge commercial success. So what's the problem? The problem is that the best part of the Zinfandel grape is the skin. Both Zinfandel and White Zinfandel wines are made from the same grape. When [Red] Zinfandel is made, the skin is allowed to remain in contact with the crushed juice long enough to impart deep color, tannins, and structure. When White Zinfandel is made, however, the grape skin is discarded early, leaving behind a light pink juice. What you are left with is a dubious and insipid beverage. It's akin to eating a banana peel and throwing away the banana. </p><p> Some people like it anyway and I suspect it's because of its inherent sweetness. So let's talk about the sweet wine you might consider drinking in its place, German Riesling. Imagine another sweet white wine with enough acid and complexity to bolster its sweetness. They are great now, but in the early years...not so much!  In the 1950s, it was common to add table sugar to these wines because of their awful bitterness. Worse still, the reintroduction of these wines into the U.S. market during the 1970s conjures up images of the then-popular Blue Nun and Black Tower  <i>  Liebfraumilch </i> , which translated means \"Milk of the Blessed Mother.\" Strict labeling and improved quality have made modern German Riesling the go-to wine in today's market. It's not an exaggeration to say that they are now among the most delicious, versatile, and user-friendly wines in the world. </p><p> What makes Riesling wines versatile? Generally speaking, they have low alcohol levels, plenty of sweetness, and a palate-cleansing acidity that can either match the richness of certain dishes or \"cut through\" them as necessary.  The French sometimes refer to Riesling as a \"Repair Wine\" because of its innate ability to refresh and rejuvenate a fatigued palate. </p><p> I wouldn't presume to bore you with verbose descriptions of German wine terms and regions. Rather, the goal here is to give you a simple take-away that you can put to use immediately--that take-away is  <i>  Riesling Sp&auml;tlese </i> .  <i>  Sp&auml;tlese </i>  (pronounced: Shpate-lazuh), is a designation of quality and ripeness that can be found on certain bottles of German Riesling. German Riesling has a sort of ripeness/sweetness continuum beginning with the least ripened,  <i>  Tafelwein </i>  (Table Wine) and ending with the most ripened,  <i>  Eiswein </i> (Ice Wine). Sp&auml;tlese falls somewhere in the didactic middle--a sort of  <i>  John McCain </i>  of Riesling. Strictly speaking, It represents one of the best quality-to-price ratios. It's hard to imagine a better white wine at its price point.  </p><p> So what's the most unusual thing about Riesling, other than the fact that it always seems to be made by \"Doctors\" with the initials \"J.J.?\" It's the fact that no one is drinking it. OK, people drink it, but when you go to the local wine shop, it is usually relegated to a small section on a corner shelf. Finding the German wine section in any store is an onerous task, but those seeking out these well-made wines will be vastly rewarded! </p><p> <strong>  Author's Picks: </strong></p><p> '13 Donnhoff Oberhauser Brucke Riesling Sp&auml;tlese $47.99 <br/> '12 J.J. Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Riesling Sp&auml;tlese $39.99</p>",

    "content": "<p> I heard an old proverb once that went something like, &ldquo;Let everyone leave the marketplace with a little silver in their pocket.&rdquo; In other words, make sure there is a fair deal. The concern for this reaches back across the millennia. In fact, there are stories of clerics who would travel from town to town in ancient days to make sure that the weights on scales had not been altered or tampered with.</p><p> In the complex world of investing, careers will ultimately rise or fall to the extent there is complete transparency in each transaction. Put another way, symmetry of information between buyer and seller, salesperson and client. Here&rsquo;s a simple test. Next time you&rsquo;re at a gathering of some kind, ask a few folks if they can describe the way their financial advisor is paid. Is there an embedded commission? Do they know how much it is? How it&rsquo;s calculated? The bottom line is that when all the facts are on the table&mdash;and both parties still agree to go ahead with a transaction&mdash;there is symmetry of information. And that means there is integrity in the relationship.</p><p> Recently, we have seen a number of jurisdictions introduce various forms of crowdfunding, whereby start-up ventures, often with little more in the way of a business plan than a concept, can raise capital to start their enterprise. The potential is there for some great new businesses to get the equity funding that they really need. There is also the risk of abuse and fraud. There is certainly the risk that plain disclosure and a thorough discussion of the risk (e.g. &ldquo;could you handle it if you lost ALL your money in this venture?&rdquo;) may not be sufficiently robust.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the most amazing thing. Taking the time to explain everything, and then confirming it all in writing, will make you the talk of the town &ndash; in the most positive way imaginable. You will build lasting relationships with people who keep coming back to you&mdash;in the great deals and also the ones that don&rsquo;t turn out so well.</p>",

Because that is a lame-ass boring goal.</p><p> But, if your goal is: &ldquo;to eat healthy so that you feel great, have more energy for fun things, stop wasting money on takeout, and save money for your upcoming vacation&rdquo; you&rsquo;re way more likely to achieve it.</p><p> Why?</p><p> Because your reasons to push through your discomfort are compelling, time-sensitive, and motivating.</p><p> When you have good reasons, you're armed and ready for when the couch calls your name, you&rsquo;re scared of failure, or your old fears pop back up. All you need to do is review your list of why your best self wants you to get off the couch.</p><p> <strong>  THE TIME TO MOTIVATE YOURSELF ISN&rsquo;T WHEN YOU&rsquo;RE FEELING SHITTY. IT&rsquo;S NOW. </strong></p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s simple: </strong></p><li> Come up with reasons why achieving your goal gets you to where you want to be.</li><li> Come up with reasons why not achieving it so far has held you back.</li><li> Look at your list often. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The Takeaway: </strong></p><p> Get good reasons and then build your motivation muscle.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/s/Goal-Motivation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Download the worksheet here  </a> </u></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/blog.aspx?author=Chris%20Toman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Chris Toman </a>  | <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ecova  </u> </a></p><p> In a previous blog post, I explored California&rsquo;s recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/ecova/blog/2014/november/business-impacts-of-california's-new-plastic-bag-ban.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   statewide plastic bag ban  </a> </u>  and how it impacts businesses. Today, I&rsquo;ll take a closer look at another piece of legislation that will affect many businesses operating in the Golden State―a statewide commercial composting requirement. California&rsquo;s enactment of the bill marks the fourth time a composting requirement has passed at the state level. Previous composting laws have been enacted in Massachusetts, Vermont, and Connecticut.</p><p> <strong>  WHAT IS COMPOST? </strong></p><p> Compost can refer to either a municipal organic waste collection program or to the nutrient-rich fertilizer that&rsquo;s a byproduct of such programs. It&rsquo;s common to refer to the process of sorting and collecting organic waste as composting, but it can also be called &ldquo;organic recycling.&rdquo;</p><p> Items accepted in the composting bin varies depending on your location and hauling company, but generally accepted items include food scraps, like banana peels, egg shells, or coffee grounds, and food-soiled paper, like napkins and pizza boxes. In many places, meat scraps and bones are also accepted. Specially designed single-use disposable service ware can also be compostable, though it&rsquo;s important to check with your processor about specific items.</p><p> <strong>  DETAILS ABOUT CALIFORNIA&rsquo;S COMMERCIAL COMPOST REQUIREMENT </strong></p><p> In late September 2014, California&rsquo;s Governor, Jerry Brown, signed into law a bill that will require any business in the state with 8 cubic yards of organic waste per week to arrange for composting service, beginning April 1, 2016. On January 1, 2017, the threshold for requiring a business to compost will fall to 4 cubic yards per week of organic waste.</p><p> The exact enforcement measures, penalties for noncompliance, and program details have not yet been determined and will vary across the state. The new law will be implemented at the local level, meaning it will be up to individual jurisdictions and municipalities to enforce the new regulation and implement composting programs. Local agencies are required to report to the state on their progress by January 1, 2016.  </p><p> <strong>  WHY REQUIRE BUSINESSES &ndash; OR ANYONE &ndash; TO COMPOST? </strong></p><p> The growing number of new composting measures is the result of a complex blend of public and private forces. However, at its core are significant environmental and financial incentives―and businesses that commit to a robust composting program can often save money.</p><p> <strong>  CLIMATE CHANGE: REDUCE EMISSIONS AND INCREASE RENWABLE ENERGY </strong></p><p> In landfills, organic matter breaks down without the presence of oxygen. This process is known as anaerobic digestion. The byproduct of anaerobic digestion is methane, a greenhouse gas that is  <u>  <a href=\"http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html\" target=\"_blank\">   over 20 times more efficient at trapping heat than carbon dioxide  </a> </u> . In short, that means the organic waste we send to the landfill contributes to climate change by releasing methane into the atmosphere. According to the EPA, landfills are the source of 18 percent of all methane emissions.</p><p> Conversely, composting allows oxygen to circulate through organic waste as it breaks down through a process known as aerobic digestion that releases trace amounts of carbon dioxide. Reducing the amount of food and organic waste from being sent to the landfill is a simple way for organizations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> <strong>  HEALTHY SOIL AND CLEAN WATER </strong></p><p> Aside from reducing greenhouse gasses, composting organic waste offers a number of other environmental benefits. The nutrient-rich fertilizer that&rsquo;s a byproduct of municipal composting programs is a valuable soil that can be used locally by farmers, the public, or governments to improve parks and community spaces.</p><p> In addition, healthy soil can have a big impact on water quality. When it rains, pollutants are washed into rivers, lakes, and oceans through storm water drainage systems. Governments and other organizations are utilizing low-cost compost as a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sandiego.gov/environmental-services/pdf/miramar/CompostStormwaterManagement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   natural filter  </a> </u>  that protects water resources.</p><p> <strong>  FINCANCIAL BENEFITS: SAVE MONEY </strong></p><p> Finally, composting locally is often cheaper than sending materials to a landfill. Waste costs are  <u>  <a href=\"http://app.link.penton3.com/e/er?YM_RID=CPEQW000001134601&amp;YM_MID=1484&amp;s=1587191664&amp;lid=4974&amp;elq=220504690ba54a6f8d71c596330a0f9d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rising  </a> </u> . Collecting, transporting, and regulating waste that goes to a landfill is expensive and produces little or no additional value. In many places, reducing trash service and adding compost service often results in lower waste bills for businesses and governments alike. And with so much of our waste being organic, there&rsquo;s potential for big savings.</p><p> <strong>  COMPOSTING REGULATIONS: A CONTINUING TREND </strong></p><p> The continued focus on climate change at the local and statewide level, the environmental benefits, and the financial savings for governments and businesses alike have led to the growing number of municipalities that are separating organics from trash.  As states like California prove composting regulations can reduce costs and improve the environment, other states may follow.</p><p> If your business is interested in reducing its waste expenses or ensuring they comply with local regulations,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/contact-us.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contact Ecova  </a> </u>  for assistance in setting up a companywide composting program.

Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean giving up on most of what you believe to be true or what you desire? </p><p> <strong>  Being liked by everyone </strong></p><p> This would almost require giving up on your own dreams and preferred path.

Both perspectives are deserving of appreciation.</p><p> <strong>  Difficult meetings </strong></p><p> The next time you are in a difficult meeting with a potential client or hiring manager, and their perspective is quite different from yours, stop for a moment to reconsider.

    "content": "<p> Written by: Dean Gorman | <a href=\"http://www.aha-writers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Aha-Writers  </u> </a></p><p> <u>  A few weeks ago </u> , we looked at some data points that make a compelling case for investing in email marketing. Now we&rsquo;ll explore current trends to help you make the most of this tried-and-true channel.</p><p> Whether you realize it or not, the way you engage with email has changed significantly over the past few years. Along with the rest of the digital world, email is evolving at a dizzying pace&mdash;with marketing automation, integration with apps and social networks, and the rapid growth of mobile technology.</p><p> <strong>  Mobile first or bust </strong></p><p> No question about it&mdash;if you want to optimize your email marketing program today, one of the first things you should focus on is the mobile experience. Of the 247 billion emails sent every day,  <u>  <a href=\"https://litmus.com/blog/48-of-emails-are-opened-on-mobile-gmail-opens-down-20-since-tabs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   48 percent  </a> </u>  are now opened on a mobile device. Worldwide,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2013-2017-Executive-Summary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   897 million people  </a> </u>  use mobile devices for business and personal email.</p><p> To set yourself up for success in the mobile environment, start by focusing on the following areas:</p><li> Responsive design: Mobile-optimized content isn&rsquo;t just nice to have; it&rsquo;s a requirement as more and more people use smartphones and tablets for email.</li><li> Targeted content: Mobile attention spans are shorter than ever. Emails need to offer useful, relevant content and get to the point quickly.</li><li> Clear subject lines: Cryptic subject lines are easy to scroll past or select for deletion; subjects should be straightforward and short enough to be read on a small screen.</li><li> The pre-header/preview: The text that appears after the subject line when you scroll through your inbox is prime real estate. Why let it default to utility text like &ldquo;Having trouble viewing this email?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Make it social </strong></p><p> Another way to modernize your approach to email marketing is by integrating your email and social media. Rather than just tacking a few social icons onto the end of your email, challenge yourself to truly integrate the programs. Encourage users from your social channels to subscribe to your email newsletter and vice versa. Entice each side with sneak peeks or exclusive content from the other channel.</p><p> <strong>  Personalize to optimize </strong></p><p> Your audience is evermore leery of marketing and increasingly savvy about avoiding it&mdash;or at least controlling the way it intersects with their life. So marketers must do the hard work of finding ways to make their content personal, highly relevant and worth a reader&rsquo;s time.</p><p> Be creative, and think outside of the usual email tactics. Give your audience incentives by holding contests, polls and quizzes, or giving out prizes. And the great thing about email interaction is that you can measure it and capture leads at the same time.</p><p> <strong>  The takeaway </strong></p><p> As customer behaviors change and mobile continues its rise, we as marketers need to stay on our toes. We need to evolve as fast as the technology that drives the behavior changes.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t the end of the road for email&mdash;it&rsquo;s more like a fork. You can either adapt your approach to meet these new challenges (and reap the new rewards) or continue down the old path and slowly but surely watch your audience go dark. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frugalplanner\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Chuck Donalies, CFP  </u> </a></p><p> I think it&rsquo;s safe to say all parents want their children to possess financial skills that will allow them to be happy and successful in life. The problem is not every parent has strong personal financial skills to share with his or her child. That&rsquo;s understandable because we all have different strengths and weaknesses. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t count on our kids learning these important skills in school because many schools no longer teach basic personal finance!</p><p> So what&rsquo;s a parent to do? A quick Google search will provide you with many ideas, but you&rsquo;re busy and you may not have time to research this subject. Luckily, I&rsquo;m here to share four ways to make managing money a regular part of their lives. In fact, my wife and I use the following methods with our girls (now five and seven):</p><li> <strong>  Allowance: </strong>  There are many questions that need to be answered before giving your child an allowance. What does the child have to do in order to earn the allowance? How much should you give them? In our case, we expect the girls to keep their rooms clean, do their homework, etc. They have to go above and beyond basic family responsibilities to earn their allowance.</li><li> <strong>  Learn by Doing:  </strong> Sometimes the best way to learn something is simply by doing it. If you want your child to become an active and effective money manager you need to allow them to manage money. Our girls receive their allowance as cash. They&rsquo;re taught how to organize it and to keep it secure.</li><li> <strong>  The Bucket Approach:  </strong> Once your child has money you need to determine how much freedom they have to spend it. We decided to teach our girls to manage their money in &ldquo;buckets&rdquo;. Their weekly allowance must be divided up between Saving, Giving, and Spending. Bonus: It&rsquo;s not unusual to find our girls pooling resources from their Spending bucket to buy treats at the local farmers market. I believe this further improves their sharing and negotiating skills.</li><li> <strong>  Gift Cards:  </strong> It can be easy to lose sight of the cash value of a gift card. I&rsquo;ve found it best to talk about the amount of money on the card with the child prior to going shopping. Once you&rsquo;re at the store, the child can weigh the pros and cons of buying whatever they want. This is a great way to introduce the concept of the opportunity cost (i.e., the difference in value between a chosen item and one that must be passed up).</li><p> In the end, keeping the process fun is key to keeping your child engaged and learning. They may not like having to give things up, but they will enjoy having the freedom to make calculated financial decisions.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Scarlett @ <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BubbleJobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BubbleJobs  </a> </u></p><p> The working world is full of lots of weird and wonderful people that need to be able to work together. An important person to get on with in the workplace is the boss because, at the end of the day, they&rsquo;re the person that can have a big impact on your career progression</p><p> But unfortunately things don&rsquo;t always run smoothly and you can find that your boss hasn&rsquo;t got the best management style in the world. If this is the case then you need to make sure that you deal with the situation appropriately. To help you out, we&rsquo;ve come up with six tips on how to deal with a difficult boss.</p><p> <strong>  Make Sure That It&rsquo;s Not You </strong></p><p> This might be a difficult one to admit to, but before you get all worked up, make sure that it&rsquo;s not you being a tad sensitive. Remember that the business world can be a tough place and your boss will probably be a busy person &ndash; so if they don&rsquo;t always behave exactly how they should, try not to take it too personally.</p><p> Your boss&rsquo; main role is to guide you and make sure that you&rsquo;re doing what you should, not to be your best friend. That said; if your boss&rsquo; behaviour is out of order, then you need to deal with it in the right manner!</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t Let Them Get In The Way Of Your Work Performance </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re working under poor management, then it&rsquo;s very easy to throw the towel in and stop putting your all into your work &ndash; but this is probably the worse thing you could do, as it shines you in a bad light.</p><p> If there are any problems in the future with your boss you want to show that you&rsquo;re squeaky clean, not that you&rsquo;ve given in. So make sure you stay ahead of the game and get your work done &ndash; this will help you out in the long run.</p><p> <strong>  Give It A Bit Of Time </strong></p><p> We all have bad days, weeks or even months where family issues or other external things might affect your performance in the work place. If your boss has suddenly started acting out of the ordinary or being a little abrupt with you, there may be a valid reason why.</p><p> So before you go to someone above your manager or make any rash decisions, give it a bit of time. It may be that your boss is busy and needs to get on top of things or they may have other problems.</p><p> <strong>  Learn To Adapt </strong></p><p> You should never suffer in silence with these sorts of matters, but if there are ways of making your boss&rsquo; life easier then try and do it. Remember, everyone is different, so it&rsquo;s important to adapt to suit each other. If you can bite your lip or put that little bit more effort in then make sure you do it &ndash; this could really help you out in the long run.</p><p> <strong>  Keep A Record Of Communication </strong></p><p> If your boss has been difficult for a month or so and you feel that they may be behaving inappropriately, then you need to make sure that you keep a log of your communication. This means that if you ever need to discuss any issues in the future then you&rsquo;ve got some hard evidence of what&rsquo;s been going on.</p><p> <strong>  Keep Professional </strong></p><p> This is the most important one out of all of the previous points &ndash; if your boss is behaving inappropriately then do not lower yourself to their level. It can be difficult to not get emotional about the situation &ndash; because that&rsquo;s how you would deal with it in a personal circumstance, but you have to remember that you&rsquo;re in the workplace. So no matter what, keep your cool and your professionalism &ndash;  this will stop any issues escalating into a full blown row!</p>",

    "title": "Trust vs. Performance: a False Choice",
    "link": "trust-vs-performance-a-false-choice",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Trust underpins any important, sustainable relationship.  Your relationship with your investment adviser is no different: before you let anyone craft and manage your investment portfolio, you must trust them implicitly.  But you should also care about their professional competence &ndash; specifically, their risk-adjusted performance over time.</p><p> Unfortunately, trust and performance have long been treated as competing, or at least incompatible, criteria in the hiring or retaining of an investment adviser.  This a false choice - we believe performance can and should be a fundamental component of the trust you place in your adviser. </p><p> <strong>  On Trust </strong></p><p> Trust is clearly a basic and necessary condition for hiring an investment adviser. Indeed,  <u>  Registered Investment Advisers (RIA) </u>  typically solicit clients based on  <u>  <a href=\"http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/2/577.short\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trust, experience, and dependability  </a> </u> .  This trust is typically based on personal relationships, mutual friends and colleagues, socio-economic closeness, or persuasive communication, and rarely on any objective assessment of the adviser&rsquo;s practice. </p><p> Let&rsquo;s first distinguish between two types of client &lsquo;trust&rsquo; in investment advisers.  The first is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/sapienza/htm/social_capital.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   security from expropriation or theft  </a> </u> .  Such trust should be a given: it is absurd that an investor should choose among advisers based on which adviser is least likely to steal their savings.  Notwithstanding the media frenzy around isolated cases like the Madoff scam, advisory clients enjoy significant legal and regulatory protection from fraud.  Strong securities laws, verifiable national and state registrations, background checks, and separate custody of client assets, all limit outright criminality in wealth management. </p><p> There is, however, another aspect of trust,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18174\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recently explored  </a> </u>  in the finance literature, which has to do with &ldquo;reducing investor anxiety about taking risk.&rdquo;  Here, investors &lsquo;trust&rsquo; advisers to take risks with their investment portfolio that they are not willing &ndash; due to a real or perceived lack of knowledge or discipline &ndash; to take themselves.  Even if they can invest directly with some competence, investors gain significant value from &lsquo;outsourcing&rsquo; their risky investment decisions to an expert whom they trust.  Absent this trust, they would not be invested in risk-appropriate assets based on their life circumstances and goals.  So, by psychologically allowing clients to take appropriate investment risk, trust becomes a legitimate and central part of the client-adviser relationship, and one that grows with time. </p><p> (Note: Any &lsquo;anxiety-reducing&rsquo; value that an adviser offers a client is separate from the value a client derives from  <u>  asset allocation </u> ,  <u>  diversification </u> , or outperformance, all of which taken together should determine whether an adviser is worth the fees they charge.)  </p><p> <strong>  On Performance </strong></p><p> Risk-adjusted performance, properly measured, should theoretically determine competition among advisers for client assets.  Over time,  <a href=\"http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/114/2/389.short\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   funds should flow to better performing advisers  </u>  ,  </a>  and advisers should compete over fees, services (increased breadth or greater specialization), or both.  Yet this could not be further from the actual outcome.  If mutual fund performance is any indication of investment adviser performance,  <u>  <a href=\"http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/114/2/389.short\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the worst performers tend to charge the highest fees  </a> </u> .</p><p> So why do clients all but ignore performance when choosing an adviser?  There are two major causes.  First, the performance data itself are largely absent.  The wealth management industry lacks a third-party, objective, centralized database of adviser performance at any level.  Even where data are collected, they to be at the aggregate level across clients, or in the form of model portfolios.  Since each client typically has a unique investment mandate and special investment goals and financial circumstances, performance data aggregated across diverse clients is unhelpful.  Model portfolios are a  <u>  poor substitute </u>  for client-level data.  And to complicate matters further, investment advisers are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/clovercapital102886.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   legally limited  </a> </u>  in how they can calculate and publish performance-related information.   </p><p> But issues with capturing and analyzing performance data, while significant, are surmountable &ndash; we&rsquo;ve done it here at Finom.  There is a actually deeper, underlying reason why advisers are averse to sharing and &lsquo;leading with&rsquo; their performance.  It is simply  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18174\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not in their financial interest  </a> </u>  to do so.  The logic is straightforward.  If manager-specific trust empowers advisers to invest client wealth in risky assets, and if advisers generally charge based on the riskiness of the investments they manage, then advisers have every incentive to invest in &lsquo;hot&rsquo; (increasingly risky) assets to earn higher fees.  Since &lsquo;hot&rsquo; asset classes historically underperform &lsquo;value&rsquo; or even benchmark indices, advisers underperform their benchmarks in the long run, especially after fees and expenses.  And who wants to &lsquo;lead with&rsquo; underperformance in a client meeting? </p><p> Perversely, the riskier the portfolio, the more the client &lsquo;trusts&rsquo; the adviser, and the less likely she is to fire a poor performer.  And worse, rather than speaking truth to money and risk reducing such trust (and fees),  advisers may pander to clients who like &lsquo;hot&rsquo; assets, thereby building even greater trust (and earning even higher fees).  This dynamic reduces investor mobility to better performing managers, ensures high fees, and cements the gravitational pull that large advisers exercise over client assets.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  EXT Marketing </u></p><p> When it comes to financial services marketing, deep product knowledge matters. Why? Because the industry is undergoing constant regulatory and product change, and knowing how it all fits together is essential to continued success.</p><p> We believe that  <u>  continuing education is important </u>  for your long-term growth. This post illustrates, however, why deep product knowledge is essential for you and your company right now.</p><p> <strong>  The changes </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;ve identified three key areas where industry changes are taking place:</p><p> 1. More regulation</p><p> Nowadays &ndash; with CRM-2, point of sale and debates about fiduciary duty happening all at once &ndash; it seems that a significant regulatory development occurs almost every week. Staying on top of these changes is important in order to keep your business &ndash; from your sales and marketing teams to your advisors and clients &ndash; moving forward without any unwanted surprises. </p><p> 2. Greater complexity</p><p> Investment solutions &ndash; and services for that matter &ndash; are getting more complicated, and having insights into the competitive landscape is more than just helpful, it&rsquo;s mandatory.</p><p> 3. Audience diversity</p><p> &ldquo;One size fits all&rdquo; does not work anymore. Whether they are retail investors, institutional investors, advisors or executives, people want solutions to help them meet their unique needs.</p><p> <strong>  The need for knowledge </strong></p><p> Last year we wrote about SAVE marketing. SAVE stands for &ldquo;solutions, access, value and education.&rdquo; We think that, in many ways, it&rsquo;s a more effective way for financial services marketers to think than the traditional 4P (product, price, promotion and place) approach.</p><p> So how does deep product knowledge inform the SAVE marketing approach? These four questions make it pretty clear:</p><p> 1. How can you frame a  <u>  solution </u>  if you don&rsquo;t know the audience? <br/> 2. How can you ensure effective  <u>  access </u>  without a thorough understanding of operations? <br/> 3. How can you offer true  <u>  value </u>  if you don&rsquo;t know the competitive landscape? <br/> 4. How can you  <u>  educate </u>  clients without a deep knowledge of your solutions?</p><p> What does this amount to? Before planning a product launch, drafting a creative brief for a web series or starting any other important project, make sure that the people at your table know the industry &ndash; where it&rsquo;s been, where it is today and where it&rsquo;s going.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Aaron Friedman | <a href=\"http://blog.principal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Principal Financial  </u> </a></p><p> I recently wrote a blog post about seven administrative sins. I started thinking about the number 7, which is usually considered lucky; however, it seems there are a lot of lists of seven things that are negative. Whether it&rsquo;s seven administrative sins, seven deadly sins, or the seven words you can&rsquo;t say on television, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of lists showing seven positive things. I will therefore take it upon myself to list seven positive questions that should be asked of non-profit retirement plan sponsors.</p><li> Does your organization&rsquo;s management and board feel confident with the plan&rsquo;s governance and their own responsibilities as plan fiduciaries? Too often in a non-profit organization, the management and board are not even aware that they are fiduciaries.</li><li> Who is helping you with your fiduciary due diligence? The fact of the matter is that a typical non-profit is focused on its mission, and is typically not an expert on fiduciary duties related to its retirement plan. In fact  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.principal.com/2014/10/22/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   some organizations believe their provider is handling that  </a> </u> . Non-profit organizations are in need of help from qualified financial professionals.</li><li> Do you have an investment policy statement and review process in place? This is part of prudent governance and a fiduciary best practice. It&rsquo;s also surprising how many organizations don&rsquo;t have investment policies in place.</li><li> Do you have an education policy in place? Too often, non-profit organizations simply rely on vendor representatives selling product in the cafeteria. There is no consistency of messages, or direction from the plan sponsor.</li><li> What challenges has your organization faced as a result of plan regulatory changes. The answers could range from administrative challenges coordinating information from multiple providers, so problems with Form 5500 and the annual audit.</li><li> If your plan uses multiple providers, or has  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.principal.com/2013/04/18/clean-up-the-clutter-legacy-assets-leave-behind/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   legacy plan assets with multiple providers  </a> </u> , how do you coordinate appropriate administration? Challenges here range from the well-known problems with loans and  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.principal.com/2013/11/01/the-seven-403b-administrative-sins-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hardship distributions  </a> </u> , to lesser considered  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.principal.com/2014/01/31/whose-money-is-it-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   complications with QDROs  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.principal.com/2013/10/18/the-seven-403b-administrative-sins-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   small amount force-outs  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.principal.com/2013/12/06/whose-money-is-it-anyway/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   beneficiary designations  </a> </u> .</li><li> How are you measuring the success of your plan? How are you ensuring that your plan is effectively getting your employees to save for retirement? A retirement plan should be making employees &lsquo;retirement-ready&rsquo;. Does the plan sponsor even know if the plan is effective?</li><p> The answers to these questions can tell you where a particular non-profit organization likely needs the most help with their retirement plan. Financial professionals are well positioned to help sort through the complexity. Otherwise we could be seeing non-profits drowning in the seven seas, when it would be easier to help get them to seventh heaven.</p>",

Organizations that are able to understand and act on the data &ndash; based on analytics,  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/cxm-the-x-factor-in-return-on-relationship/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   but with the relationship at the forefront  </a> </u>  &ndash; will emerge as winners.</p><p> Social media, cloud and mobile have added a layer of urgency to the big data wave. As the velocity of information increases, there&rsquo;s a need to process the data, analyze it for use cases that matter to a business and to make strategic decisions based on those insights. However, gathering real-time data from various structured and unstructured sources and analyzing it is not easy, especially while keeping it human at the same time.</p><p> Smarter organizations understand this and invest in people, process and technology that enable them to use real-time analytics for strategic and operational benefits, while always keeping relationship enhancement at the forefront. Real-time analytics is not just for smarter marketing, but also for cutting inefficiency from operations, improving customer service and for watching trends that can impact the bottom line.</p><p> <strong>  Operations | Customer Service </strong></p><p> A technology service provider wanted to transform its reputation from a slow, sleepy company to one that is nimble, customer-responsive and attentive. They started by setting up teams that worked in two shifts, ensuring continuous and timely review and response. Next, they looked for a product that could provide social listening, real-time analytics such as share of voice, sentiments and time-to-resolution, workflow and reporting for their needs. After they selected the product and trained their team on it, they also defined the processes and business rules for handling and coordinating customer queries, issues and rants&hellip; and how to properly engage.</p><p> By using real-time analytics and organizing teams and processes for real-time response, their social customer service team was able to make a big impact on their customers as well as improve their brand reputation.</p><p> &ldquo;Your Brand/Business is what you do; your Reputation is what people Remember and Share&rdquo;   &ndash;   <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tedrubin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @TedRubin  </a> </u></p><p> The real-time response management and the ability to analyze their interactions provided them unprecedented insights into their customer&rsquo;s issues, attitudes and behavior. For example, using social analytics, the team identified online influencers and brand champions and prioritized response to their concerns.</p><p> Real-time analytics was also of tremendous value to see any emerging issues (service down in a geography or delays in meeting service levels) and to prepare for responding to any incidents.</p><p> Along with operational benefits, the company also monitored their competitors and observed their weaknesses and strengths, in real-time. They were able to generate leads from customers who were unhappy with the competition or those who just moved into the target geography.</p><p> Within a few months, this company went from just another Internet and cable services provider to one that was considered agile, sensitive to customer needs and that responded to their customers within minutes of their post. They not only made their customer happy but also lifted their brand value and their status as a company where the relationship counts &ndash; all by smart use of real-time analytics. The company that provided their platform, worked with their team, and helped customize it for their specific uses was  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mutualmind.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MutualMind  </a> </u> .</p>",

The question becomes who is ultimately responsible for monitoring and seeing it out to completion?</p><p> <strong>  The answer is&hellip; </strong></p><p> Development is a partnership. I don&rsquo;t know when employees became so entitled that they completely removed themselves from this process, but let the madness cease. Yes, it is ideal and reasonable to expect that your employer have strategies to develop their talent. It is equally impressive if they develop the plan, execute and follow-up with each person on their progress without any reminders or nudges from the employees.</p><p> The reality is most of us our functioning in our businesses in less than ideal or reasonable conditions. The workloads are never-ending and the best intentions are never realized because of time constraints and diminishing resources. With this premise as our reality, it is both unfair and unreasonable to believe that the responsibility for development of employees lies solely with the employer.</p><p> Employees more than ever have to become their own strongest advocates both in the office and out. Waiting for recognition, kudos or new opportunities within your company are no longer commonplace. If you want more responsibility, you have to come to the table with why you should be given more as well as the plan to move your potential promotion ahead. If your immediate supervisor is astute and dedicated enough to address development at all, you, the employee needs to be prepared to hold him or her to task by being an active participant in your own development.</p><p> <strong>  Is it reasonable for today&rsquo;s managers to manage individual development plans? </strong></p><p> The answer is it depends on your organization and circumstances. Looking at development from the lens of an employer-employee partnership alleviates a lot of the pressure off your managers and puts the employee in the driver seat of their development. When both the employee and employer are excited, dedicated and willing to partner to meet development milestones you have a win-win situation for everyone.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Trust Owned Life Insurance </strong> (TOLI) is insurance that resides inside a trust. It enables the trust to provide money for survivors to cover estate tax planning and distribute inheritances among heirs. As with any trust, there must be a trustee who is responsible for managing the trust&rsquo;s assets and ensuring its continued vitality.`</p><p> In the case of a TOLI, a trustee is usually one of the following:</p><li> a bank</li><li> a fiduciary</li><li> a financial professional</li><li> family members, including: <br/> - adult children of elderly parents <br/> - parents of minor children <br/> - a spouse <br/>  </li><p> One of the fiduciary responsibilities of a trustee is to review all assets within the trust including any life insurance policies. Unfortunately, many trustees, particularly those family members who are not legal or financial professionals, lack the acumen and resources to complete these types of needed reviews. This can be a big problem for several reasons.</p><p> If the trustee is not performing his or her fiduciary responsibilities, the assets within the trust may not be well-maintained or managed, and may not be performing as well as they could be. There could even be legal recourse against a trustee if the fiduciary responsibilities go unfulfilled.</p><p> In order to avoid this situation, the trustee needs to be reviewing (or having a financial professional review) all insurance policies within the trust at a minimum of every 3-4 years, and asking the following questions:</p><p> <strong>  1. Does the trust meet the beneficiary&rsquo;s needs and objectives? </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. Is the policy benefit-driven or cash-value-driven? </strong></p><p> When we review these types of trusts, we often use in-force illustrations to see whether the trust&rsquo;s policies are matching or exceeding expected market performance. We assess changes in the health of all relevant parties, and review the current and likely future strength of the carrier of a policy.</p><p> We also look at the potential of a policy to lapse prematurely and confirm that the premium schedule is on track. We review all of the trust documents and provide a full analysis to make it easy for a trustee to understand exactly where things stand.</p><p> <strong>  When working with RIAs </strong> , we return a very concise report that outlines any potential problems with the the trust and provides recommendations on any opportunities to improve its financial performance. This guidance is included in our service model for RIAs; we have an expert team of estate planning attorneys that we coordinate with to provide a full suite of services around trust owned policies. It is critical that these policies not go ignored or overlooked simply because many trustees are confused about, or ignorant of, their responsibilities.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m currently interviewing to fill an open position on my team. In asking candidates about why they are seeking a new position and how they like to be managed, I realized the old adage is still true &hellip;</p><p> <strong>  People quit their bosses, not jobs </strong></p><p> It is still in poor taste to talk poorly about your previous employer. And, when asked, all of the candidates answered appropriately. However, there were some really clear themes that came across in what they said.</p><p> Buckle up, buttercup! This is why your employees hate you &mdash; and why they&rsquo;re gonna quit as soon as a seemingly better opportunity comes along.</p><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t show interest in their development. </strong>  Employees want to work for someone who is going to help them learn and grow.</li><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t support their personal lives and need for time off. </strong>  Employees want to work for someone who understands, respects and encourage their life outside of work.</li><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t reward high performance. </strong>  Employees want to work for someone who is going to recognize and reward the top performers &mdash; even if they aren&rsquo;t a top performer.</li><li> <strong>  You can&rsquo;t do their job. </strong>  Employees want to work for someone who has done and, in a pinch, can do the work they perform every day. This ties into your ability to help them develop and grow &mdash; but it also relates to your ability to relate to their daily struggle and guide them in the best direction.</li><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t resolve conflict. </strong>  Employees want to work for someone who addresses problems head on and holds everyone accountable for results in their role. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  If your employees are leaving, chances you&rsquo;re failing in one or more of these areas &mdash; and your employees hate you. </strong></p><p> The good news is you can turn this trend around! Heading into the last days of this year and the start of a new year, it is a great time to create a plan to improve in these areas. Here are some tips you can use:</p><li> <strong>  Create personal development plans for your employees. </strong>  Meet with them one-on-one to find out what they&rsquo;re passionate about and help them set objectives to achieve their goals in a way that keeps them engaged and moves your organization forward.</li><li> <strong>  Walk the talk on flexible work scheduling.  </strong> Either change your policies and marketing materials surrounding flexible schedule and remote working to match your true expectations &mdash; or start letting your people take their time without infringing on it or laying the guilt trip.</li><li> <strong>  Recognize your top performers. </strong>  If budget allows, make sure you are appropriately compensating your best and brightest. If it doesn&rsquo;t allow, make sure you are praising and thanking them in public and private when warranted.</li><li> <strong>  Set a schedule for job shadowing and cross-training. </strong>  Make time and space in your calendar to refresh yourself on who and how the work gets done. Be prepared to shift duties and update processes as needed.</li><li> <strong>  De-throne the drama queens and kings. </strong>  Address the impact of personality conflicts on performance and morale head on &mdash; then set new ground rules for the future and hold everyone accountable.</li><p> <br/> These changes will not be easy &mdash; but they will be worth it. And in time, the hateration will stop and your employees will be showing you lots of love.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarilynECox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Marilyn Cox  </u> </a></p><p> My children love to argue. They like to argue with each other, and they especially love to argue if the purpose is to prove me wrong. And that&rsquo;s OK. I get it. They have a need for power and control and this is their way of exercising that.</p><p> Adults are really no different. We agree to disagree because we want to reject the objective reality of the situation and hopefully replace it with our own. I find this is especially true when I read about future trends. I approach trend material with a critical eye.</p><p> Is it because I&rsquo;m playing Devil&rsquo;s Advocate, or because I&rsquo;m a durge (think slang, not Star Wars)?</p><p> It&rsquo;s actually neither. I&rsquo;m critical, not because I entirely disagree with what&rsquo;s projected, but because I often fear the change that is to come.</p><p> So, in the spirit of a good discussion, debate, or what have you, a few friends and I decided to discuss a few of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://digiday.com/brands/digiday-list-whats-whats-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;What&rsquo;s In What&rsquo;s Out&rdquo; trends identified for 2015  </a>  \" </u> .</p><p> <strong>  TED Talks Are Out vs. Medium Post are In </strong></p><li> I don&rsquo;t believe TED Talks are out. TED Talks are like the Little Black Dress, they&rsquo;ll always be in style. I think what will change is the medium in which TED Talks are shared and recorded. I think we&rsquo;ll start to see a balance of audio with video. I also think they&rsquo;ll get shorter than the 15-20 minute presentation.</li><li> Well I had to look up Medium of course. Interesting, really nice, but I think the &ldquo;anybody contribute&rdquo; model could/will lead to a lot of noise that TED won&rsquo;t deal with. There is value in the expert curation. I don&rsquo;t want to wade through more of anything. I don&rsquo;t think Medium will ever get the penetration overall that TED talks have. I agree that they have to get shorter and more mobile friendly. I&rsquo;ve seen many that didn&rsquo;t benefit from visuals and might as well just be audio anyway.</li><li> Throwing my hat in the ring for TEDx. Those are definitely not going away. There are hundreds of new TedX events signing up to use the license per week. But they can definitely benefit from a podcast format, which is making resurgence as a platform. It&rsquo;s intriguing.</li><li> Does the fact that there are hundreds of TedX events dilute and detract from it? I used to subscribe to the video podcast but it was too much information and the files were too big. In any event, I don&rsquo;t see medium getting near the interest because anybody can do it. I&rsquo;ve always been big on podcasts. A best of TED podcast might be interesting. Maybe a channel that makes it easy to combine audio with graphics that look well done is needed. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  PR Pitches via email are out vs. PR pitches via Twitter are in </strong></p><li> I&rsquo;d have to see a Twitter PR pitch. I don&rsquo;t pitch so this one&rsquo;s hard to comment on. I can see Twitter as a platform to build a relationship, but I&rsquo;m not certain about pitching a story without a firmer foundation.</li><li> Not at all. Email pitches won&rsquo;t be replaced. You can touch base on Twitter, but you can&rsquo;t pitch a story &ndash; let alone a research-heavy story &ndash; on Twitter. I don&rsquo;t think that many journalists actually glean many stories from Twitter. It&rsquo;s a way to see trends and briefly talk to potential sources, but it&rsquo;s definitely not the replacement that everyone was claiming back in 2010. </li><li> Yeah I see only downsides comparing twitter to email and phone calls to pitch a real story. I could see junk being lobbed out on a twitter handle or # like a second rate newswire for anybody to pick up spam. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Lunch meetings are out vs. Breakfast meetings are in </strong></p><li> I&rsquo;d prefer a lunch meeting over a breakfast meeting. My new &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is at events if people (vendors and colleagues, not customers) want to meet then they can join me for a run or meet me in the gym. I don&rsquo;t like having &ldquo;those&rdquo; conversations over drinks and my other free time is for customers.</li><li> I see morning meetings picking up. I see more in our office doing it and I&rsquo;d rather do mornings. They don&rsquo;t seem to get bumped as much and I can always recover the workday from a late start, more so than mid afternoon. Lunch time seems busier with errands and things for a lot of people, if they actually eat lunch. </li><li> I host one breakfast meeting once a quarter for social communicators on campus. I take them to the best breakfast spot in town and it&rsquo;s always a great conversation. I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s a wonderful time to exert my authority as the central communications office because a breakfast meeting at a restaurant is a bit more formal than a lunch meeting since there are less people in the establishment. Aside from that, I hate morning meetings because I&rsquo;m so not a morning person. 9:15 am and beyond is good unless there&rsquo;s breakfast food involved. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Disrupting is out vs. Delighting is in </strong></p><li> This one I LOVE! I&rsquo;m burned out on the disruption message. I also like delighting because it places emphasis back on the customer and improving the customer experience. Less disrupting the market and more delighting the customer. Besides, customer delightment will ultimately lead to market disruption.</li><li> Agreed. I&rsquo;ve already begun incorporating this one into our marketing messaging. Disruption was never focused on the end user as far as I can tell. It was a way to focus on a product in a marketplace, but like you said, if we can delight a customer it won&rsquo;t matter how we&rsquo;re doing so and the disruption follows naturally.</li><li> We can hope that it this pans out. And hope that disruption takes &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; with it on the way out. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Agency Newsrooms are out vs. Agency Incubators are in </strong></p><li> Agencies often don&rsquo;t have a lot of &ldquo;news&rdquo; that they want to talk about, know how to talk about or are allowed to talk about. So most of their newsrooms suck, especially small and midsize groups. But they can&rsquo;t appear that they&rsquo;re doing nothing and want to prove how smart and creative they are. Instead of the newsroom with one entry a month, they make up a &ldquo;lab&rdquo; where they can put spec type work, or just general ideas that don&rsquo;t necessarily have dates attached to make it look like they&rsquo;re doing something. Ideally, they&rsquo;d create something that they can go sell to a market.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/razorfishs-atlanta-lab-focuses-store-digital-144497\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   It likely started with these guys  </a> </u>  and has  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.frogdesign.com/platforms/froglabs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   spread to places like this  </a> </u> . So I&rsquo;ll say that from a web navigation standpoint you&rsquo;ll see this pop up a lot in the future and probably less newsroom. But most will do it wrong or it won&rsquo;t be any better than their old newsroom. <br/>  </li><p> So what do you think? Do you agree or disagree? What other trends would you contest?</p>",

Scott Fitzgerald </strong></p><p> Advisors, experts&mdash;professionals of all stripes&mdash;debate (sometimes for years) whether to devote the time and emotional energy to write their first book.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s just cut to the chase.</p><p> If you can answer yes to BOTH these questions, you&rsquo;ve got something worth investing in:</p><p> <strong>  Do you have a core message worth sharing with an audience that matters to you? </strong></p><p> Can you position your book to deliver you revenue in some form&mdash;book sales, new clients, speaking fees, programs or maybe the right media attention&mdash;that will make it worth your while?</p><p> Truth: you don&rsquo;t have to sell a million&mdash;or even 10,000&mdash;copies to make your book a wildly successful business move.</p><p> The key&mdash;unless you&rsquo;re in a position to indulge in an expensive hobby&mdash;is to approach it strategically.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s your revenue model? </strong> Are you selling fee-for-service advice, training programs or perhaps accepting a piece of the pie, such as a percentage of your clients&rsquo; sales or assets?</p><p> Map out how this book will fit in your current and future revenue streams. Tip: Don&rsquo;t count on mega book sales if you don&rsquo;t already have an audience primed to buy you. Look instead at what happens if you only sell 1,000 copies. Or 500. Will the book bring you 1, 10, 100 new clients or customers? What is each one worth to you?</p><p> Take Jennifer, a financial advisor. A little digging showed us her average new client is worth $30,000 a year to her bottom line. She&rsquo;d have to sell 3,000 books at $10 apiece EVERY year to make what just one new client brings her. Looking strictly at book revenue, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that her time is best spent writing.</p><p> But. If she writes in a way that deeply resonates with her ideal clients and then markets and distributes her book strategically, all she needs is one new client to pay for her book-writing time. Ironically, that client may not even read the book, but be seduced by the theme, title or an interview with the author.</p><p> Then there was Harry, an expert who sold a few thousand books. But he didn&rsquo;t care about that revenue so much, because a few hundred readers bought his $1,500 training program. He parlayed a $10 book into a tidy half million bucks&mdash;and an audience panting for his next content.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not saying you SHOULD write that first book ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rochellemoulton.com/should-you-really-write-that-book/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more about that here  </a> </u> ), but isn&rsquo;t it worth some strategic thinking&mdash;and a little math&mdash;before you decide?</p><p> <strong>  TWEETABLE: </strong> You don&rsquo;t have to sell a million&mdash;or even 10,000&mdash;copies to make your book a wildly successful business move.</p><p> Like what you see here?

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Steph L Wagner </u></p><p> <strong>  My general rule to the newly single is to never make irreversible financial decisions during the first year after a divorce. </strong></p><p> But shortly after my own divorce was final, I put my house on the market and traded in my SUV for a more economical sedan.</p><p> It&rsquo;s funny how we often don&rsquo;t listen to our own advice.</p><p> But I knew as Chief Financial Officer of my newly formed &ldquo;empire,&rdquo; it was a wise move, both financially and emotionally. Not only did downsizing shave close to $2,000 off my monthly expenses (not to mention cutting my property taxes by one-third), but it also meant I had a clean slate to design the next chapter of my life.</p><p> My well-strategized plan quickly hit a glitch though.</p><p> About a week after I opened escrow on a new condo, a disturbing email popped in my inbox. It was from my lender and close friend. The subject line read, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with your credit score?&rdquo;</p><p> There is little that will create more anxiety to a finance guru than a blemished credit rating. In a panic, I grabbed the phone and began dialing for answers.</p><p> &ldquo;What in the hell do you mean I applied for and received a $50,000 line of credit?&rdquo;</p><p> Had my fear of falling victim to identity theft suddenly become a reality? The answer was yes. But the villain wasn&rsquo;t a well-organized gang or a brilliant computer hacker. The opportunist was actually my ex.</p><p> The man who once was my &ldquo;everything&rdquo; apparently decided that the best way to access an old, inactive line of credit &ndash; which had been previously titled in both of our names and I thought was closed &ndash; was to forge my John Hancock on the renewal form. As a result, I was now the proud owner of an additional $50,000 debt and a credit score that was more than 100 points lower than just six months before.</p><p> Ouch!</p><p> One of the most difficult things to adjust to in divorce is the notion that your once beloved partner is now, in most cases, your adversary. And just because the ink is dry on the divorce decree doesn&rsquo;t mean the battle is over. There is still work to be done. </p><p> Following are the six financial steps for the newly single: </p><p> <strong>  1. Finalize all financial arrangements.  </strong></p><p> Establishing the financial logistics of your divorce is only the first step. It is then your responsibility to see that the terms of your settlement are actually executed, including, but not limited to: changing the way financial accounts are titled, transferring divided assets into new accounts, executing any necessary quitclaim deed on properties and transferring title on personal property like cars, boats, RVS, etc. Also, remember to update your tax withholdings and notify your CPA about any material changes to your deductions. </p><p> Remember that if you have children, only one parent can claim them as dependents! </p><p> <strong>  2. Disinherit your ex.  </strong></p><p> Prepare a new will, trusts, living wills and/or medical directives and power of attorney.</p><p> (It&rsquo;s creepy to think that my ex had the ability to pull the plug!) Remember to also select new beneficiaries on all retirement accounts (IRAS, 401ks,etc.) as well as insurance policies.</p><p> Beneficiary designation trumps what you direct in your will! </p><p> <strong>  3. Check your credit report. </strong></p><p> Not only do you want to make certain there are no surprises, it is also important that you establish a list of liabilities that need to have your name or your ex&rsquo;s name removed from them per your divorce decree. Be vigilant! Don&rsquo;t assume that your ex has your back.</p><p> It is worth noting that if you own property together and both names are on the mortgage,</p><p> a quitclaim deed will NOT remove you from this obligation. Therefore, if the party who was awarded the house fails to make a payment, you are on the hook and your credit can be severely affected. To ensure that you are entirely off the loan, it&rsquo;s best to have the property sold or have it stipulated in the decree that the existing mortgage be refinanced by your ex within a specific period of time. </p><p> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t make irreversible financial decisions.  </strong></p><p> Although buying that convertible luxury vehicle, investing in a new venture or moving to Tuscany sound like great ways to begin a fresh start, you may be thinking emotionally and not strategically. Undoing a rash decision can cost you a lot of money down the road.</p><p> <strong>  5. Think strategically!  </strong></p><p> It is reasonable to assume you may need to purchase a big-ticket item like a new car (please, not that convertible) or downsize into a less expensive home. If so, be strategic about it. </p><p> You may actually have a better chance of securing these types of loans immediately after divorce while your tax returns from the prior years still reflect numbers from your prior, and, often times, more stable life. </p><p> If you simply need cash, don&rsquo;t rush to liquidate your retirement accounts! The cost is simply too high. Not only is there a penalty and tax consequences, you are sabotaging all the work your money has done to build your net worth. A better option may be to open a line of credit (home equity, personal, or business) where the terms are much more advantages than that of a credit card (4.86 percent vs. 15.57 percent APR.)</p><p> <strong>  6. Equip yourself with the right team. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Your new life deserves a strong footing and often surrounding yourself with a new CPA, trust attorney and financial advisor is essential. </strong> It is critical that all three share your values, ideals and possess a strong desire to work with you and the other members of your team to preserve your income, protect your assets and build your net worth. </p><p> Becoming a newly single is never easy, even under the best of circumstances. And while your ex may not intentionally try to sabotage you, there are essential steps you need to take to not only protect yourself, but also create a strong financial foundation for the next chapter of your life.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://christinetsai.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Chrstine Tsai  </u> </a>  </p><p> There are tons of productivity tips out there. <strong>  Here are my top 5. </strong></p><li> <strong>  Be present.  </strong> Multitasking is dangerous and causes you to feel frazzled because you&rsquo;re never fully concentrating on one thing. If you&rsquo;re on a phone meeting, don&rsquo;t plow through email or Facebook or Twitter. If you&rsquo;re in an in-person mtg, don&rsquo;t bring your laptop. Just bring yourself (and maybe a notebook) and actually listen to the other person. When you&rsquo;re spending time w/ your kids before they go to bed, actually play w/ them and engage yourself. Put your phone down. Email can wait. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Be on time. </strong>  I find that when I start to run late for meetings, my whole day feels frenetic and drains me of energy, leaving me less likely to actually GSD. When I actually do run on time, I feel energized because I know I wasn&rsquo;t wasting time. In-person mtgs often run late b/c you lose track of time, so I try to avoid this by setting up a calendar event immediately after my mtg (whether I actually have a mtg or not) and setting an alert to go off 5-10 min it&rsquo;s scheduled for. Then I know I need to skedaddle. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Be good to your body. </strong>  Folks in Silicon Valley work themselves to the bone like it&rsquo;s a badge of honor. But it&rsquo;s not possible to be running at full capacity for a long period of time. Otherwise you burn out. It is a marathon, not a sprint. Eat well, hydrate yourself, get exercise, and SLEEP. Such basic things are hard to do (I have a LOT of trouble w/ all 4 of these things). But when I am able to do them, I am able to get a lot more done. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Be responsive.  </strong> Everyone is guilty of dragging their feet in getting back to people - particularly over email.  <u>  Gokul Rajaram </u>  (who I worked with @ Google and has been a wonderful mentor) spoke to our accelerator batch yesterday and shared his tips for handling email. He quickly assesses incoming email. Anything he can handle in &lt;= 5 minutes, he tackles right then and there. Anything he deems will take much longer, he categorizes into a different label. He also mentioned how some people don&rsquo;t even use email, but only communicate via text. Whatever your method of choice is, being quick to respond usually helps productivity. You put the ball back in someone else&rsquo;s court and that&rsquo;s one less thing for you to do. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Be crisp. </strong>   <u>  Eric Antonow </u>  is one of the most sage people I know. I had the honor of working for him @ Google. He always reminded me to &ldquo;be crisp.&rdquo; In other words, be concise, be direct, and prune things down to the most salient points. I have found this to be true. This prevents you from wasting time due to beating around the bush, needing to clear up misunderstandings, etc. and ultimately makes you more efficient. (whether it&rsquo;s verbal or written communication)  <br/>  </li><p> What are your productivity tips?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Bruce Milne | <a href=\"http://socialware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Socialware  </u> </a></p><p> Looking for answers, suggestions and solutions online has quickly become the norm in the digital age. People place pizza delivery orders through apps rather than calling the store, and they order new phone and cable services through online accounts rather than customer service. Most consumers will do whatever they can to avoid being forced to have a conversation with a salesperson. Except when it comes to money matters.</p><p> A recent Wells Fargo/Gallup  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/174851/investors-opt-human-online-financial-advice.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Investor and Retirement Optimism Index  </a> </u>  survey conducted in July showed that even though U.S. adults spend almost  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Continues-Steal-Share-of-US-Adults-Daily-Time-Spent-with-Media/1010782\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   five and a half hours a day online  </a> </u> , investors still feel more comfortable working with a dedicated personal advisor than getting investment advice online from a financial website.</p><p> The survey was based on a national sample of U.S. investors with $10,000 or more in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or in a self-directed IRA or 401(k). People in this demographic are typically well versed in online activity, yet they continue to opt for a real human relationship to determine where to spend their money. Clearly, when it comes to money,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3288911/investors-registered-investment-advisers/when-choosing-a-financial-adviser-trust-trumps-all.html#.VBBk8vldWDx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trust wins  </a> </u> . Plugging your information into an online algorithm engine, which could very well be the same one used by your advisor, is all well and good, but people feel better having a human explain what it all means.</p><p> So investors want human advice, yet they spend a large portion of their day online. What does this mean for today&rsquo;s advisor? Some online channels can be a great way to build that trusted relationship that investors are seeking. It&rsquo;s not about the cold call or the hard sell. It&rsquo;s about warm introductions, getting to know your clients and sharing thoughtful information. An advisor can use social media to make the connection, but then nurture that connection in more traditional offline means. The two methods work hand-in-hand.</p><p> Social media networks, particularly LinkedIn, provide the perfect bridge between the online world and the human connection. Advisors can use these platforms to share quality content, engage with their audience and look for warm connections. The goal shouldn&rsquo;t be to use LinkedIn to connect with and subsequently scare off strangers. On the contrary, it&rsquo;s about establishing trust, educating your audience and building relationships so that clients feel good about choosing you as an advisor when the time is right for them. You never know how people might notice you when you start showing them the right mix of personality and quality content.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In addition to their products and services, I am a fan of Zendesk because they openly share pertinent customer experience information.  Unlike others who report customer experience results, Zendesk&rsquo;s data is not the byproduct of surveys but instead emerges from customer interactions with over 25,000 businesses in 140 countries.  Here are some high level findings from Zendesk&rsquo;s <u>  <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-benchmark\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Q2 report  </a> </u> :</p><p> When a customer contacts a business with a complaint, customer satisfaction decreases with the frequent use of the word &ldquo;sorry.&rdquo;  While sorry has it&rsquo;s place in resolving a customer&rsquo;s issue, frequent use of the word can signal that solutions are not being generated by the company&rsquo;s representative.</p><p> Closing off your communication with a customer is obviously an important transition point; particularly, after a service issue has been addressed.   According to the Zendesk report, &ldquo;When looking at the sign-off in the last public comment made by an agent to customer, it appears that specific word choices can impact customer satisfaction&hellip;The use of a valediction&mdash;specifically &lsquo;Yours sincerely, &lsquo;Best regards,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cheers&rsquo;&mdash;are all better options than other choices, or none at all. Customers want personalization, and a personalized sign-off can be a great reminder to the customer that they are speaking with a human. However, and perhaps oddly, customers appear to have an aversion to the phrase &lsquo;Best wishes.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s difficult to draw any conclusive lessons from this. But it is clear that small details like this can have a serious impact. Tracking these details and learning from them&mdash;in this case, avoiding 'Best wishes'&mdash;is more important than you might realize.&rdquo;</p><p> How often are you or your company&rsquo;s representative saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; to a customer?  Customers want you to acknowledge the problem and fix it and not repeatedly apologize for the problems existence.</p><p> In the spirit of the Zendesk study, I take my leave this week by simply saying &ldquo;with gratitude and enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>",

    "link": "four-potential-holes-in-your-eo-coverage",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Navigating the nooks and crannies of errors and omissions insurance can be exhausting. Many advisors buy whatever policy seems simplest to understand and figure they're protected. But mere coverage is not sufficient to avoid liability, and wealth managers should check the language of each policy for gaps that may expose them to legal risks. Below are four issues that insurance brokers often overlook when explaining coverage and premium options to advisors.</p><p> <strong>  Policy may not cover regulatory investigations. </strong> Insurers often say a policy will cover legal costs associated with a formal regulatory investigation. However, in many cases, the policy language makes no mention of expenses stemming from such probes. Also, some policies will cover them only if the investigation was initiated by a client complaint &mdash; creating a hurdle that sometimes can't be overcome. For example, what if the SEC, during a routine inspection, stumbles upon something that leads to a formal investigation? Or what if the firm is involved in an event governed by the Whistleblower Protection Act, in which the complainant is an employee, not an investor? Overall, the best approach is to obtain coverage for regulatory investigations and litigation that is not restricted to client complaints.</p><p> <strong>  Policy may not cover broad corporate errors. </strong> Senior executives may believe they are covered because their job title is included in the definition of insured individuals. However, E&amp;O policies are typically triggered only by a written demand from a client, whereas a chief compliance officer may be dealing with an issue that stems from a broad operations breakdown. Therefore, issues involving the CCO may not be covered. As a solution, advisors should purchase directors and officers (D&amp;O) liability insurance designed to protect executives against claims arising out of business decisions rather than investment decisions. Again, make sure the policy doesn't exclude regulatory investigations.</p><p> <strong>  Policies may not cover trading errors. </strong> Advisors may think their policy automatically covers trading errors, but most do not. Firms need to add coverage for such errors. Further, advisors should be familiar with policy provisions stipulating when and how the trading error must be reported to the carrier and whether the policy provides for reimbursement. It's worth remembering that most trading errors are discovered by the financial advisor or custodian before the client learns about them.</p><p> <strong>  Carrier may not defend the advisor. </strong> Advisors quite often feel their insurer would rather settle a claim to keep its own expense down than fight to protect the advice firm's reputation. Advisors should check for \"duty to defend\" language in the policy that spells out the carrier's obligations to provide a proper legal defense. \"Duty to defend\" language can be inconsistent, so insurance brokers should make advisors aware of any gaps, based on the brokers' experience with individual carriers.</p><p> Another important issue here is the settlement clause, also known as the \"hammer clause.\" It states that the insurer's obligation ends at the amount for which they can settle with the plaintiff or at the policy's given limit of liability. The clause also says if the advisor fails to consent, any expenses incurred above the suggested settlement amount are the advisor's own responsibility. The remedy is to remove the hammer clause from the policy or come up with a predetermined negotiated compromise with the carrier prior to securing coverage. Importantly, advisors should confirm that they can select the attorney who will defend them. Typically, there will be increased pressure to settle if the carrier appoints the defense.</p><p> The more familiarity advisors have with these themes, the better positioned they will be to identify weaknesses in their E&amp;O coverage. Such due diligence is a crucial task for advisors serious about navigating legal risk and gaining peace of mind about their firm's future.</p>",

    "link": "advisors-the-keys-to-an-effective-strategic-planning-meeting",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> What does the new year hold in store for you? This is a popular time for advisory firms to lay out plans for the next 12 months. Unfortunately, many strategy sessions end up being much less productive than they could be, producing a document that no one will look at for another year and failing to create any real change or progress in an organization. I am just wrapping up the current season of helping advisors conduct their strategic planning meetings or exercises. So, while it is fresh in my mind, I wanted to share a few of the keys to having an effective strategic planning meeting. Whether yours is done at a regularly scheduled management meeting, as an extended lunch, or as a full day off-site, here are a few tips to make the exercise productive.</p><p> <strong>  Review last year&rsquo;s goals </strong> &ndash; looking back at the plans you made last year and what you accomplished based makes your planning exercise a learning experience. Make yours straightforward, nonjudgmental, and brief. Simply list each goal you developed in last year&rsquo;s meeting, indicate whether you accomplished it or not (or if there is no way to know, which is itself an important learning opportunity), what you learned in attempting to achieve them, and what the person responsible for the goal could have done better. The president or leader should go first in sharing what they could have done better to set the tone for the rest of the group. No blaming or finger-pointing. A dispassionate evaluation of how the organization did will help you develop better goals this year.</p><p> <strong>  Focus on your audacious long-term goal </strong> &ndash; what do you want the organization to look like in 10 to 20 years? Describe it in as much detail as possible. Make it quantitative. I have seen strategic plans whose long-term objective read something like &ldquo;to be a respected fiduciary firm.&rdquo; How do you know if you have succeeded? More important, it is not something that will get people excited. It is certainly not audacious. &ldquo;We will be the largest financial planning firm in Miami&rdquo; is better. &ldquo;We provide comprehensive financial planning services to more high net worth households in Seattle than any other firm&rdquo; or &ldquo;we are in the top 50 of Financial Planning magazine&rsquo;s top RIA firms&rdquo; is better yet.</p><p> <strong>  Develop short-term goals </strong> &ndash; I am a fan of Verne Harnish and his Mastering the Rockefeller Habitsand, to oversimplify some of what he has to say, you will want to know where you ultimately want to be and what the next step is. Developing one, three, and five year plans is futile. The environment is moving too fast and too much can happen in the next year to make detailed intermediate to long-term plans worthwhile. But knowing your goal in as much detail as possible and knowing what you need to do to take the next step in that direction makes for good strategic management. So once you have your detailed long-term goal develop a 90 day plan. One year goals can be helpful but what you want to accomplish in the next quarter is more important.</p><p> <strong>  Be careful about brainstorming </strong> &ndash; brainstorming ideas can work but only if done properly. And most planning meetings are not conducted properly. &ldquo;Properly&rdquo; includes many guidelines included in the 1953 book that popularized the idea that are frequently ignored, including having the right group size, focusing on idea generation without evaluation, using it as a supplement to individual idea generation, and using a facilitator to enforce the rules. The way brainstorming works in many organizations is a conversation dominated by the loudest or highest-ranking participant generating a few ideas and then systematically tearing them all down. There are several variations that can help make it more productive. One of my favorite exercises is to have group members write as many ideas as they can come up with on Post-it notes and then group them on a wall or a whiteboard into general categories. Another is to solicit as many ideas as possible and then have group members allocate a limited number of &ldquo;votes&rdquo; (usually colored stick-on dots) for the ones they want to explore in more detail. The top half dozen or so get further in-depth discussion.</p><p> <strong>  Be reasonable about what you can expect to accomplish </strong> &ndash; avoid going overboard on the number of project you undertake. Three initiatives is probably about as much as an organization can hope to devote attention and resources to at any one time. If you can comfortably manage significantly more than that, your initiatives are too small.</p><p> <strong>  Dig deep </strong> &ndash; many strategic planning exercises fail because ideas are not developed. The group generates lots of lists on flip charts which get transcribed and distributed to the group that are then ignored. They lack concrete plans. Come up with all of those lists of ideas and then focus on the top 3 to 5. Distill, distill, distill. Split into smaller groups to develop projects around those goals. What would success look like? What would be involved in accomplishing them?</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Red team&rdquo; your plans </strong> &ndash; the military is famous for developing exercises to simulate campaigns. Groups are divided into teams to compete with each other. The &ldquo;red&rdquo; team is always the bad guy. Even when evaluating projects, they &ldquo;red team&rdquo; their plans. A working group presents a strategy or plan. Another working group, the red team, has the responsibility of finding the flaws and weaknesses and cutting the plan to shreds. The group who is presenting the plan takes that feedback and updates the plan to address the flaws and weaknesses. The presenting group is not allowed to rebut or argue during the red team exercise. The red team criticizes but does not insult and their comments are taken as valuable feedback. Try this exercise and your plans will be a lot more achievable. By the way, the red team are not the enemy in real life. After the exercise, they will be as responsible for seeing the plans through to success as the team who developed them.</p><p> <strong>  Make sure each objective has a DRI </strong> &ndash; Apple is famous for making sure that every initiative has a particular individual whose job it is to see it through. They even have language for it: a DRI, or directly responsible individual. You could hear the term thrown around in management meetings. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the DRI on that?&rdquo; Before you conclude your planning exercise make sure that each objective has a particular person who is accountable for it and must report back to the group periodically on its progress.</p><p> What have you found that makes your strategic planning exercise effective? What things have you done in your planning meetings that created the biggest results? Share with us your recommendations!</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I&rsquo;m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that&rsquo;s the great puzzle!&rdquo; &mdash; Lewis Carroll</p><p> The Internet. It&rsquo;s an amazing &ldquo;place&rdquo;. An amazing tool. An amazing platform. When you think of the changes its brought into our lives, it really does give one pause. Think about it.</p><p> It&rsquo;s an amazing &ldquo;place.&rdquo; Twenty years ago there were about 600 web pages, now there&rsquo;s over 600 million. Curious about something? Jump on the web. Where to eat? The definition of &ldquo;oeuvre&rdquo;? Symptoms of meningitis? Henry Ford&rsquo;s birthplace? Jump on the web.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also an amazing tool. Publish your own thoughts to a worldwide audience? Raise money for a startup product? Write code and see its effect immediately? Create beautiful designs? The web is a first class citizen in your toolbox to do these and many more amazing things.</p><p> But perhaps the aspect of the Internet that holds the most promise is that it&rsquo;s an amazing platform. It&rsquo;s the international public channel for publishing access (APIs) to the data and functionality of  your choice. How did Facebook make the leap past MySpace? They published an API and opened their functionality and reach and capabilities to outside developers. And you can say the same of Twitter, LinkedIn and a myriad of other prominent companies.</p><p> The best example of using the Internet as a platform is a mobile app. It depends on APIs to function and it transforms the way we live. Literally. Not having apps available is like not having a car or a television. It&rsquo;s a very unlikely scenario and most people depend on them for their routine and daily rhythm. Trade stocks, check into your flight, connect with social media, use as a GPS; we all love apps.</p><p> But you know all that. Here&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s missing: YOU. There&rsquo;s no API for you. Think of the data that you emit every day:</p><li> Health: heart, respiration, weight, sleep patterns, steps</li><li> Location: routes, speed, safety, outdoor, indoor</li><li> Shopping: purchases, views, returns</li><li> Social: FaceBook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest</li><li> Entertainment: media, television, radio, blogs, reading, web</li><li> Photos: who, what, where</li><li> Position: just exactly what route did you take through that store?</li><li> Home: temperature, lights, appliances, water, electricity</li><li> Automobiles: acceleration, braking, routes, systems, oil, fuel</li><li> Communication: phone, texts, email</li><li> Attention: what are you looking at, are you being effective, efficient</li><p> And who owns all of that data? You do. It&rsquo;s as much yours as your fingerprints are, as your thoughts are. It is in many ways simply a reflection of your identity. It&rsquo;s who you are. But what is happening to this most valuable of assets? We treat most of this data like exhaust. We just emit it and it escapes into thin air, not collected, not seen, not valued, not utilized. Truth be told, some of it is collected and used by the various firms we interact with on the Internet. But our consent to use it is in many ways granted implicitly and we&rsquo;re really not aware of what&rsquo;s being collected, how it&rsquo;s being utilized and really what its fair value is.</p><p> How would the world be different if you controlled your own data? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if there was an API of You, of all of your own data? What if there was a way that anyone who wanted your data would have to ask you, would have to connect to your API? Right now it&rsquo;s a mass of hundreds of companies in a free for all, grabbing all of your stuff. What if your personal data was brokered through an API? What if that data was currency that you could use in trade with firms for their services?</p><p> Some of this makes obvious sense. You could grant your doctor (and his staff/systems) access to your bodily stats so that real-time monitoring of your health data was always occurring. Systems like this could over time understand your behavior patterns and anticipate health incidents that might arise ahead of time giving you warning to change your behavior and avoid those problems.</p><p> You could grant specific retailers access to various bits of information about you so that they could push a variety of offers to you that anticipate what you might appreciate. Chances are, if that retailer uses this information well you&rsquo;ll be a happy customer and appreciate the partnership. And if not, you&rsquo;ll shut off your API to them.</p><p> The possibilities seem endless:</p><li> Your auto insurance could recognize safe driving behaviors and price premiums accordingly as well as coach you on better practices</li><li> Your GPS provider could learn your driving patterns and help you with route management and safer, faster trips</li><li> Your home automation provider could help you manage utilities and indoor amenities</li><li> Parents could have access to children&rsquo;s behaviors keeping them safe and caring for them</li><li> Grocers could keep the house stocked, perhaps providing suggested lists of items to be delivered</li><li> Your fitness club could track your progress providing you with updated stats to motivate you</li><li> And the list goes on&hellip;</li><p> Think of a massive switchboard with feeds of your data entering into the switchboard and outputs of your data coming out of the switchboard. You provide the feeds going into the switchboard. You control the outputs coming out of the switchboard. Your feeds are the results of your actions including the data from all of your devices, your mobile phone, your car, your bodily implants, your home, your appliances, your Internet trail, your tweets, your posts, whatever you choose. Your outputs are the APIs, the sets, categories, and packages of data that you choose to publish.</p><p> What&rsquo;s missing is the company that manages this switchboard. Think of this company as your agent (in fact, let&rsquo;s call it Agent).</p><p> Agent has access to all of the data that you choose to provide it; health, location, attention, etc. Agent then allows you to organize your data in whatever ways make sense to you and make that data available as an API. There could be standardized sets of APIs around health or attention or finances. Additionally there would be custom APIs where you pick and choose the data you care to make public. But the key is, all of this would be completely in your control.</p><p> Of course there would be concerns around the wisdom of providing this level of information to any one firm. Once that data is stored, could it be stolen (yes) or could it be used for nefarious purposes (yes)? That said, your information is already online. Would the existence of Agent provide you with greater security and control over this data? And would the benefits outweigh the risks? Perhaps.</p><p> Maybe the biggest benefit of all would be the integration of this data across multiple facets of your life. Would your health monitor be able to alert your GPS or your vehicle on an emerging condition relevant to your ability to drive? Would you be able to use your data as currency to reduce costs with firms? Instead of your data being harvested unbeknownst to you and being used injudiciously, would control of that data distribution provide improved security and comfort and reward?</p><p> The questions are many and the possibilities incredible. Maybe the next Google will be Agent, the company that brokers your data for you, the company that transforms the Internet into &ldquo;The Internet of You.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Not every moment spent traveling over the holidays is awful&hellip;just most of them. There&rsquo;s no denying that any role that deals directly with the public holds challenges and jobs at the airport, particularly during the crush of the holiday season, are the poster child for this kind of reality show. I think that many of us who travel can count on one hand the number of times we&rsquo;ve seen an airport employee smile.</p><p> Last week as I was beginning a long journey home to San Francisco, I arrived at the Richmond, Virginia airport for the first of two flights. I was stressed out and tired when I walked up to the gate area looking a lot like Grumpy Cat. I just wanted to get onboard and start the trip home.</p><p> As I was waiting for the call to board, a smiling Delta worker named Angela picked up the microphone and announced to all of us that we were now in her house and she makes the rules. All our ears perked up as she proceeded to tell us the rules.</p><li> When she says hi, you say hi (and 60+ people in loud voice did indeed say hi back to her).</li><li> She told us we are going to board in the zones listed on our boarding passes and if we attempted to get in line before our scheduled group, she would publicly embarrass us and send us to the back of the line.</li><li> If we had more than the allowed two small pieces of hand luggage, she would pick the one she liked best and take it from us and thoroughly enjoy all the contents. <br/>  </li><p> We all laughed when she was done. As my zone was called and I made my way up to the front of the line, I handed Angela my boarding pass and said to her, &ldquo;Thank you for loving your job so much.&rdquo; She turned to me and said, &ldquo;You bet I do, can&rsquo;t wait to get here everyday.&rdquo;</p><p> As I sat in my seat waiting to take off I laughed to myself and thought well she just schooled me on what engagement is all about. So, here are my six lessons on engagement as taught to me by Angela, the gate agent.</p><li> Every job, no matter what it may be, is something you can be proud of and passionate about.</li><li> We all need to take ownership for our job, make it our own and be free to bring personality to the workplace.</li><li> Take pride in what you do, no matter how menial a task you might be asked to do.</li><li> It takes more effort to frown than smile, so why waste extra energy.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t wait for permission to have fun at work, just do it. It is contagious.</li><li> We are all CEO&rsquo;s (Chief Engagement Officers) and we don&rsquo;t need to rely on others to engage us. <br/>  </li><p> I&rsquo;m so glad I took the time to thank Angela for her engagement. We all need to reinforce this kind of behavior so more of it occurs. Angela&rsquo;s passion for her work led me to have a much better customer experience than I usually have when flying, particularly during the holidays.</p><p> This engaging experience didn&rsquo;t make the travel shorter, it was still a 10-hour trip by the time I made it home, but at least my smile stayed with me for the entire journey!</p>",

    "content": "<p> The story he shared in a recent workshop I led stopped my heart. We were talking about leadership and &ldquo;bringing out the best in people,&rdquo; when John (obviously not his real name) confided, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone do what you&rsquo;re talking about better than my wife.&rdquo;</p><p> We smiled. &ldquo;No. You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he continued.  (His eyes got bigger and his posture took on a sincerity that made everyone in the room lean in.) No one expected what came next.</p><p> &ldquo;I was an absolute asshole. If you were to look up bad husbands in Wikipedia my picture would be there.&rdquo;</p><p> I stayed totally still. There was absolutely nothing I could say next that would trump his story.</p><p> &ldquo;I had been such a jerk for so many months. I knew it. She knew it. I was deeply depressed, and not myself. She didn&rsquo;t complain. She never seemed to take it personally. Although, I can&rsquo;t imagine how she wouldn&rsquo;t. We had no money, which made the whole situation even more grim.</p><p> Then one day after a lot of long ones, she asked:  &ldquo;Would you be willing to fully trust me and get up at 3am with me tomorrow and follow me?&rdquo;</p><p> I felt so guilty, I said &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Even though I found the mere thought exhausting.</p><p> She woke me up, blind-folded me and took me sky diving&ndash;my top bucket-list adventure. We both knew we couldn&rsquo;t afford it. But I leaped in. She took pictures and videos. As she played them back, she reminded me, &ldquo;This is the man I love. This is who you really are. You can be this. You will get there again. I love you.&rdquo;</p><p> Amen.</p><p> I&rsquo;m going to admit right now, I&rsquo;m not that big of a wife. This would NEVER have occurred to me. I&rsquo;m in awe of this woman I&rsquo;ve never met, inspiring a man with enormous potential to be bigger. As he shared his story, his eyes sparkled as they had for the previous two days. He was a ball of vibrant energy and potential. I&rsquo;d feel lucky to have him on any team I was leading.</p><p> Perhaps someone you&rsquo;re leading right now could use such a generous, humble and confident approach. A second chance to be seen for what&rsquo;s possible.</p><p> P.S. I would love to schedule a free consultation about how I can help your team achieve breakthrough results in 2015.

    "content": "<p> Did you know that feeling isolated is worse for your health than smoking cigarettes? I remember when I first read the study years ago as I was doing research for The Sharp Solution. I immediately recognized the need to add social connections to my list of fundamental brain boosting strategies, not just in the book but also in my own life. I had been doing a pretty good job of staying on top of my nutrition, fitness, sleep and relaxation practices&hellip;or at least I knew what I should be doing if I wasn&rsquo;t quite there yet. But I had never considered how loneliness could affect the brain and body.</p><p> It turns out that perceiving a lack of social support is one of the primary triggers for our built in stress response. Think about it: if something goes wrong and we&rsquo;re all alone that&rsquo;s a serious problem. Although it might not be top of mind, our primitive brain recognizes the need for community and support much more than our analytical brain wants to give credit.</p><p> Knowing this doesn&rsquo;t make it easier though. In fact, I often feel like ignorance would be bliss because it would allow me to just cruise through the day without feeling such emptiness when it comes to my lack of meaningful connection. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m actually alone. I spend the majority of time surrounded by people on planes, in cars, at hotels and conferences. But I&rsquo;ve learned that being alone and feeling lonely are two very different things. I&rsquo;ve been speaking to thousands of people and felt totally alone, and at the same time I&rsquo;ve been alone and felt completely connected to the world around me.</p><p> I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is there are two ways we can work on deepening our sense of connection. First, by making social support a priority. Not easy for a perfectionistic introvert to do, considering the fact that the worse I feel the less I want to be around people, even though this is typically when I need support the most. Second, by working on ways to feel more connected to the world around us as a whole. For me this comes through spiritual practices such as loving kindness meditation and prayer.</p><p> In a world that is so overly connected with technology, it&rsquo;s easy to feel busy and alone. Our current work environment also enables us to work more and more from home or on the road, which is great for providing flexibility but also challenging in how isolating it can become. So as I think about ways to build a better brain through personal connection, I&rsquo;m committed to reaching out more often to those in my &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;, being more careful about spending excess time with &ldquo;energy vampires&rdquo;, and continuing my spiritual practices each morning that help shift my brain into a more open state of love, rather than fear. I&rsquo;m also going to re-read one of my favorite books,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Love-2-0-Creating-Happiness-Connection/dp/0142180475\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Love 2.0  </a> </u>  by Dr. Barbara Fredrickson, which talks about how we can more regularly experience loving moments with the people around us.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It's always interesting to hear about people talk about their home. Many view it as primarily as an asset, an investment.</p><p> I tend to side with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/think-of-your-home-as-a-place-to-live-not-an-investment-2014-12-30\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jonathan Clements who recommends on this site  </a> </u>  that you should consider a home strictly as the place that you live, and not primarily as an investment asset. Of course, it can be an asset when considering where your funds for retirement will come from. However, you still need a place to live and selling one home for another is only of value to your retirement if you sell high, buy low and are fully aware of the expenses associated with relocation.</p><p> Of course, with the current interest in reverse mortgages, this also adds an interesting aspect to the use of your house as a retirement funding asset.</p><p> Many people who decide to stay in their existing home or relocate to a \"smaller\" house recognize that ultimately it is primarily a place to live and the ultimate recipient of the home \"asset\" will be the children upon inheritance of their estate.</p><p> Coming up with a practical and realistic solution to passing your house to your children as the beneficiaries of your will can be tricky, especially when the children grew up in the house. The first step, like with so many aspects of planning for later life and beyond, is to have clear and definitive discussions with family members. Having ' <u>  the Talk </u> ' is vital, especially when the family home is involved!</p><p> As Ric Runestad, owner of Runstad Financial Services, advises his clients who are considering where their house will go when they pass away, \"In order to prevent any kind of conflict between your children, it's important to have the conversation, set expectations and create a plan of action.\"</p><p> Mr. Runestad points out the recent realities of having more retirees taking in their adult children and grandchildren lead to situations where the owner of the home becomes accustomed to having the children live with them and then simply deciding to just give them the house. \"If this scenario isn't discussed with all of the children, it can create serious issues in the family dynamics and the issue may never heal,\" Runestad says.</p><p> As someone who can personally attest to this exact situation occurring to me, I agree fully with Mr. Runstad. However, this wasn't an issue to any family members because our family did have 'the Talk' and this situation was clarified and discussed early and it created no family problems. Not having those discussions early and laying out the arrangement with all family members will cause issues that can often break families apart.</p><p> Mr. Runstad also points out that besides the emotional aspects of passing on a home are the tax benefits that may be received by his clients. \"Your heirs are automatically entitled to a step up in cost basis. What this means is if you bought the house at $200,000, but at the time of death, the fair market value is $800,000, the beneficiaries would pay no federal capital gains tax if the house sold at this market value,\" Runstad points out.</p><p> Whether it's concerns about taxation, setting up trusts, or arrangements to protect children already living in a home, it's important for families to get together and clearly discuss whatever arrangement the homeowner decides upon to ensure that all family members are on the same page.</p><p> <strong>  As I say, having 'the Talk' brings families together so that they stay together. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://alexpirouz.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alex Pirouz  </a> </u></p><p> In dealing with many business owners over the years I have come to realise there are certain things that limit a business owner&rsquo;s ability to succeed. From this list, there is one in particular that stands out: mindset.</p><p> Successful people will often tell you that to be successful in business, 80 per cent of it comes down to psychology and 20 percent skill/strategy. You can&rsquo;t reach success if you have one but not the other.</p><p> It is common to pick up a magazine or newspaper and see a success story of someone who experienced a lot of obstacles and challenges before becoming successful as a business owner, musician, athlete or celebrity.</p><p> In fact, if you study some of the most successful people in the world you will realise that most had to endure hardship and hurdles before reaching success. I myself failed in my first four businesses and lost half a million dollars before achieving success in my fifth business four years later.</p><p> The point is you can have all the skills, knowledge and expertise in your field but if you don&rsquo;t have the right mindset to pull it all together, chances are you will not be successful in business.</p><p> Over the years, I have had the privilege of spending time with some of the most successful athletes, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and celebrities. While they all reached success in many different ways, they have the following four attitude traits in common:</p><p> <strong>  1. Passion </strong> <br/> If you look at the word passion and break it down, it means: Pass. I. On. Don&rsquo;t go into business just for the sake of making money; be passionate about the industry. Too many times I see business owners enter a market simply because of social proof.</p><p> They see or read stories of others who have been successful and think: well if they can do it so can I; there must be huge potential in that sector. But when the going gets tough and they start to incur more and more challenges within the business, suddenly they start focusing on other ideas or projects.</p><p> This leads me into the next point&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  2. Focus </strong> <br/> Follow One Course Until Successful. Successful people focus on one thing until that job, business or project is completed. They are not dabblers! As they become more successful and earn more money, they start to hire and delegate certain roles to team members to enable them to grow their portfolio.</p><p> Building a successful business takes time, it is not something you can start today and expect huge returns within the next day, week or even months. With competition fiercer then ever before, the effects of globalisation, the internet and information age, we need to realise that in order to be successful we must have a long-term view and vision when looking to build a business.</p><p> <strong>  3. Values </strong> <br/> Values are traits or qualities that are considered important and desirable. They represent your highest priorities and deeply held driving forces that influence your actions and reactions on a daily basis.</p><p> Because your values represent what is most important to you, they are not something you want or wished you could have. They are traits you need everyday to make decisions and move forward. Values are your convictions, ethics and beliefs in one.</p><p> All successful people ensure their vision and mission meet their highest values in life to ensure they are not in conflict. People who don&rsquo;t know their values tend to wander around, hopping from one thing to another trying to find themselves.</p><p> What you value may be totally different to someone else, there is no right or wrong. For example: my top two values in business are passion and education. I love education on topics that I am passionate about.</p><p> <strong>  4. Strengths and weaknesses </strong> <br/> I see so many entrepreneurs in business wearing too many different hats. They are wearing the marketing hat along with the sales hat, customer service hat, social media hat and just about any other hat you can think of.</p><p> This may be fine for a start-up business with very little funding or working capital. But for those entrepreneurs who have passed start-up stage and are looking to build a scalable company, the only real way you can to that is to identify key individual strengths and weaknesses and build a team that is complimentary to those traits.</p><p> Doing this will ensure you are able to focus on the things you&rsquo;re good at and outsource/delegate weaknesses to those who excel in that area and have a natural love for it.</p>",

    "content": "Recently, I lead a workshop in Seattle for a group of very experienced advisors with one of the largest firms on the street. The program focused on creating new business opportunities.  Shortly after the workshop I received the following email from one of the Financial Advisors.<br/><br/>\"I quite often built friendships at my athletic club with very successful people.  I never know how to ask them for a \"meeting\" and take it from a personal relationship to potentially a business relationship as well.  Anything that you could suggest that I say to be able to \"ask\" for a meeting with them?\"  T.<br/><br/>Here is the email I sent back to him with my suggestions.  Let me know what you think.<br/> <p> Dear T. <br/> Thanks for the question, I suggest you try one of these two approaches. First, here is a way to ask for an appointment, particularly if this is someone that is a relatively new acquaintance.  <br/> <br/> &ldquo;You know Bob, I have really enjoyed the opportunity to meet you socially through the club and was hoping that I could have the opportunity to introduce you to myself professionally.  Maybe we could meet at Starbucks for a cup of coffee one morning this week, and I could share with you a little about what I do in my role at UBS.  I think it would take about fifteen minutes and from there we could both decide whether it makes sense to continue talking along those lines.   Would that be ok with you?  What morning works best?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Another approach you may try, and this might work better with a more established relationship, is to start with an email and follow up with a phone call.  The email could simply read like this:  </p><p> &ldquo;Bob, I am reaching out to people I know who either should be clients of mine or they know people who should.  I&rsquo;ld like to buy you lunch this week and I think by the end of lunch we will know which camp you fall into.  I&rsquo;ll call you later this morning to check your schedule.&rdquo;   </p><p> Then call and ask for the lunch appointment. <br/> <br/> In both instances when you get the face time I suggest the following 4 Point Agenda: <br/> <br/> <strong>  First, position the conversation as exploratory. </strong>  Frame the discussion around these two points: One &ndash;  &ldquo;I want to share a little about my role at UBS and how I help other people like you&rdquo;.  Two &ndash; &ldquo;Since my focus is on helping other folks like you, I would love any insights that you may have from the &ldquo;client&rdquo; perspective that could help me in my practice&rdquo;.    Set the expectation that at by the end of the conversation you will probably both have a better feeling of whether it makes sense to take the discussion further.  Then gain permission to proceed, &ldquo;Is that ok?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> <strong>  Second, be prepared with a concise and solid &ldquo;Branding Message&rdquo;. </strong>  Be conversational but confident.  Describe the profile of the client you can help the most.  (It might/should sound like them.)  Describe what you do, how you do it, the resources available to you, and the service aspects of your practice that you feel differentiate you and your team (communication!!!).   <br/> <br/> <strong>  Third, probe to understand how they currently have their financial resources/services organized and why they think that is the best way to do it. </strong>  Be careful how you approach this.  Don&rsquo;t assume that they have problems.  Approach it as though you don&rsquo;t expect them to have any problems.  The implied assumption is that &ldquo;you are smart, you probably have a good handle on everything, in fact your insights could be very helpful to me as I make decisions about how to shape and run my practice&rdquo;.  Ask permission to ask them about the firms they currently work with and their experiences with financial service providers both past and present.  &ldquo;Would it be ok if I asked you a little about how you have things organized and why?&rdquo;  Ask questions about each of the relationships they have with financial institutions/advisors/etc..  Think in terms of PAST, PRESENT, and FUTURE. <br/> <br/> Here are some example: <br/> <br/> <strong>  PAST </strong> - &ldquo;How did you get started with them?  Who introduced you? What attracted you to them? Where you considering other alternatives at the time? What were your criteria for selection?  What pushed them over the top? If you were to go through that selection process again, what would you do differently?  Who else have you worked with in the past that you no longer work with?  What caused you to move from that arrangement?\" <br/> <br/> <strong>  PRESENT </strong> &ndash; &ldquo;What do you like best about how you have things currently organized?  What do you like least?  If you could change something what would that be?  What kind of client satisfaction score did you give them the last time they asked?  If they asked today what you say on scale of 1 to 10?  What do they need to do to be a ten? How do you pull this all together into one plan?  Is there one overarching plan in place?  Would that be important to you?  Would it make a difference in how you made decisions, or felt about your decisions if there was one plan that integrated all these pieces?&rdquo; <br/> <br/> <strong>  FUTURE </strong> &ndash; &ldquo;What would you like to see changed with regard to the financial products and services you use?  If you were in charge, how would it work?  What would cause you to move any of these relationships? Do you see anything like that on the horizon?\" <br/> <br/> <strong>  Fourth, you will need to set the next step based upon what you hear. </strong>  There are at least four potential outcomes.  One, you got a &ldquo;qualified prospect&rdquo;, that is someone who is dissatisfied with their current arrangement and willing to explore further with you.  Two, you got a &ldquo;prospect&rdquo;, that is someone who is not yet dissatisfied with their current situation but you can see (or suspect) that they should be dissatisfied based upon what you heard.   Three, you got a &ldquo;long term prospect&rdquo; someone who actually has a good handle on things.  And based on what you have heard it would be near impossible to unseat the current advisor unless something changed dramatically.  (They are probably dealing with an Advisor who is a Cannon disciple.)  Four, you got a &ldquo;non-prospect&rdquo;, someone who just doesn&rsquo;t qualify for your practice. <br/> <br/> So, let&rsquo;s look at each of these.</p><li> <strong>  Qualified Prospect </strong> &ndash; Go back to the points in your branding message and &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; or connect those to the points of dissatisfaction that they expressed.  Connect the next step to your planning process and set the appropriate expectation for what you will do, what the outcome will be and the time and information required from them.  Then close for the next appointment.</li><li> <strong>  Prospect </strong> &ndash; Go back to the points in you branding message that differentiate you from the providers they currently work with.  Suggest to them that a deeper discussion around the details of what they are doing would be beneficial.  You can successfully position this around a &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; conversation.  This works really well when you discover that the prospect has their assets spread across multiple firms.  In that case you can describe how that often leads to greater risk because of three &ldquo;risk factors&rdquo; that are inherent in the multiple advisor approach.  First, often with multiple advisors there is not one overall asset allocation strategy.  So people often end up with an asset allocation strategy that is in appropriate for them.  Second, in the multiple advisor scenarios it is extremely difficult to manage an overall asset allocation.  It is difficult to know when you are out of range of the asset allocation targets and it is difficult to rebalance when assets are held at different locations.  Third, there is often not one person who is looking at how each individual investment, mutual fund, or manager interrelates.  This is critical to avoid overlaps or gaps in a portfolio. These three factors can contribute to greater risk of achieving the prospects goals or objectives.  Offer to review their overall portfolio; with out regard to firms they work with, but rather to look at the portfolio in its entirety to make certain that they are not exposed to these three risk factors.  Connect this next step to your process and set the appropriate expectation for what you will do, what the outcome will be and the time and information required from them.  Then close for the next appointment.</li><li> <strong>  Long-term prospect </strong> &ndash; Be honest.  Let &lsquo;em know your opinion, but check to see if there might be any changes coming.  &ldquo;It sounds like you have a good handle on things.  Tell me, is there anything you see on the horizon that might cause you to rethink the way you have things organized?&rdquo;  You may find out that their current advisor is nearing retirement, then what will they do?  That could move them into &ldquo;qualified prospect&rdquo; territory.  Otherwise go back to the points in your branding message that reinforce the things they find most valuable and then ask for introductions to people they know who should be working with someone like you.</li><li> <strong>  Non-prospect </strong> &ndash; They could be a non prospect because they are not financially qualified or it could be because they are not someone who wants or values advice (you know, self directed and proud of it).  If it is because they are not financially qualified you can go back to the &ldquo;profile of the client you can help the most&rdquo; and how your practice is really aligned for people with those asset levels.  If they are in need of planning help, suggest an alternative that they may consider.  Perhaps a rookie advisor in you office.  If they are a non-prospect because they are not a good fit for the advice model, go back to the points in your branding message that demonstrate that you are in the advice business.  Congratulate them on their ability manage all of this and to have the luxury of the time required.  Go back to the points of your branding message that connect to how your practice is aimed at helping people who don&rsquo;t have the time or expertise to do this for themselves, and who want and value advice.  In either case, remind them of the &ldquo;profile of the client that you can help the most&rdquo; and ask if they know of anyone they could introduce you to.</li><p> <br/> I hope this helps. </p>",

    "content": "<p> The word &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; is probably the only four letter word I never heard in my 24 years as an FBI agent. As Agents we were trained early not to let negativity impair our ability to analyze a tough case that looked impossible to crack. With enough chipping away, and digging, we searched for answers until all leads were exhausted. <u>  Mental toughness </u>  was keeping our thoughts under control as we searched for and found ways to keep moving. The key was a flexible and agile mind that refused to let barriers and adversity define the outcome of a case.It&rsquo;s not only FBI cases that need the  <u>  mental toughness to see success </u> . Everything from business, love, and relationships can become affected by our negativity if we allow it to raise its ugly head. <u>  <a href=\"http://lesbrown.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Les Brown  </a> </u>  once said that 80% of self-talk is negative. Our mind produces the mental toughness we need to succeed; it also produces the negativity that can paralyze us. This means you need to pay more attention to ways your mind produces thoughts that are lies because these are the thoughts that keep you from moving ahead in business and life.Witnesses are always important in FBI investigations because they are first-hand observations. In the same way, you need to witness your thoughts and observe them so you are in a better position to eliminate their negative influence.9 ways your thoughts lie to you: <strong>  1. Using the Words &ldquo;Always&rdquo; and &ldquo;Never.&rdquo; </strong> If you use  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Brain-Life-breakthrough-ebook/dp/B000S1LEO2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392509128&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=change+your+brain+change+your+life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the words always and never  </a> </u>  when you&rsquo;re confronted with an obstacle or barrier, you activate the limbic brain system. This produces emotions like fear and anger. Absolutes like &ldquo;always&rdquo; and &ldquo;never&rdquo; are rarely correct.</p><li> &ldquo;My children never listen to me.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;I never get recognized for my hard work.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Everyone always takes advantage of me.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;I always end up on the short end of the deal.&rdquo;</li>This is very common thinking, but if you catch yourself thinking in terms of absolutes, stop and make yourself recall times when you can disprove the negative thought.<strong> 2. Focusing On the Negative</strong>When your thoughts focus only on the negative, you fail to see the positive around you. Looking for and finding only the negative in your situation will not only make you feel sad, it will prevent you from recognizing your blessings. <u> <a href=\"http://www.marcandangel.com/2014/02/05/25-things-you-need-to-stop-wasting-time-on/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Just because you&rsquo;re struggling doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re failing </a></u>.<strong> 3. Believing In the Negative</strong>Question your negative feelings; don&rsquo;t act on them without thinking them through. Since we all have a negativity bias, it&rsquo;s easier to believe a situation will turn negative than positive. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Brain-Practical-Neuroscience-Happiness-ebook/dp/B003TU29WU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392509967&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+buddha+brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Negative thoughts are like Velcro; they stick. Positive thoughts are like Teflon; they easily fall away </u> . </a><strong> 4. Predicting the Future</strong>Do not be tempted to predict the worst possible outcome. Many times we think that by predicting a negative outcome it will lessen our disappointment. For example, if you don&rsquo;t get promoted or get a business loan&mdash;or whatever we&rsquo;re seeking. In fact, all it does is reduce our chances for feeling good about what we&rsquo;re doing now.<strong> 5. Reading Minds</strong>Don&rsquo;t waste time assuming what people think about you&mdash;you are not a mind reader. We try to guess what others are thinking, it&rsquo;s usually <u> <a href=\"http://addicted2success.com/life/the-5-hidden-warning-signs-that-you-have-low-self-confidence-and-how-to-fix-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  comes from a negative attitude </a></u> we have about the person. Instead, learn to communicate your thoughts and feelings before loosing an opportunity or becoming bitter.<strong> 6. Beating Yourself Up with Guilt</strong>Not every emotion we feel is important or rational. When you feel guilty about something, be skeptical. Is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion)\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  guilt </u>  </a>trying to teach you something rational and helpful about your behavior? Or, is it an irrational response to a situation? This is the first step. The key, however, is to realize the mistake and accept that you&rsquo;re only human. Do not beat yourself up and batter your self-esteem because you&rsquo;re not perfect.<strong> 7. Labeling</strong>When we judge others, we are labeling them.

    "content": "<p> In honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we would like to revisit one of the maverick's lesser known speeches.  \"The American Dream,\" included below in full, was delivered on July 4, 1965 in Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, just two years after his historic \"I Have a Dream\" speech.  In it, he reflects on persisting inequality across the country and remarks that the dream he once spoke of had \"often turned into a nightmare.\"</p><p> I planned to use for the textual basis for our thinking together that passage from the prologue of the book of Job where Satan is pictured as asking God, \"Does Job serve thee for nought?\" And I&rsquo;d like to ask you to allow me to hold that sermon [ \"Why Serve God?\" ] in abeyance and preach it the next time I am in the pulpit in order to share with you some other ideas. This morning I was riding to the airport in Washington, D.C., and on the way to the airport the limousine passed by the Jefferson monument, and Reverend Andrew Young, my executive assistant, said to me, \"It&rsquo;s quite coincidental that we would be passing by the Jefferson Monument on Independence Day.\" You can get so busy in life that you forget holidays and other days, and it had slipped my mind altogether that today was the Fourth of July. And I said to him, \"It is coincidental and quite significant, and I think when I get to Atlanta and go to my pulpit, I will try to preach a sermon in the spirit of the founding fathers of our nation and in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence.\" And so this morning I would like to use as a subject from which to preach: \"The American Dream.\" ( Yes, sir )</p><p> It wouldn&rsquo;t take us long to discover the substance of that dream. It is found in those majestic words of the Declaration of Independence, words lifted to cosmic proportions: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by God, Creator, with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\" This is a dream. It&rsquo;s a great dream.</p><p> The first saying we notice in this dream is an amazing universalism. It doesn&rsquo;t say \"some men,\" it says \"all men.\" It doesn&rsquo;t say \"all white men,\" it says \"all men,\" which includes black men. It does not say \"all Gentiles,\" it says \"all men,\" which includes Jews. It doesn&rsquo;t say \"all Protestants,\" it says \"all men,\" which includes Catholics. ( Yes, sir ) It doesn&rsquo;t even say \"all theists and believers,\" it says \"all men,\" which includes humanists and agnostics.</p><p> Then that dream goes on to say another thing that ultimately distinguishes our nation and our form of government from any totalitarian system in the world. It says that each of us has certain basic rights that are neither derived from or conferred by the state. In order to discover where they came from, it is necessary to move back behind the dim mist of eternity. They are God-given, gifts from His hands. Never before in the history of the world has a sociopolitical document expressed in such profound, eloquent, and unequivocal language the dignity and the worth of human personality.  The American dream reminds us, and we should think about it anew on this Independence Day, that every man is an heir of the legacy of dignity and worth.</p><p> Now ever since the founding fathers of our nation dreamed this dream in all of its magnificence&mdash;to use a big word that the psychiatrists use&mdash;America has been something of a schizophrenic personality, tragically divided against herself. On the one hand we have proudly professed the great principles of democracy, but on the other hand we have sadly practiced the very opposite of those principles.</p><p> But now more than ever before, America is challenged to realize its dream, for the shape of the world today does not permit our nation the luxury of an anemic democracy. And the price that America must pay for the continued oppression of the Negro and other minority groups is the price of its own destruction. ( Yes it is ) For the hour is late. And the clock of destiny is ticking out. We must act now before it is too late.</p><p> And so it is marvelous and great that we do have a dream, that we have a nation with a dream; and to forever challenge us; to forever give us a sense of urgency; to forever stand in the midst of the \"isness\" of our terrible injustices; to remind us of the \"oughtness\" of our noble capacity for justice and love and brotherhood.</p><p> This morning I would like to deal with some of the challenges that we face today in our nation as a result of the American dream. First, I want to reiterate the fact that we are challenged more than ever before to respect the dignity and the worth of all human personality. We are challenged to really believe that all men are created equal. And don&rsquo;t misunderstand that. It does not mean that all men are created equal in terms of native endowment, in terms of intellectual capacity&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t mean that. There are certain bright stars in the human firmament in every field. ( Yes, sir ) It doesn&rsquo;t mean that every musician is equal to a Beethoven or Handel, a Verdi or a Mozart. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that every physicist is equal to an Einstein. It does not mean that every literary figure in history is equal to Aeschylus and Euripides, Shakespeare and Chaucer. ( Make it plain ) It does not mean that every philosopher is equal to Plato, Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Hegel. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that. There are individuals who do excel and rise to the heights of genius in their areas and in their fields. What it does mean is that all men are equal in intrinsic worth. ( Yes )</p><p> You see, the founding fathers were really influenced by the Bible. The whole concept of the  imago dei , as it is expressed in Latin, the \"image of God,\" is the idea that all men have something within them that God injected. Not that they have substantial unity with God, but that every man has a capacity to have fellowship with God. And this gives him a uniqueness, it gives him worth, it gives him dignity. And we must never forget this as a nation: there are no gradations in the image of God. Every man from a treble white to a bass black is significant on God&rsquo;s keyboard, precisely because every man is made in the image of God. One day we will learn that. ( Yes ) We will know one day that God made us to live together as brothers and to respect the dignity and worth of every man.</p><p> This is why we must fight segregation with all of our nonviolent might. ( Yes, sir; Make it plain ) Segregation is not only inconvenient&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t what makes it wrong. Segregation is not only sociologically untenable&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t what makes it wrong. Segregation is not only politically and economically unsound&mdash;that is not what makes it wrong. Ultimately, segregation is morally wrong and sinful. To use the words of a great Jewish philosopher that died a few days ago, Martin Buber, \"It&rsquo;s wrong because it substitutes an &lsquo;I-It&rsquo; relationship for the &lsquo;I-Thou&rsquo; relationship and relegates persons to the status of things.\" That&rsquo;s it. ( Yes, sir )</p><p> I remember when Mrs. King and I were in India, we journeyed down one afternoon to the southernmost part of India, the state of Kerala, the city of Trivandrum. That afternoon I was to speak in one of the schools, what we would call high schools in our country, and it was a school attended by and large by students who were the children of former untouchables. Now you know in India, there was the caste system&mdash;and India has done a marvelous job in grappling with this problem&mdash;but you had your full caste and individuals were in one of the castes. And then you had some sixty or seventy million people who were considered outcasts. They were the untouchables; they could not go places that other people went; they could not do certain things. And this was one of the things that Mahatma Gandhi battled&mdash;along with his struggle to end the long night of colonialism&mdash;also to end the long night of the caste system and caste untouchability. You remember some of his great fasts were around the question of making equality a reality for the Harijans, as they were called, the \"untouchables.\" He called them the children of God, and he even adopted an untouchable as his daughter. He demonstrated in his own personal life and in his family that he was going to revolt against a whole idea. And I remember that afternoon when I stood up in that school. The principal introduced me and then as he came to the conclusion of his introduction, he says, \"Young people, I would like to present to you a fellow untouchable from the United States of America.\" And for the moment I was a bit shocked and peeved that I would be referred to as an untouchable. ( Glory to God )</p><p> Pretty soon my mind dashed back across the mighty Atlantic. And I started thinking about the fact that at that time no matter how much I needed to rest my tired body after a long night of travel, I couldn&rsquo;t stop in the average motel of the highways and the hotels of the cities of the South. I started thinking about the fact that no matter how long an old Negro woman had been shopping downtown and got a little tired and needed to get a hamburger or a cup of coffee at a lunch counter, she couldn&rsquo;t get it there. ( Preach ) I started thinking about the fact that still in too many instances, Negroes have to go to the back of the bus and have to stand up over empty seats. ( Yes, sir ) I started thinking about the fact that my children and the other children that would be born would have to go to segregated schools. I started thinking about the fact: twenty million of my brothers and sisters were still smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in an affluent society. I started thinking about the fact: ( Make it plain ) these twenty million brothers and sisters were still by and large housed in rat-infested, unendurable slums in the big cities of our nation, still attended inadequate schools faced with improper recreational facilities. And I said to myself, \"Yes, I am an untouchable, and every Negro in the United States of America is an untouchable.\" And this is the evilness of segregation: it stigmatizes the segregated as an untouchable in a caste system. We hold these truths to be self-evident, if we are to be a great nation, that all men ( all men ) are created equal. God&rsquo;s black children are as significant as his white children. ( Yes, sir ) \"We hold these truths to be self-evident.\" One day we will learn this.</p><p> The other day Mrs. King and I spent about ten days down in Jamaica. I&rsquo;d gone down to deliver the commencement address at the University of the West Indies. I always love to go that great island which I consider the most beautiful island in all the world. The government prevailed upon us to be their guests and spend some time and try to get a little rest while there on the speaking tour. And so for those days we traveled all over Jamaica. And over and over again I was impressed by one thing. Here you have people from many national backgrounds: Chinese, Indians, so-called Negroes, and you can just go down the line, Europeans, European and people from many, many nations. Do you know they all live there and they have a motto in Jamaica, \"Out of many people, one people.\" And they say, \"Here in Jamaica we are not Chinese, ( Make it plain ) we are not Japanese, we are not Indians, we are not Negroes, we are not Englishmen, we are not Canadians. But we are all one big family of Jamaicans.\" One day, here in America, I hope that we will see this and we will become one big family of Americans. Not white Americans, not black Americans, not Jewish or Gentile Americans, not Irish or Italian Americans, not Mexican Americans, not Puerto Rican Americans, but just Americans. One big family of Americans.</p><p> And I tell you this morning, my friends, the reason we got to solve this problem here in America: Because God somehow called America to do a special job for mankind and the world. ( Yes, sir, Make it plain ) Never before in the history of the world have so many racial groups and so many national backgrounds assembled together in one nation. And somehow if we can&rsquo;t solve the problem in America the world can&rsquo;t solve the problem, because America is the world in miniature and the world is America writ large. And God set us out with all of the opportunities. ( Make it plain ) He set us between two great oceans; ( Yes, sir ) made it possible for us to live with some of the great natural resources of the world. And there he gave us through the minds of our forefathers a great creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men ( Yes, sir ) are created equal.\"</p><p> Now that doesn&rsquo;t only apply on the race issue, it applies on the class question. You know, sometimes a class system can be as vicious and evil as a system based on racial injustice. ( Yes, sir ) When we say, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\" and when we live it out, we know as I say so often that the \"no D.\" is as significant as the \"Ph.D.\" And the man who has been to \"No House\" is as significant as the man who&rsquo;s been to Morehouse. ( Make it plain today ) We build our little class systems, and you know you got a lot of Negroes with classism in their veins. ( Sure ) You know that they don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with certain other Negroes and they try to separate themselves from them. ( Amen )</p><p> I remember when I was in theological school, and we were coming to the end of our years there, a classmate&mdash;he came to me to talk with me&mdash;said that he wanted to invite his mother up. And she&rsquo;d struggled in order to help him get through school. He wanted to invite his mother up, but he said, \"You know, the problem is I don&rsquo;t know if she would quite fit in this atmosphere. You know, her verbs aren&rsquo;t quite right; and she doesn&rsquo;t know how to dress too well; she lives in a rural area.\" And I wanted to say to him so bad that you aren&rsquo;t fit to finish this school. ( Yes ) If you cannot acknowledge your mother, if you cannot acknowledge your brothers and sisters, even if they have not risen to the heights of educational attainment, then you aren&rsquo;t fit ( Have mercy ) to go out and try to preach to men and women. ( Amen )</p><p> Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you this morning, and you learn this and you discover the meaning of \"God&rsquo;s image.\" You&rsquo;ll know what the New Testament means when it says that \"I revealed it to babes and so often withheld it from the wise.\" And I have learned a great deal in my few years, not only from the philosophers that I have studied with in the universities, not only from the theologians and the psychologists and the historians, but so often from that humble human being who didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to get an education but who had something basic deep down within. ( Yes ) Sometimes Aunt Jane on her knees can get more truth than the philosopher on his tiptoes. ( Yes, Amen ) And this is what \"all men are made in the image of God\" tells us. We must believe this and we must live by it. ( Yes )</p><p> This is why we must join the war against poverty ( Yes, sir ) and believe in the dignity of all work. What makes a job menial? I&rsquo;m tired of this stuff about menial labor. What makes it menial is that we don&rsquo;t pay folk anything. ( Yes, sir ) Give somebody a job and pay them some money so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life. And no matter what the job is it takes on dignity.</p><p> I submit to you when I took off on that plane this morning, I saw men go out there in their overalls. ( Yes, sir, Every time ) I saw them working on things here and there, and saw some more going out there to put the breakfast on there so that we could eat on our way to Atlanta. ( Make it plain ) And I said to myself that these people who constitute the ground crew are just as significant as the pilot, because this plane couldn&rsquo;t move if you didn&rsquo;t have the ground crew. ( Amen ) I submit to you that in Hugh Spaulding or Grady Hospital, ( Preach it ) the woman or the man who goes in there to sweep the floor is just as significant as the doctor, ( Yes ) because if he doesn&rsquo;t get that dust off the floor germs will begin to circulate. And those same germs can do injury and harm to the human being. I submit to you this morning ( Yes ) that there is dignity in all work ( Have mercy ) when we learn to pay people decent wages. Whoever cooks in your house, whoever sweeps the floor in your house is just as significant as anybody who lives in that house. ( Amen ) And everybody that we call a maid is serving God in a significant way. ( Preach it ) And I love the maids, I love the people who have been ignored, and I want to see them get the kind of wages that they need. And their job is no longer a menial job, ( No, sir ) for you come to see its worth and its dignity.</p><p> Are we really taking this thing seriously? \"All men are created equal.\" ( Amen ) And that means that every man who lives in a slum today ( Preach it ) is just as significant as John D., Nelson, or any other Rockefeller. Every man who lives in the slum is just as significant as Henry Ford. All men are created equal, and they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, rights that can&rsquo;t be separated from you. [ clap ] Go down and tell them, ( No ) \"You may take my life, but you can&rsquo;t take my right to life. You may take liberty from me, but you can&rsquo;t take my right to liberty. You may take from me the desire, you may take from me the propensity to pursue happiness, but you can&rsquo;t take from me my right to pursue happiness.\" ( Yes ) \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights and among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\" ( Yes, sir )</p><p> Now there&rsquo;s another thing that we must never forget. If we are going to make the American dream a reality, ( Yes ) we are challenged to work in an action program to get rid of the last vestiges of segregation and discrimination. This problem isn&rsquo;t going to solve itself, however much [ word inaudible ] people tell us this. However much the Uncle Toms and Nervous Nellies in the Negro communities tell us this, this problem isn&rsquo;t just going to work itself out. ( No, sir ) History is the long story of the fact ( Yes ) that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges without strong resistance, and they seldom do it voluntarily. And so if the American dream is to be a reality, we must work to make it a reality and realize the urgency of the moment. And we must say now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to get rid of segregation and discrimination. Now is the time to make Georgia a better state. Now is the time to make the United States a better nation. ( Yes ) We must live with that, and we must believe that.</p><p> And I would like to say to you this morning what I&rsquo;ve tried to say all over this nation, what I believe firmly: that in seeking to make the dream a reality we must use and adopt a proper method. I&rsquo;m more convinced than ever before that nonviolence is the way. I&rsquo;m more convinced than ever before that violence is impractical as well as immoral. If we are to build right here a better America, we have a method ( Yes, sir ) as old as the insights of Jesus of Nazareth and as modern as the techniques of Mohandas K. Gandhi. We need not hate; we need not use violence. We can stand up before our most violent opponent and say: We will match your capacity to inflict suffering by our capacity to endure suffering. We will meet your physical force with soul force. ( Make it plain ) Do to us what you will and we will still love you. We cannot in all good conscience obey your unjust laws, because noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good, and so throw us in jail. ( Make it plain ) We will go in those jails and transform them from dungeons of shame to havens of freedom and human dignity. Send your hooded perpetrators of violence into our communities after midnight hours and drag us out on some wayside road and beat us and leave us half-dead, and as difficult as it is, we will still love you. ( Amen ) Somehow go around the country and use your propaganda agents to make it appear that we are not fit culturally, morally, or otherwise for integration, and we will still love you. ( Yes ) Threaten our children and bomb our homes, and as difficult as it is, we will still love you. ( Yeah )</p><p> But be assured that we will ride you down by our capacity to suffer. One day we will win our freedom, but we will not only win freedom for ourselves, we will so appeal to your heart and your conscience that we will win you in the process.\" And our victory will be a double victory.</p><p> Oh yes, love is the way. ( Yes ) Love is the only absolute. More and more I see this. I&rsquo;ve seen too much hate to want to hate myself; hate is too great a burden to bear. ( You bet, Yes ) I&rsquo;ve seen it on the faces of too many sheriffs of the South&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen hate. In the faces and even the walk of too many Klansmen of the South, I&rsquo;ve seen hate. Hate distorts the personality. Hate does something to the soul that causes one to lose his objectivity. The man who hates can&rsquo;t think straight; ( Amen ) the man who hates can&rsquo;t reason right; the man who hates can&rsquo;t see right; the man who hates can&rsquo;t walk right. ( Yeah ) And I know now that Jesus is right, ( Yeah ) that love is the way. And this is why John said, \"God is love,\" ( Yes, sir ) so that he who hates does not know God, but he who loves ( get in the door ) at that moment has the key that opens the door ( Yeah ) to the meaning of ultimate reality. So this morning there is so much that we have to offer to the world. ( Yes, sir )</p><p> We have a great dream. ( Great dream ) It started way back in 1776, and God grant that America will be true to her dream.</p><p> About two years ago now, I stood with many of you who stood there in person and all of you who were there in spirit before the Lincoln Monument in Washington. ( Yes ) As I came to the end of my speech there, I tried to tell the nation about a dream I had. I must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering August afternoon in 1963, my dream has often turned into a nightmare; ( Lord ) I&rsquo;ve seen it shattered. I saw it shattered one night on Highway 80 in Alabama when Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was shot down. ( Lord, Lord ) I had a nightmare and saw my dream shattered one night in Marion, Alabama, when Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot down. ( Lord ) I saw my dream shattered one night in Selma when Reverend Reeb was clubbed to the ground by a vicious racist and later died. And oh, I continue to see it shattered as I walk through the Harlems of our nation ( Yes ) and see sometimes ten and fifteen Negroes trying to live in one or two rooms. ( Yes ) I&rsquo;ve been down to the Delta of Mississippi since then, and I&rsquo;ve seen my dream shattered as I met hundreds of people who didn&rsquo;t earn more than six or seven hundred dollars a week. I&rsquo;ve seen my dream shattered as I&rsquo;ve walked the streets of Chicago ( Make it plain ) and seen Negroes, young men and women, with a sense of utter hopelessness because they can&rsquo;t find any jobs. And they see life as a long and desolate corridor with no exit signs. And not only Negroes at this point. I&rsquo;ve seen my dream shattered because I&rsquo;ve been through Appalachia, and I&rsquo;ve seen my white brothers along with Negroes living in poverty. ( Yeah ) And I&rsquo;m concerned about white poverty as much as I&rsquo;m concerned about Negro poverty. ( Make it plain )</p><p> So yes, the dream has been shattered, ( Amen ) and I have had my nightmarish experiences, but I tell you this morning once more that I haven&rsquo;t lost the faith. ( No, sir ) I still have a dream (A  dream, Yes, sir ) that one day all of God&rsquo;s children will have food and clothing and material well-being for their bodies, culture and education for their minds, and freedom for their spirits. ( Yes )</p><p> I still have a dream this morning: ( Yes ) one day all of God&rsquo;s black children will be respected like his white children.</p><p> I still have a dream this morning ( Yes ) that one day the lion and the lamb will lie down together, and every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree and none shall be afraid.</p><p> I still have a dream this morning that one day all men everywhere will recognize that out of one blood God made all men to dwell upon the face of the earth.</p><p> I still have a dream this morning ( Yes, sir ) that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill will be made low; the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.</p><p> I still have a dream this morning ( Amen ) that truth will reign supreme and all of God&rsquo;s children will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. And when this day comes the morning stars will sing together ( Yes ) and the sons of God will shout for joy.</p><p> \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men ( All right ) are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, ( Yes, sir ) that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\"</p><p> We open the doors of the church now. If someone needs to accept Christ, ( Yes, sir ) this is a marvelous opportunity, a great moment to make a decision. And as we sing together, we bid you come at this time by Christian experience, baptism, watch care. But come at this moment, become a part of this great Christian fellowship and accept Christ ( Yes, sir ) as your personal savior.</p>",

    "content": "<p>A recent Brookings Institution report confirms for the first time how severely uninformed many college freshman are about the impact of the debts they&rsquo;re taking on to fund their education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t entirely surprising. But with tuitions continually rising and students now often forced to borrow the equivalent of a house down payment by the time they graduate, the Brookings findings should serve as a wake-up call:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Half of the full-time freshmen surveyed &ldquo;seriously underestimated&rdquo; how much they were borrowing.</li>\r\n\t<li>Among students known to have federal college loans, four out of 10 either said they didn&rsquo;t have any federal loans or didn&rsquo;t have any debt at all.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the report, &ldquo;Students who do not have a good idea of their level of borrowing may make expensive mistakes that they will later come to regret.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that students remain in the dark. By the time they&rsquo;re finishing college, the prospect of burdensome payments can discourage students from pursuing their passion or seeking employment that is more personally rewarding than it is remunerative. One 2011 <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13117\" target=\"_blank\"> study </a> found that graduates with debt gravitate to higher-salary jobs and are less likely to go into lower-paying public interest jobs, such as teaching or government and non-profit professions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For other students, the first realization of the consequences can come when they&rsquo;re &ldquo;surprised or even fearful&rdquo; about the size of their first monthly loan payment after graduating, the study said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems unrealistic to expect teenagers fresh out of high school to foresee the ramifications of substantial debt. So who is responsible for making sure they don&rsquo;t walk blindly into such a critical financial decision?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iris.xyz/research/why-college-is-never-coming-back\">Why College Is Never Coming Back</a></p>",

    "title": "Smart Rules for Smart Women",
    "link": "smart-rules-for-smart-women",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The scarcity of senior women leaders at the top creates a need for a new paradigm on how women show up in the workplace. We are no longer constrained by the glass ceiling because we get to break through it if we can learn a new way of showing up. It&rsquo;s time for the girls to take their place at the top without excuses.</p><p> Marcus Buckingham said it best; &ldquo;Break ALL The Rules!&rdquo;</p><p> Women have a need to take care of others. For the most part, it&rsquo;s in our DNA. That&rsquo;s why evolution made us the mothers in society. But the problem is we focus too much on taking care of others, and we leave little time for ourselves, our career, and our life goals.</p><p> We need new rules. And we must continue to break them as we reinvent new ones. It&rsquo;s the natural cycle of growth and change.</p><p> <strong>  Rule #1 &ndash; TAKE CENTER STAGE </strong></p><p> You are the most important person in your life. A friend shared with me a conversation she had with her husband when she said, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; his response was, &ldquo;I love you too, but I love me more.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s a telling response since he had a very good sense of his value in the world, and that self-love equals greater love for those around you. <br/> Be the caretaker, the mother, the compassionate sister of mercy, but PLEASE make sure you are taking care of you first. Just like the mask on an airplane, you need to put it on first. No one notices wall flowers, but they notice the redhead with the sassy walk, and the full of herself attitude that gets things done.</p><p> <strong>  Rule #2 &ndash; PROCEED UNTIL APPREHENDED </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s okay to maintain your collaboration, your caring, and your nurturing self, but please don&rsquo;t ask if it&rsquo;s okay if you proceed. Act decisively to make things happen. Stop asking permission and start putting forward these great ideas you&rsquo;ve been sitting on, and start campaigning for the roles you want. Nobody gets very far when you&rsquo;re waiting on other people to make the decision for you. And if there&rsquo;s someone standing in front of you with a know-it all attitude, then your job is to come prepared with the right information and start the conversation to move your goals forward.</p><p> <strong>  Rule #3 &ndash; PROJECT THE POWER OF YOU </strong></p><p> Why do we continue to ask people if it&rsquo;s all right? Or apologizing for taking up space by saying &ldquo;sorry to bother you.&rdquo; You know what I&rsquo;m saying. That Uriah Heep &lsquo;ever-so-humble&rsquo; stuff that gets in the way of making decisions and taking the actions that lead you forward. Modesty is fine in moderation, but too many times women take it to the extreme. What happens? They get passed over, ignored, undermined. Enough of that. Stop apologizing for your success. Own It! You deserve it. If you&rsquo;re not feeling confident about that, then fake it until you believe it. Stand up tall, plant your feet and take a deep breath with your arms extended. Fill the room with you, and then go the meeting. Make eye contact, watch that little girl voice, and match your facial expression with that powerful body of yours. Watch the reactions in the room and take credit for who you are. Strong, Smart and Capable.</p><p> <strong>  Rule #4 &ndash; BE POLITICALLY SAVVY </strong></p><p> Okay. We know it&rsquo;s 4.30am and you&rsquo;re working on that presentation you are giving in two weeks&rsquo; time! I also know you worked at least 60 hours last week, attended three networking events, and put in time with your family while doing household chores. While no one could accuse you of being a slacker, your stress is beginning to show. Is this serving you? Could you do it differently? A few easy questions.</p><p> Are you developing a strong network of meaningful connections to extend your influence? Do you have a clear vision of what you want to achieve and who could help you get there? Are you building strong alliances, sponsors and collaborations to achieve your desires? If you&rsquo;re not doing all of this, then start now. You have more support around you than you think. Start looking for it.</p><p> <strong>  Rule #5 &ndash; PLAY TO WIN </strong></p><p> Are you a door opener who allows other people to walk in first? Do you feel like the other person has a better reason to be there before you? Are other people&rsquo;s desires more important than your own?</p><p> Now, I&rsquo;m not asking you to behave like a hole that begins with an A&hellip;but do you really want to come in second? Playing it safe is staying in your comfort zone, which, let&rsquo;s get honest here, is really your discomfort zone. Decades of resentment and frustration at watching someone else get all the accolades, the work, the benefits takes its toll.</p><p> So here&rsquo;s what I want you to think about the next time you give someone the space to go ahead of you. Stop it! Seize the opportunity to show what you&rsquo;re made of. Talk about the contributions you&rsquo;re making. Ask for what you want, and expect to get it. Take bigger risks, and make yourself visible at the next meeting, the next conversation, the next confrontation. Take on high-stakes projects that you have no idea in hell if they will work, but you&rsquo;re willing to take the risk and use your ingenuity, your creativity, and your masterful sense of self-worth to make it happen. Build your credibility and your influence by showing up in the best places, giving your ideas an airing, and asking how you can serve others with a view to serving your own needs too.</p><p> You were born to win!</p><p> <strong>  Rule #6 &ndash; EMBRACE ALL PERSPECTIVES </strong></p><p> Life is not an either/or. It&rsquo;s a both/and choice. Choice is always present, and even when you think you don&rsquo;t have a choice, you make one by choosing nothing. Learning how to be flexible, and deal with ambiguity is the mark of great self-awareness, self-control and mastery of your emotions. Next time you are confronted with the either/or stop and think if there is another alternative. How can you satisfy your own needs, and the needs of another? My favorite quote is from Tony Robbins who said; &ldquo;The quality of your life is determined by how much uncertainty you can comfortably live with!&rdquo; Embracing all perspectives means that there are no comfortable answers, but you are willing to explore possibilities. Be compassionate, be generous, and be humble. We don&rsquo;t know all the answers, but the fun is in the discovery of what they are. Lend a hand to someone who is on the way up, stop and inquire how someone else is doing, and suspend all judgment so you can be open to receiving amazing information that will elevate your life to new heights.</p>",

    "title": "Boomers: Will You Need Care In Your Own Future?",
    "link": "boomers-will-you-need-care-in-your-own-future",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Millions of us Boomers are caring for an aging parent.  Some take their loved one into their home, and some move to be closer to the aging parent. Some provide care from a distance. Some live nearby and do a great deal, often on a daily basis for their family member.  Many see parents living to surprisingly old age and see the amount of care their loved one requires.</p><p> I have a friend whose grandmother was very independent for quite a long time, but she had a stroke and fell. Everyone thought she was at her end.  Her granddaughter, in her 60&rsquo;s, moved grandma to a care facility near the granddaughter&rsquo;s home. Grandma didn&rsquo;t recognize anyone at first. They planned for her demise.  But she pulled through.  She&rsquo;s going on 105 years old now and her health seems to be stable.  She is improving, though still very frail.</p><p> Grandma, in this case, has assets.  She is paying for her own ruinously expensive care facility, which required supplementing the staff with a private caregiver from outside the home.  She has &ldquo;graduated&rdquo; from that level of need now and isn&rsquo;t ready to die just yet.  But what if grandma didn&rsquo;t have any money? Her family would provide for her.   Imagine you are in grandma&rsquo;s shoes.</p><p> Many people simply do not want to face this issue, or somehow believe that they will avoid needing long-term care.  According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, &ldquo;Someone turning age 65 today has almost a 70 percent chance of needing some type of long-term care services and supports in their remaining years.&rdquo; About 35 percent of aging individuals will need nursing facility care.  That&rsquo;s us, too, not just our parents and grandparents.</p>Here are 3 things every Boomer should do if you do not want to become a burden to your kids when you&rsquo;re older.<br/> <li> <strong>  Face the facts:   </strong> we all may need help as we get up there in years.  If the odds of needing long term care and support are 7 in 10, we need to accept the truth of this and not think &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t happen to me&rdquo;.  Accepting the truth means we think it through, and start the plan now, in our 60s or 70s.</li><li> <strong>  Talk about the future with your family members.   </strong> Let them know what you have in the bank, what your Social Security and any other income is expected to be at retirement age.  If you plan to keep working in your &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; years, as many Boomers will, project what you may be able to earn and save.  Discuss what you would need to earn or have saved if you needed long term support at home or in a care facility. If you don&rsquo;t know the costs, contact your Area Agency on Aging and get the local expenses for home help or a care facility, such as assisted living.</li><li> <strong>  Get legal advice about whether Medicaid could be an option for you. </strong>  If you do not have much saved, and your income is not going to be much, now is the time to find out about eligibility in your state for Medicaid.  Medicaid is an insurance program for low income people (regardless of age), who do not have many assets. The rules very considerably from state to state.  By spending a little time and a modest amount of money on competent advice, you can learn well ahead of time what you would need to do to qualify for the program.  If you could qualify, Medicaid could cover many services for you that are not covered by anything else, particularly Medicare.  In most states, whatever you do to move or give away assets to qualify you must be done 5 years in advance so that you do not incur a penalty when you need Medicaid. <br/>  </li><p> I&rsquo;ve heard some friends in their 60s remark: &ldquo;If I got to the point where I couldn&rsquo;t take care of myself, I&rsquo;d shoot myself&rdquo;.  Well, that&rsquo;s actually not what happens. Age related disabilities like dementia sneak up on you.  You probably won&rsquo;t be thinking of ending it all as you are still able to do many of the things you enjoy.  Needing some help is typically not an all or nothing proposition.  We just need to be realistic about it.</p><p> I hope I am persuading you why we independent, freedom loving Boomers must recognize that we will probably not be as vigorous at 85 as we might be at 55 or 65.  We just might need someone to give us a hand.  And it&rsquo;s not free.  So, planning ahead as early as we can makes perfect sense.  Make it your resolution.  Look down the road and be ready for your own future.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As you plan your strategies for growth this year, there are three things you should do to increase your opportunity for success in your 401k practice.</p><p> <strong>  One: Set Goals </strong></p><p> The first one is to set goals. Only 3% of adults have clear, written, specific, measurable, time-bounded goals, and by every statistic, they accomplish ten times as much as people with no goals at all.</p><p> As you begin your goal-planning activity, answer these questions:</p><li> What was your biggest accomplishment during 2014? (&ldquo;Study the past if you would define the future.&rdquo; ~ Confucius)</li><li> Looking back over the past year, what would have done differently? (&ldquo;More people would learn from their mistakes if they weren&rsquo;t so busy denying them.&rdquo; ~ Zig Ziglar)</li><li> What is our #1 business goal for 2015&hellip;If you could accomplish only one thing this year, what would it be? (&ldquo;You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight.&rdquo; ~ Jim Rohn)</li><li> Why is this goal important to you and what do you think is needed to accomplish this goal? (&ldquo;Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.&rdquo;) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Two: Include Goals that Mean Something to Your Client </strong></p><p> Since  <u>  <a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/notforyou/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   being a 401k plan advisor is not about you  </a> </u> , include in your goals what impact or difference you hope to be able to measure in the lives of the participants you serve.  Think about what ruler will you use to measure success this year and how will you define and explain that to your clients and prospects?</p><p> Here are some activities to get you thinking:</p><li> Identify one success or activity from this past year that made an impact on helping participants and plan sponsors achieve their goals for a successful retirement plan?(&ldquo;God calls us not to be successful but to be significant. When we focus on Significance, success is often part of the package.&rdquo; ~ Tom Ziglar) <br/>  </li><p> Here are some examples of what you might list:  Implemented auto escalation on 3 plans affecting 3200 participants in all; Provided education or advice to 500 employees through 18 group meetings, 85 individual consultations, etc.; Negotiated expenses for a plan that reduced costs by 30% and equates to potentially $300 more a month for participants in retirement; Increased deferral rates or % on track for successful retirement; Reduced workload of plan sponsors by changing recordkeepers, etc.</p><li> List at least one goal that, when accomplished, would directly impact successful participant outcomes. (&ldquo;You make a living by what you get; you make a life by what you give.&rdquo;) <br/>  </li><p> Here are some examples of what you might list: Increase average deferral rate from 4% to 6% on the plans I service; Enroll 20% of non-participating (but eligible) participants across all plans I service; Implement re-enrollment and get 80%+ allocation into target-date funds; Benchmark 100% of the plans I service to help plan sponsors ensure their fees are reasonable, etc.</p><p> <strong>  Three: Articulate your Value through the Successful Achievement of Your Goals </strong></p><p> Review the various ways you can articulate your participant-focused goals to differentiate yourself when you talk to plan sponsors &ndash; how you show real, measurable, improvements you make in the client relationships you have.</p><p> You may not have thought about how your activities and successes directly impact participants, but as a 401k advisor, the services you offer generally work for the greater good of the plan and ultimately the benefit of plan participants.</p><p> You should track your service activities and results throughout the year and present this material to plan sponsors during the annual plan review meeting.  You should also use this data when talking to prospects to differentiate yourself and demonstrate your commitment to achieving successful outcomes. The following is a partial list of ways you could track and articulate the value you bring to the table.</p><li> Identify how many education meetings you conduct each year</li><li> List the education topics delivered to participants</li><li> Identify how many individuals you meet with one-on-one</li><li> What % of participants are in target-date or asset allocation funds on the plans you service</li><li> How many individuals are on-track for a successful retirement (according to data analyzed by reports offered by companies like Investment Horizons or Perspective Partners)</li><li> How many time&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve facilitated the removal of unnecessary services</li><li> Incidents where you&rsquo;ve negotiated fees to better align with industry standards</li><li> Situations where you&rsquo;ve quarterbacked a move to a new platform that was more user-friendly</li><li> Number of Investment Committee members you&rsquo;ve trained on ERISA fiduciary roles and responsibilities</li><li> Percentage of plan&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve provided benchmark data for to help ensure reasonableness of fees</li><li> Number of enrollment meetings held or # of new enrollments</li><li> Percentage of plans that have implemented auto enroll or auto escalation</li><li> Average match percentage or match scale on the plans you service if above average</li><li> &hellip;And the list could go on and on. <br/>  </li><p> Think about the services you offer, and describe them to show the benefit your clients gain. Track and share data that works towards achieving more successful participant outcomes.</p><p> You can  <u>  <a href=\"http://401kbestpractices.com/?attachment_id=1259\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   download the complete planning worksheet here  </a> </u>  and I encourage you to go through the complete exercise; set goals, include goals that directly benefit your clients, and track your goals so you can include your results as part of your value proposition. I wish you a most successful 2015!</p>",

    "link": "five-toughest-obstacles-to-innovation",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Denis Story </u></p><p> Innovation is one of the more frustrating examples of &ldquo;easier said than done.&rdquo; Google &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and you get millions of hits. Obviously, not all of those citations &ndash; if even a fraction of them &ndash; refer to genuine innovators. There&rsquo;s just not that much out there or we wouldn&rsquo;t still be driving fossil fuel-powered cars or changing light bulbs every few months.</p><p> So what makes innovation as rare as an honest politician? Five things (or course) immediately spring to mind.</p><p> <strong>  5. Inertia </strong></p><p> Or, as the genius himself, Albert Einstein put it, &ldquo;Nothing happens until something moves.&rdquo; And, sure, it sounds simple enough, but change on even the slightest scale requires more effort than doing nothing at all. How many of us stay in the job, the same relationship, hell, the same town because it&rsquo;s the path of least resistance. Inertia&rsquo;s stronger than gravity when it comes to breaking the same, stagnant orbit.</p><p> <strong>  4. The unknown </strong></p><p> Few things are as frightening, if not downright paralyzing, as the unknown. Sure, this could be the cause for inertia&rsquo;s effect, but it&rsquo;s certainly difficult to think outside the box when you have no clue where the box ends and the unknown begins (with apologies to Schr&ouml;dinger).</p><p> To return to an earlier reference, someone saw past the known (horse travel) into something so completely foreign, that most people didn&rsquo;t even know what to call it at first. Now, we can&rsquo;t imagine life without our horseless carriages.</p><p> <strong>  3. Haters </strong></p><p> And, no, I&rsquo;m not talking Taylor Swift here. We&rsquo;ve all heard the tale of the lobsters in the fishing basket, dragging any of their colleagues down that dare aspire to the escape. I guess you could call it an extreme case of misery loving company. Or maybe it&rsquo;s nothing more than mediocrity hating excellence. It&rsquo;s easier to justify one&rsquo;s own lack of success when you can&rsquo;t point to anyone&rsquo;s else&rsquo;s.</p><p> <strong>  2. Rivals </strong></p><p> Similarly &ndash; and probably most obviously &ndash; there are your rivals, who, of course, want nothing more than to see you fail, or at least maintain the status quo.</p><p> Apple&rsquo;s an excellent example of this. Aside from Samsung&rsquo;s outright design theft, the Korean tech giant (among others) were quick to go to court to stop Apple success with first the iPhone, then the tablets. Besides, shaking up the status quo means they&rsquo;ll have to work harder. And nobody wants that&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  1. Yourself </strong></p><p> And, finally, the single greatest obstacle to innovation is yourself, whether its your own fears, lack of ambition or inability to see beyond the way you do business today. You might even say each of us is our own greatest rival.</p>",

    "title": "Why Women Face More Financial Challenges in Retirement and What to Do about It",
    "link": "why-women-face-more-financial-challenges-in-retirement-and-what-to-do-about-it",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Being a financial advisor requires that I do massive amounts of reading in order to stay abreast of personal financial and economic trends and issues that my clients may face. Which means I am continually inundated with the reality of the state of our economy.</p><p> Quite frankly, it is a gloomy picture, especially for women.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it, throughout history women have been getting the short end of the proverbial stick, especially in the area of financial security.</p><p> For instance, women are painfully aware of the pay gap that exists between the genders. Yes, men still earn more than women when working in the same professions. Yet, we are seeing more and more that women are earning more than their husbands and they are opening new businesses at a rate that outpaces men. Yay for us!</p><p> While evidence of these advances is encouraging, I urge women not to take their eye off of the real issue here, which is that women face a number of financial challenges in retirement.</p><p> <strong>  A number of social and economic factors threaten the financial security of women, especially in retirement. </strong></p><p> Statistically speaking, women outlive men. Not only because men tend to marry younger women, but because women live longer. Which means that if the husband requires extensive (and expensive) medical care before he passes, the wife will be left with depleted savings to live on.</p><p> By the way, financial experts are saying that retirees should plan on spending approximately $240,000 on healthcare costs. That&rsquo;s $240K for each spouse. Yikes!!!</p><p> One of the reasons is obviously the rising costs of healthcare; but also because people are living longer.</p><p> <strong>  Centenarians are the fasting growing age segment of our society. </strong></p><p> The average age a woman becomes widowed is age 59 &frac12;. So, if she lives into her nineties (or to age 100!), she will need at least thirty years of retirement income saved up.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, let me spell it out for you&hellip;..</p><p> <strong>  Women are in danger of out-living their assets in retirement. This is called longevity risk. </strong></p><p> Why is this happening you might ask.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at the reality of how most Americans deal with money:</p><li> <strong>  People are in denial.  </strong> Studies show that people don&rsquo;t realize how much they will need to retire. They think they will need a lot less than they actually do. But the reality is they haven&rsquo;t considered the costs of healthcare and how inflation will erode purchasing power.</li><li> <strong>  Americans are not savers.  </strong> Studies show that 48 percent of Americans do not contribute to their retirement plans. Evidently these people are counting on Social Security. But the reality is additional assets to supplement SSI is necessary in order to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. One source suggests counting on 22 times your desired annual income.</li><li> <strong>  Lack of tax planning.  </strong> People don&rsquo;t know what their taxes will be in retirement, which leaves them at the mercy of future tax rates because a majority of their retirement assets are in qualified plans. Distributions from qualified plans are taxable when they come out (save Roth IRAs). <br/>  </li><p> So, how can a woman prepare for the economic storm ahead and ensure she enjoys a financially secure retirement? In a word&hellip;..</p><p> <strong>  Planning. </strong></p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t been much of a planner with regards to your finances or retirement, here are a few tips to get you connected to your money:</p><li> <strong>  Start talking about money.  </strong> This is a great way to start connecting with your money. Even if you are married, be in the conversation about money and your overall financial wellness, especially your future financial security. For instance, my husband and I have &ldquo;an appointment&rdquo; to sit down together, just he and I, to go over our retirement. We all know we should do this, but if you both put it on the calendar, it&rsquo;s more likely to happen. You can even make it fun by opening a great bottle of wine after (or heck during) the conversation.</li><li> <strong>  Start small.  </strong> If the idea of taking charge of your finances and retirement intimidates you, take baby steps. Arm yourself with information and knowledge. Read and learn as much as you can. (Subscribe to my newsletter so you can receive more articles like this one to keep you motivated.) Also, if you haven&rsquo;t been much of a saver, start small applies here too. Make a decision to start saving today. Right now go open a separate savings account at your bank and set up automatic monthly deposits from your checking account even if it&rsquo;s a small amount. It&rsquo;s the action that matters most to get started.</li><li> <strong>  Start where you are. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of thinking you need to wait until you make more money. Or that you have to wait because you can&rsquo;t afford to save right now. I have many clients who have managed to save plenty of money on annual salaries as low as $40,000. And, I have six-figure income earning clients who didn&rsquo;t have a savings plan before they met me. Your income doesn&rsquo;t matter. Start where you are. <br/>  </li><p> Decide you will become financially savvy with what you have right now. Decide that you will connect with your money, which means you know what you have coming in each month; you know what your expenses are; you know what you need to be saving for retirement; and you know what financial tools will help you get there.</p><p> Want to start taking charge of your finances now?</p><p> If you have questions regarding your finances or you would like to <u>  contact me. </u></p><p> If you want to receive more information on how to take charge of your finances or how to get started on planning for retirement, let&rsquo;s stay connected on social media:</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annettefranz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Annette Franz  </u> </a></p><p> Have you ever felt like the picture to the left describes your workplace?  <br/> <br/> Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude. -Thomas Jefferson  <br/> <br/> When I was in sports in high school, I was told that a positive mental attitude was everything - you can't win without it. I agreed, and I still believe a positive mental attitude has many benefits. You have to agree that moping around, being a Debbie Downer, and thinking you can't do something will certainly set you up for failure. And, quite frankly, that's depressing. It's way more fun to be happy. <br/> <br/> <strong>  OK, so let's think positive for a minute. Or forever. </strong> <br/> <br/> Let's think about your workplace and your culture within. Assume it's a stressful time - the winds of change are swirling about at tornadic speeds. There's little clarity in your role, and no clear vision has been communicated to the company at large. Everyone knows that it's a challenging time for the organization, and yet you're silently pulling for the good guys. You know they can do this. <br/> <br/> Then one day, finally, you get a message from company leadership. Yay! It's the clarity you've been waiting for! <br/> <br/> You read the message, and it says, \"Be positive.\" <br/> <br/> You sit there, perplexed. Your mind begins to swirl with that same tornadic speed as the winds of change. This is going to be our big change strategy? Everyone needs to be positive? <br/> <br/> <strong>  This is a problem because, when everyone is/acts positive, we... </strong></p><li> fake greatness</li><li> sweep the dirt under the rug</li><li> have no problems (right?) <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  When in reality, it's just a mask, just a cover-up. There's no... </strong></p><li> root cause analysis to understand the issues</li><li> addressing the root cause(s)</li><li> real clarity for the organization</li><li> vision to follow</li><li> leadership accountability <br/>  </li><p> It's all a sham. With hopes that \"positive will be the new black.\" After all, isn't that the goal? Employee happiness? So if you want to be happy, be happy - damnit!  <br/> <br/> There's a quote from Ralph Marston: Being positive in a negative situation is not naive. It's leadership. <br/> <br/> I get it. <br/> <br/> And I get that being negative is easier than being positive. Human nature has us focusing more on the negative, for whatever reason. Misery loves company, I suppose. <br/> <br/> But in a company with 1,000 employees, for example, I can guarantee you that less than 10% are true leadership material. And for the other 90%, being positive in a negative situation feels naive. For them, seeing leaders being positive in a negative situation feels a little phony, no? <br/> <br/> I'm reminded of the Titanic: the deck is clean, the rats are gone, and the band is still playing. Can't be all bad, right? <br/> <br/> So let me get to my point: \"Be positive\" is not a directive that facilitates or creates engagement. Being positive is not an employee engagement strategy, a leadership strategy, or a directive to drive culture change. Being positive without considering or acknowledging reality is dangerous. Ignoring reality doesn't make it go away. Positivity without reality can only yield a bad outcome. While it makes for a nicer, friendlier environment to be in - in a fake sort of way - I think it's shortsighted and ignores the obvious - that positive energy does not fix what ails you. <br/> <br/> <strong>  What we have here is a leadership problem. </strong> <br/> <br/> I'm reminded of this statement - \"We have a crisis in leadership in this country\" - that Bob Chapman (Chairman and CEO of Barry-Wehmiller) made in  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njn-lIEv1LU&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  his Tedx presentation </a> . Take a look at my  <a href=\"http://cxjourney.blogspot.com/2012/07/truly-human-leadership-everyone-matters.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  post about his talk </a> ; he says: \"7 out of 8 employees believe they work for a company that doesn't care for them.\" The reason: leadership and leadership's misguided focus. Looking at the scenario I describe above (tornadic winds), I believe the company doesn't care about its people. <br/> <br/> I think positivity is a good thing, has its time and place, and takes a real leader to (know how to) pull it off during hard times, but when employees know that the ship is sinking, telling them to \"be positive\" either makes them think that you're stupid or that you don't care about them. You pick. <br/> <br/> Don't pretend there are no issues. Or don't try to mask the fact that there are issues. Don't avoid the issues when asked about them. All of these are almost worse than having issues.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  What can be done? </strong></p><li> Uncover the root causes</li><li> Address the root causes</li><li> Solve the problems, eliminate the negative</li><li> Communication often</li><li> Communicate openly, candidly, and transparently</li><li> Communicate in a timely fashion</li><li> Communicate to get ahead of the curve and ahead of the negativity</li><li> Communicate with details, not with half details or teasers of what's to come</li><li> Communicate when you know something, when a concrete decision has been made</li><li> Make sure communication is meaningful</li><li> Provide clarity</li><li> Don't leave employees hanging</li><li> Be proactive</li><li> Answer employee questions about the situation in a meaningful way, not in a way that creates more angst</li><li> Ask employees for their feedback</li><li> Trust employees</li><li> Empower employees</li><li> Celebrate the good, the wins</li><li> Provide as much guidance as you can, but don't micromanage</li><li> Don't give employees a reason to focus on the negative </li><li> Give employees a reason to focus on the positive</li><li> Give them a positive (many positives) to focus on <br/>  </li><p> As you can see, communication is probably the most important tool you have in your toolbox to overcome some of the angst and anxiety that your staff is feeling. (I should add: meaningfulcommunication is key.) Keep the lines of communication open; allow it to flow both ways. Don't hide in the ivory tower. Give employees a reason not to focus on the negative. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Fix what ails you. And communicate while you're fixing it. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Financial Advisors who want to provide stellar service, accelerate or resume growth and preserve assets under management can take steps now to develop win-win relationships with their clients&rsquo; heirs.</p><p> A lot of advisors face a similar dilemma. As their practices have matured and their clientele has grown, their clients have matured too. As their clients retire, entering the distribution phase of life, many advisors have found it much more difficult to grow their practices.</p><p> Assets under management go into a slow, steady decline but the time necessary to generate new business is occupied by existing clients.</p><p> The decline in assets is exacerbated by the common practice among growing advisors of referring their younger, less affluent investors to junior advisors or investment management platforms that are better suited to younger investors&rsquo; more modest circumstances.</p><p> This idea looked great at the time. The advisor recognized that her more affluent clients had more complex requirements, so she chose to focus her time, attention and talent where it was most needed. Longer term, though, the outcome is a book of business that is heavily weighted with investors from the same wealth accumulating generation.</p><p> So what can you do?</p><p> <strong>  The most obvious answer is, of course, to establish a relationship with your clients&rsquo; kids and grandkids. Do this, and you have the next generation or two already predisposed to choose you as their advisor when the time comes for them to start investing on their own. </strong></p><p> But wait. Didn&rsquo;t I just say that it&rsquo;s hard for an advisor to serve their older, wealthier clients and bring on younger, less affluent clients?</p><p> Yeah, I did. But in the case of investors and their heirs, there are ways to solve this time crunch and keep every generation happy. Here&rsquo;s how&hellip;</p><p> Work with your client to engage their children early, when they&rsquo;re still in primary or secondary school. Encourage your client to include them at your next review. Spend some time telling the kids why mom and dad invest. Show them how you work with mom and dad to help them achieve their financial goals.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get into the details. Just introduce them to the importance of planning, diversification and discipline. Show them how you help their mom and dad. They&rsquo;ll see you as an important part of their parents&rsquo; lives and you&rsquo;ll win a place of high regard in their (and their parents&rsquo;) minds.</p><p> Work with your client to set the kids up with a small fund account (diversification). Get them used to seeing their statements and your regular client communications.</p><p> When they&rsquo;re ready to start investing for real, let them know that you will be asking a colleague to help with their account for now, but you&rsquo;ll always be on hand to answer questions.</p><p> Keep them on your mailing list. When the time comes, let them know that you are ready to serve them as you have their mom and dad.</p><p> Work with your client to engage, educate and prepare their young adult heirs</p><p> By the time they complete their educations, start work and are making their own investments, possibly with someone else, heirs are probably pretty curious about their parents&rsquo; finances and wonder what the implications for them will be.</p><p> Now is the perfect time to arrange for a family meeting. In this setting, you can educate the entire group about the plan to help with your clients&rsquo; retirement and estate. Discuss the clients&rsquo; Investment Policy. Show how the their financial plan and investment portfolio support the policy.</p><p> Feel free to include the clients&rsquo; estate attorney and other trusted partners in the discussion. AtD.A. Davidson, our trust company published a workbook titled &ldquo;What My Family Should Know&rdquo;, an invaluable instrument for discussing and recording important family matters like the whereabouts of assets and insurance, and the clients&rsquo; end of life wishes.</p><p> <strong>  The key here is to be a participant in the process. Don&rsquo;t just send the workbook to your clients. By organizing the discussion, you establish authority and credibility with the heirs. Let them see the wisdom and expertise you bring to their parents&rsquo; financial plan and its execution. </strong></p><p> At this stage in the heirs&rsquo; lives, they probably don&rsquo;t yet meet your account threshold. Make a decision about whether you have the capacity to add the relationship to your existing workload. If not, refer the heir to a less labor intensive platform. Again, keep them on your mailing list. Offer to be a resource whenever they have questions.</p><p> Work with your client to recruit the assistance and support of their mature heirs</p><p> Clients who have entered retirement may have children who are well into their saving and investing years. If these heirs are not investing with you, then attracting them will be difficult.</p><p> It makes sense. You know first hand how powerful the bond of trust is between an advisor and a client. Still, tens of thousands of investors a year switch advisors. An older heir might very well choose the advisor who served her parents so well!</p><p> <strong>  As above, meet with your client and the heirs to discuss their plan and investments, then broaden the conversation to include roles and responsibilities &ndash; living will requests, executors, trustees, beneficiaries and more. Demonstrate your command of the client&rsquo;s financial plan and your commitment to contributing to your client&rsquo;s well-being, and the ongoing well-being of her family. </strong></p><p> Want to win your clients&rsquo; kids&rsquo; business? Include your client&rsquo;s family in the conversation from the outset. By encouraging their involvement, you open critical lines of communication and provide a valuable education.</p><p> In a business based on relationships and trust, this strategy is sure to pay dividends.</p><p> How do you connect with your clients&rsquo; children? Do you consider the next generation in your business development activities? What systems or resources does your firm or custodian provide to help you manage relationships with heirs? If you choose to include beginner investors in your client base, how do you manage the time? </p> ",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://greatleadersserve.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark Miller  </u> </a></p><p> In his best-selling book, <a href=\"http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Power of Habit  </u> </a> , Charles Duhigg coined the term, &ldquo;keystone habits.&rdquo; These are habits, once formed, which have a positive ripple effect in our lives and in our organizations. It is an intriguing idea, to say the least. What habits, or routines would increase your chances of a fantastic 2015?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s go a little deeper to be sure we&rsquo;re on the same page regarding what keystone habits look like&hellip;</p><p> The habit of regular exercise is perhaps my favorite. The research is clear, people who develop the habit of exercise have positive affects beyond exercising &ndash; most notably, they are much more conscious about what they eat. A positive ripple for sure, if you want a higher level of fitness.</p><p> In the business world, Duhigg sites the case of Paul O&rsquo;Neill from Alcoa. When he became the CEO, rather than focus on share price or market share, he chose safety as his focus. He believed that focusing the entire enterprise on creating this single keystone habit would catapult the organization. He was correct.</p><p> So, what keystone habits would best serve you and your organization going into 2015? It is probably worth some time to consider. I&rsquo;ve included a few candidates below for both personal and organizational habits to help you start the conversation&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Personal Habits </strong></p><p> Think Others First - This has to be on my short list of keystone habits for leaders to consider. I wrote about this in my book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Leadership-Becoming-Leader-Business/dp/1609949609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420307145&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Heart+of+Leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Leadership-Becoming-Leader-Business/dp/1609949609/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420307145&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Heart+of+Leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Heart of Leadership  </a> </u> . Although thinking others first may not be our natural instinct, I believe it is the essential keystone habit for every leader. Until you and I cultivate the ability to think others first, our leadership will forever be limited.</p><p> Exercise - This may be one of the most obvious keystone habits for leaders to consider. The idea of being &ldquo;fit to lead&rdquo; is more than a clever book title, it is a prerequisite for maximum impact. In addition to giving us the stamina and energy required to lead well, a fit leader models for others his or her ability to lead themselves well. The more fit we are, the better we&rsquo;ll be able to lead.</p><p> Work from a clean desktop &ndash; I know for many of you this may seem bizarre. Here&rsquo;s my story&hellip; I attended a workshop on personal effectiveness more than 30 years ago. The instructor told us a study of highly successful leaders revealed only one trait in common: they worked from a clean desk &ndash; it sharpens focus and minimizes distractions. Don&rsquo;t knock it until you try it.</p><p> <strong>  Organizational Habits </strong></p><p> These are harder for me to suggest, because I don&rsquo;t know your organization. However, you can imagine the potential positive ripple effect if everyone in your organization formed the habit to&hellip;</p><li> Return phone calls from your customers within 24 hours.</li><li> Include community building activities on every meeting agenda.</li><li> Start every meeting with a review of the status of previous action items.</li><li> Memorize the names of all your employees and their family members.</li><li> Recognize the contribution of someone on your team weekly, or even daily!</li><li> Offer a personal welcome to every guest who enters your establishment.</li><li> Review safety data at every meeting&hellip; it worked for Alcoa.</li><p> Make no mistake our habits are key determinants of our success.</p><p> It was Aristotle who said: We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.</p><p> What keystone habits would have the greatest impact on your leadership in 2015?</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Developing your firm&rsquo;s response to a crisis: Targeting and Channels </strong></p><p> In the earlier posts in this series, I wrote about timing and message when it comes to developing crisis communications. In this post, we&rsquo;ll look at targeting and channels.</p><p> Just like we don&rsquo;t want to over-alarm clients with the message of the communication, we also want to take that approach with targeting. What I mean by that is&mdash;when at all possible&mdash;aim to communicate to those clients who are directly impacted by the incident or crisis. The best case is a list of impacted clients with a 100% confidence in accuracy and completeness. Unfortunately, in many cases, you won&rsquo;t have the exact data set&mdash;in that situation, better to err on being more inclusive than less. A couple of other considerations on targeting:</p><li> <strong>  Who are you required to communicate to? </strong> Depending on the nature of the crisis, there may be specific regulations and laws about who needs to receive the communication. For example, if it is a data incident, and only partial account or SSN numbers were compromised versus whole, you may have some flexibility (check with your legal and compliance folks!).</li><li> <strong>  Do you communicate to all names on the account? </strong> Your firm may already have some general &ldquo;rules&rdquo; set up about at what level you send your communications, for example, the primary client level (perhaps the first registered or main name on the account) or the account level (all names on the account). Keep in mind that if you mail at the account level, and your client has more than one account number, they may get multiple communications. <br/>  </li><p> When it comes to a decision about what communications channels you&rsquo;re going to use, again, part of that decision will be driven by the applicable regulations. In some situations, you&rsquo;ll need to demonstrate that a &ldquo;reasonable attempt&rdquo; was used to ensure that the impacted recipients received the communication. In general though, here are some channel considerations that I&rsquo;ve seen come up over the years:</p><li> <strong>  Social Media: </strong> Yes, you need to pay attention to this one. If something goes wrong (e.g. with client access, their ability to trade, or account reporting, etc.) there&rsquo;s a good chance that an angry client is going to take to the social media sphere. Having a response prepared is a good idea (especially when you need to make sure it is 140 characters long and pre-approved). Also, if the issue has large impact (the good majority of your client base) you may want to be proactive on your own social media channels.</li><li> <strong>  Your website: </strong> Don&rsquo;t forget your own website&mdash;you may want to post a message on the client login page or use any of your built in alert notifications or push notifications to mobile devices.</li><li> <strong>  Outbound Calls: </strong> Making an outbound call can be one of the best ways to communicate to a client about an incident or crisis. Obviously, this may only be possible when the impact is limited. But it can be very effective particularly in complex situations. A personal call also helps to further establish relationship, and build (or re-build, if needed) trust.</li><li> <strong>  Email: </strong> Using email is often the quickest way to get a message out to clients (assuming you have a clean email distribution list that is ready to go at a moment&rsquo;s notice). Good to keep in mind though that open rates will vary (some benchmarks indicate 20 &ndash; 35%). It is unlikely that you&rsquo;ll reach everyone you need to, which makes email a good companion to another channel, such as direct mail&mdash;you gain the immediacy of email, but also the assurance that sending a letter will improve the chances of readership. Oh, and remember that email can be forwarded. If you include something like a free credit monitoring offer code, it may make the rounds (same in the case of social media).</li><li> <strong>  Direct mail: </strong> Good old USPS. In some situations, you&rsquo;ll be required to send a physical letter to impacted clients. Even if a mailed letter isn&rsquo;t required, it still may be a good idea. Not all clients have email or online access, and the longer form that a letter can take can be helpful in complex situations that require more detail, and next steps for the clients. <br/>  </li><p> I hope this 3-part series has given you some food for thought in the realm of crisis communications, and how your company might respond when the need comes up. Of course, I&rsquo;m happy to help answer any questions, or discuss some of your specific communications planning needs.

    "title": "3 Retirement Planning Questions for Second Marriages",
    "link": "3-retirement-planning-questions-for-second-marriages",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> My parents were divorced when I was three. Both remarried within a few years. Both had two children in their new marriages. So, when asked if I come from a large family, how do I answer? Technically I am an only child, yet when the topic comes up, I am quick to say I have three brothers and a sister. I don't qualify them as halves. They don't feel like halves to me.</p><p> This is the complexity of our society. Second marriages and blended families are the norm. If you're in a second marriage yourself, here are three questions you need to ask &mdash; and answer &mdash; when it comes to your retirement planning within the context of your current marriage.</p><p> <strong>  Who gets what? </strong></p><p> Suppose you are my father and his wife, and you have been married since I was three. How shall you divide your savings among your two combined children and me? Some would say equally. I've also heard a proposal of fractions; 1/5 to me and 2/5 to each of the joint children. There is a part of me that is offended at the thought of being only 1/5, but the financial planner in me thinks that is just as fair a way to do it as anything else.</p><p> What if you have no mutual children, yet your spouse has one or two from a previous marriage? Do each of your respective IRAs go to each of your respective children? What about the assets you accumulate together?</p><p> This may sound like more of an estate planning matter than a retirement planning matter, but it is both. Many people tally up all their assets to estimate their retirement income &mdash; but if one passes early, and a huge chunk of assets bypasses the spouse, then what? The surviving spouse's retirement picture may look quite different than what was expected. Add in a large age differential in your second marriage, and it gets even more complex.</p><p> Smart financial planning software allows you to designate beneficiaries for each account and model out exactly what happens to the retirement income based on the longevity of each spouse. It's important to build a retirement plan that can hold up under numerous \"what if\" scenarios. To do this testing accurately you have to know where each asset goes upon the death of the account owner.</p><p> <strong>  Which accounts get used first? </strong></p><p> When you are in retirement you are taking withdrawals. A good retirement plan shows you which accounts to withdraw from first, then second, etc. I have numerous couples with a 10-year or larger age difference. In many cases we intentionally use the older spouse's IRA first for tax reasons (Roth conversions, reducing future required minimum distributions, etc.)</p><p> If you're going to use a lot of one person's assets first, or use joint assets to pay taxes on Roth conversions, you better also make sure you have your beneficiaries lined up. I've seen wives (and husbands) who planned to leave a specific account to their child, but when we projected it out, that account was slotted to be used in the next 10 years, and the child would be left with little. When you model this out, often the most efficient spend down strategy isn't the one that results in meeting your bequest goals.</p><p> In many of these situations, if eligible, life insurance is the best solution. (Note, I don't sell life insurance.) Sometimes it is a life insurance benefit to go to the current spouse; sometimes to the children. The advantage of an insurance solution: You can specify the amount you want your separate or combined children to receive, and then build the premiums into your retirement income plan to see how feasible it is.</p><p> <strong>  Who's in control? </strong></p><p> As I was writing this article, my go-to life insurance agent Jeff Carman stopped by my office and shared his own story. In his second marriage, his wife has one child from a previous marriage. He said he wanted to make sure his wife didn't leave all her assets in his possession. He's a good guy, but he said it simply isn't right that she should rely on him to carry out her wishes. If she passes early, and he gets everything, he is now in a position to disinherit her child.</p><p> His solution? He had her set up an irrevocable trust funded with life insurance. His wife is the donor and trustee. She deposits funds to the trust to pay the life insurance premiums. Her child is the beneficiary. If both his wife and her child predecease him, he is the contingent beneficiary. In these situations his preference is to fully fund the life insurance over the first 10 or 15 years. Then you know what the child is getting and as a couple you are free to enjoy the rest.</p><p> I often see the standard bypass/survivor trusts used, where the decedent's assets are put in a bypass trust and the surviving spouse can withdraw income and sometimes principal, and when the survivor passes the remainder goes to the children. In these situations the surviving spouse often remains in control. That may be a solution, but life insurance may be a better one.</p><p> The key with all of these questions is to be intentional about it. Second marriages and blended families add complexity to your retirement planning. It can be modeled out and structured in a way that works for your situation. You just have to take it one step at a time.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  In the near term, SNWAM has minimal municipal credit risk from falling crude oil prices </strong> .</p><p> Furthermore, we agree with the Federal Reserve that the U.S. economy as a whole will benefit from lower crude oil prices.

Well, the chart below is from Citigroup&rsquo;s commodity team.  It diagrams breakeven levels for various shale formations across the United States. We clearly see a jump after the $50 to $60 range per barrel of crude oil.  So $60bbl seems like a reasonable cutoff point to determine potential negative and positive impacts from falling crude oil prices. </p><p> <strong>  The winners going forward </strong> will be consumption related taxes, such as sales tax revenue, the California and Texas economies, and perhaps also highway user fund revenues.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  The loser </strong> from $60bbl is Alaska, and we have a neutral outlook for North Dakota and Colorado.  In the coming weeks, look for more details and background on major shifts in U.S. oil production and how those shift will impact specific municipal credits.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2_2.png\" width=\"752\"/></p><p>  </p><p> Sources: SNWAM Research, Citigroup, Business Insider, U.S. BEA</p>",

    "link": "10-indisputable-reasons-communities-are-the-center-of-our-lives",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on DNN's blog page.</p><p> <strong>  1) Family </strong></p><p> As we exit the womb and enter the world, we&rsquo;re welcomed by our first community: our family. It starts with our parents and extends to grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. Down the road, a sibling or two may enter the fray. Our childhood is a series of &ldquo;community events&rdquo; and community rituals: gathering at the dinner table, elementary school graduation, grandparents&rsquo; fiftieth anniversary and so on.</p><p> <strong>  2) Work </strong></p><p> In a traditional office setting, our work community is the colleagues we see in the office every day. The community extends to remote offices, partners and clients. For some, the &ldquo;work community&rdquo; is a key reason for taking a job. For those who are self-employed (i.e. and work from home), there&rsquo;s still a community of clients (note: the self-employed might have a few pets that sit to the side (or on top) of their desks).</p><p> <strong>  3) Professional Associations </strong></p><p> To quote the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE), &ldquo;A sense of community coordination is at the heart of the association profession.&rdquo; According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.asaecenter.org/Advocacy/contentASAEOnly.cfm?ItemNumber=16341\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   their website  </a> </u> , ASAE estimates that over 90,000 professional associations exist in the United States. Here in the Bay Area, I belong to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://svpma.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Silicon Valley Product Management Association  </a> </u> , which holds a meeting every month.</p><p> <strong>  4) Sports Teams </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mickey-mantle.PNG\" width=\"640\"/></p><p> I root for a mix of Bay Area and New York teams: the Sharks (NHL), Warriors (NBA), Yankees (MLB) and Giants (NFL). Every professional sports team includes a rabid community of fans. We gather at arenas and we gather online. Sometimes, we call in to sports radio stations after the game. We share a strong common bond.</p><p> <strong>  5) Neighborhoods </strong></p><p> The house we purchase or the apartment we rent comes attached with a community: the neighborhood. I&rsquo;ll check in on a neighbor&rsquo;s house when they&rsquo;re out of town and catch up with them at a Labor Day block party. Our neighborhood uses  <u>  <a href=\"http://nextdoor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nextdoor  </a> </u> , an online community platform. In our Nextdoor community, we converse about school events, list items for sale (or for free) and ask about plumbers and accountants.</p><p> <strong>  6) Circles of Friends </strong></p><p> We build and establish friendships through all works of life: school, work, play, etc. When we go out and have fun, we&rsquo;ll invite a number of friends along. Sometimes, we&rsquo;re the single common bond among these &ldquo;friends.&rdquo; We introduce them to one another. In that way, we serve to forge new connections among people, like any good community manager would do.</p><p> <strong>  7) TV Shows </strong></p><p> <strong>  <img alt=\"\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/house-of-card.PNG\" width=\"640\"/> </strong></p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s 60 Minutes or House of Cards, we all have a favorite TV show (or series). Some lend themselves more to passionate communities (of fans) than others. My favorite series include Chicago Fire and The Americans. If I get a chance to catch a program &ldquo;live&rdquo; (in prime time), I&rsquo;ll peek on Twitter to see what viewers are talking about. There&rsquo;s also a service called  <u>  <a href=\"http://tvtag.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tvtag  </a> </u>  (formerly called GetGlue). Services like these help build stronger bonds within a given community.</p><p> <strong>  8) Alumni Groups </strong></p><p> My alma mater has an alumni magazine. I receive the magazine a few times a year, along with separate mailings that urge me to donate to the university. Regionally, my alma mater has a Bay Area alumni group with a corresponding Facebook Group. There are events scheduled every few months.</p><p> I recently discovered a Facebook Group for my high school graduating class. It was fascinating to see familiar names and faces there. For past jobs I&rsquo;ve worked at, I find numerous alumni groups on LinkedIn, where we can keep in touch.</p><p> <strong>  9) Parenting Groups </strong></p><p> Those of us with kids know how parenting can serve as a strong bond (with other parents). Parents of newborns will gather to talk about the shared experience of raising a baby. In elementary school, parents willvolunteer on the PTA, as well as at school events and fundraisers. As our kids graduate to a new school, we&rsquo;ll meet new parents and make new friends.</p><p> <strong>  10) Politics </strong></p><p> Some of us are far more passionate about politics than others (I consider myself less passionate). Regardless, we associate with communities. In the U.S., we might align with the Democratic or Republican parties. We might declare ourselves independents. Or we might align ourselves with the Tea Party movement.</p><p> <strong>  Conclusion </strong></p><p> If you work in online communities, take a step back from time to time and think about life in general. As you leave the office (or go offline), you&rsquo;ll begin to see all the amazing communities that form the center of our lives. Go be a great community manager. Of life!</p>",

    "title": "Can a Retirement Gap Analysis Save You?",
    "link": "can-a-retirement-gap-analysis-save-you",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> A retirement gap analysis shows if you are on track to having enough to retire on your terms. It does the same for your employees. Often retirement planning is expressed in a non-personal way. Unfamiliar terms like savings rates and QDIA are used and we wonder why more people are not engaged in planning for their future retirement. A personalized gap analysis delivered by someone caring who is also versed in retirement planning makes things tangible.</p><p> <strong>  What is a retirement gap analysis? </strong></p><p> In general, a gap analysis looks at the difference between where you are and where you want to be. If a gap is detected, what are the options for filling the gap? A retirement gap analysis looks at assumptions like when you would like to retire, assumptions regarding inflation rates (the rising cost of living over time), and your comfort with the trade-off between risk and return when investing your money. Assumptions around the income you will receive from Social Security and any pensions you might receive reduce the needed income from outside investments. Using those assumptions, options can be provided regarding saving more, taking on more investment risk and potentially pushing back the retirement date.</p><p> For the uninitiated this can be pretty intimidating. That&rsquo;s why I feel it&rsquo;s important that the retirement gap analysis be delivered by not simply a financial advisor or enrollment specialist, but a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; professional or similar credential that can empathize, sympathize and personalize.</p><p> <strong>  Gap analysis and tax savings </strong></p><p> All things equal, it&rsquo;s better to save in a way that reduces taxes, sometimes referred to as tax deferred. Simply put, save and invest now, let it grow and pay your taxes later. Some of your employees may not know that interest and growth on your savings that is less than a year old is taxed at their highest marginal rate, currently 39.6%. That means for every dollar earned, they keep about 60 cents. If they save in a tax-deferred retirement account, like an IRA or 401(k), they can avoid paying taxes until sometime after your 70 &frac12;. That deferral benefit also accrues to the returns made on that money. If you are savvier, you know that you pay as much as 20% on interest and other earnings on your money held more than a year. Let&rsquo;s look at this in practice.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say that you are a business owner or highly compensated employee that makes $175,000 salary. Further, let&rsquo;s say that your retirement gap analysis shows that you need to save $20,000 to retire on your terms. The 401(k) allows you to save $17,500 given that your plan meets the overall testing requirements for equality of savings. If you are over 50 years old, the 401(k) plan allows you to save the additional $2500 to help you &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; your savings (a maximum of $5500 in 2015). Best of all your employees have the same benefit. Many people aren&rsquo;t saving because they have no idea how much they need to save and no one has made it personal. That&rsquo;s where offering all employees retirement gap analysis benefits not only them but your ability to save as well. If you are the business owner. You also have the ability to add a profit sharing contribution that could ratchet your savings up to $54,000 (maximum in 2015). There are many profit-sharing savings formulas you might be able to use to create an equitable distribution. You may read our blog to get more information.</p><p> An IRA significantly reduces the savings ability. It limits savings to $5500 plus thousand dollars in retirement catch-up contributions. I find many employers that don&rsquo;t really grasp the benefit they truly offer their employees.</p><p> <strong>  Retirement gap analysis and your future </strong></p><p> The greatest saving of retirement gap analysis is not running out of money in retirement. If you&rsquo;re like most people you would not want to run out of money at any time in your life, much less during your retirement. Saving early in life and seeking consistent investment returns needed is a key to adequate funding without hyper savings later on. Many states like Illinois have run into pension funding problems because their investment returns did not meet expectations. Some of those expectations likely should&rsquo;ve been tempered and a more conservative estimate used. Wisconsin used a more conservative estimate and has found themselves in a much better funding status.</p><p> Organizations that had pensions which use actuaries did not apply this same actuarial science for their employees when they switched to a defined contribution or 401(k) plan. While many employees don&rsquo;t see saving into their pension as optional, many see the 401(k) as an option fulfilling a need that seems far off in the distance. It&rsquo;s often difficult to see the future unless one makes it more tangible by using tools such as a retirement gap analysis.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s assume that one day you find little need for your 401K savings because of other income sources. Eventually the government requires you to begin spending the money out of that account known as required minimum distributions. The government also allows for a portion of that to be given to charity tax-free. A great way to save money on taxes and direct your money to causes dear to you.</p><p> <strong>  What can a retirement gap analysis do for you and your employees </strong></p><p> There are many implementations of a gap analysis we could use based upon your plan&rsquo;s needs. One example is the use of a  <u>  risk comfort assessment </u> . It starts the retirement gap analysis conversation by assessing an individual&rsquo;s natural comfort with taking on market risk to get a desired return. You&rsquo;re welcome to take  <u>  <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/clients/index/908488\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the assessment  </a> </u>  to see where you stand and how this might be used to help guide the development of retirement gap analysis for you and potentially your employees. Other implementations allow for reporting back to you on how well each demographic group is doing and various actionable metrics. Given that you have other service providers in place, this can be a service that can be added without disrupting the rest of your program.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Life is about risks. </strong></p><p> However, it is important to know that all risks are not created the same.</p><p> Sure, you take a risk with that new job, buying a new house, or speeding down the highway to get to work on time. If you reflected on the risks you took with each of those life journeys, is the risk the same? My answer to you is, yes. And I absolutely mean it.</p><p> See, when I look at taking a new job, buying a house, or speeding down the highway, there is risk built into each of these things; however, I see it as normal risk. Meaning, it is a little scary and I have already given consideration of the outcomes and know I should be OK if everything remains constant:</p><li> I make more money and I am able to  meet the expectations of the new job</li><li> I remain employed and can make the mortgage payment</li><li> I speed down the highway, it&rsquo;s a 50/50 chance I will get caught, but if I do then I can pay the ticket</li><p> I consider these types of actions normalcies in life. Regardless of economics or demographics, we all face these normal types of risks. They might be a little different for others, but we each face them day-to-day.</p><p> <strong>  So, what isn&rsquo;t a normal risk then? </strong></p><p> Have you ever been in a situation where regardless of all things you factor in &ndash; positives, negatives, consequences, or outcomes &ndash; you still aren&rsquo;t sure? Now throw on top of that feelings of fear, anguish, excitement, elation. These are those situations that are beyond normal risk.</p><p> Ever drop $50,000 cash to buy into a startup? What about quit your job to start up a consultancy with no clients? How about buy a flip house, but you know nothing about flipping houses? Or take on a project at work with no working knowledge to lead it or make it successful?</p><p> All of these situations take risks on the unknown where you cannot always foresee how it will end up. And these are situations as I see it where people either step up or step out. Just like there are born leaders, there are born risk takers.</p><p> And people who are successful in taking risks know it requires pushing others out of the way. I might get some flack saying that, but high risks mean pushing others out of the way to drive the desired outcome. The example I utilize to make this point is driving on the highway.</p><p> Regardless if it is a two-lane or six-lane highway, we all know the fast lane is made for those people who are passing or in most cases, speeding. The people speeding many times are speeding beyond the point of normal risk.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s just say on a 65 mph city stretch, they are going 80+ mph. You&rsquo;re cruising down the highway in the fast lane with the other speeders and all of a sudden you have to slow down or in some cases stop. But, the slow lane continues to move forward (I don&rsquo;t know about you, but this drives me absolutely crazy!).</p><p> When you finally start moving again, it is still slow so you decide to move to the slow lane to get ahead. When you finally get far enough, you realize there is one person who decided to get in the fast lane, but actually drive the speed limit. I consider these type of drivers those who take normal risks, but thought today they wanted to take a high risk and get in the fast lane. It isn&rsquo;t until a high risk taker forces the normal risk taker back over to the slow lane, that all the other high risk takers can move forward again.</p><p> <strong>  Life unfortunately is a lot like this. </strong></p><p> There are people who think they can take high risks, but really they are just in the way. It isn&rsquo;t that these people are bad, but rather these people do well ensuring the day-to-day gets accomplished. No more, no less.</p><p> If you are a person who one might consider a high risk taker or are put into a situation where you become a high risk taker, it is important to keep some things in mind (as I have learned through those opportunities and projects of high risk):</p><li> Pushing others out of the way is crucial sometimes, but remember to do it professionally and keep in mind these people are still getting the day-to-day tasks completed</li><li> Gather feedback along the way to understand your impact &ndash; this includes honest, open self-reflection</li><li> Be nimble &ndash; know how to react quickly, but with knowledge consideration of past, current, and future</li><li> Anticipate roadblocks and have alternate plans to continue forward</li><li> Share knowledge appropriately</li><li> Mentor others along the way</li><li> Celebrate the success</li><p> So, the next time you are out on the road, keep in mind what kind of risk taker you are being for the day if you are holding up the fast lane</p>",

    "content": "<p> At one time or another, we all of feel stuck. We&rsquo;re in one place and we&rsquo;d like to be in another. Whether that place is a different career, a different partner, or simply in a warmer climate, we all fantasize about the possibilities of what life could like if only things were different.</p><p> For the majority, that dream is where it ends.</p><p> For a smaller group, that dream makes them more unhappy about their current state.</p><p> For an even smaller group, that dream is what fuels them to create change.</p><p> <strong>  SO WHAT MAKES SOME OF US WALLOW WHILE OTHERS TAKE ACTION? </strong></p><p> It isn&rsquo;t about time management, fears, or an IV drip of coffee. It&rsquo;s about reframing how you look at it.  Here&rsquo;s the simple, key difference:</p><p> When we are pissed that things don&rsquo;t look the way we want, we tend to focus on &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</p><li> Why aren&rsquo;t I getting paid more?</li><li> Why isn&rsquo;t my partner helping out around the house?</li><li> Why can&rsquo;t my dog do anything remotely like those dogs I see on Youtube?</li><p> It seems reasonable. Knowing &ldquo;why&rdquo; sounds like a great way to get to the underlying cause and then fix it. But, as anyone who&rsquo;s spiraled into the vortex of &ldquo;why&rdquo; knows, it keeps you stuck. It focuses on blame. And, it rarely changes anything.</p><p> So, I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to your new alternative.</p><p> It&rsquo;s proactive.</p><p> It&rsquo;s tactical.</p><p> It&rsquo;s empowering.</p><p> It&rsquo;s &ldquo;how.&rdquo;</p><li> How can I create opportunities to bring in more money?</li><li> How can I get my partner to help out around the house?</li><li> How can I train my dog to do more than eat my shoes and lick himself?</li><p> &ldquo;How&rdquo; gives us the ability to look at the role we play in creating our situation. Sure, I&rsquo;d much rather blame everyone else, but that only gets me so far. Until you ask yourself &ldquo;How have I created this situation?&rdquo; you&rsquo;re likely to remain in the same place.</p><p> <strong>  THE OUTCOME: </strong></p><p> You change your behavior. You try something new. You let go of people, places, and things that no longer align with what you truly want.</p><p> <strong>  MY CHALLENGE TO YOU: </strong></p><p> Look at how you&rsquo;ve contributed to the situation. Then, change what doesn&rsquo;t work for you. Yes, it&rsquo;s that simple. </p><p> How will this shift help you?</p>",

This takes dedication and commitment to the numbers game.  Your end result makes it worthwhile.</p><p> <strong>  Elimination </strong></p><p> Some job applications ask for information that indicates your age such as the year you graduated from school.  You have to decide whether it&rsquo;s worthwhile answering.  Others make the application redundant asking you to fill out your employment history when in fact they also ask for an attached resume.  This may be a signal the company is highly bureaucratic.</p><p> Prospective clients sometimes make unreasonable demands or will treat you rudely.  Life is too short, I recommend walking away or you look desperate and the situation will decline further. </p><p> <strong>  Personal </strong></p><p> Begin your client conversation on a personal note in a relaxed fashion as if you were speaking to a friend.  Find areas of commonality and speak to these.  Then learn why you were invited in for the appointment.  Your conversation will be far more fruitful. </p><p> <strong>  Golden Rule of Sales </strong></p><p> Do you have a hobby you enjoy?  If so, no one needs to motivate you to spend time on it, you look forward to it.  The same is true with finding a good job or the better client.  An element of likeability between all parties should be present in order to put your best foot forward and make a favorable impression.  When this occurs, you are almost assured the job or the sale.  </p><p> <strong>  Assume the Sale </strong></p><p> Although assumptions during conversation should never be made, when you strive to build relationships and properly earn the sale, you will increase your odds for success.  The only remaining question for you to ask for the job is, &ldquo;When would you like me to start?&rdquo;  For clients ask, &ldquo;When would you like to get started?&rdquo;</p><p> Following these guidelines should lead to the  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/contactme/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Smooth Sale  </u>  ! </a></p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;d much rather take over a team with results in the toilet than one executing on all cylinders. Sure they&rsquo;ll be some long days and sleepless nights, but there&rsquo;s nothing better than the electric feeling your team experiences when they accomplished what no one (particularly them) thought could be done. Inspire results like that, and your &ldquo;A&rdquo; players will follow you anywhere, and you get to do it all again.</p><p> <strong>  Approach 1: Redefine the Problem </strong></p><p> At Verizon, my biggest turnaround successes came in jobs where I had the least expertise. Ironically, we didn&rsquo;t succeed IN SPITE of my lack of technical knowledge, but BECAUSE of it.</p><p> Perhaps you&rsquo;ve been there (or are here). You&rsquo;re so entrenched in solving a big hairy problem, all your energy goes to solving that issue. The brainstorming and action planning leads to only incremental improvement.</p><p> On the other hand, when you have no freaking clue what to do to fix the problem, you begin looking for problems you DO know how to solve. When the results really suck, and everything&rsquo;s been tried, solving the problem from a different angle is often just what will change the game.</p><p> <strong>  Approach 2: Redefine Markets </strong></p><p> When I took over responsibility for 100 or so Verizon Wireless stores our biggest problem was a saturated market. Everyone had a cell phone. It was all about &ldquo;switchers&rdquo; from other carriers.</p><p> I encouraged my team to redefine the problem. We didn&rsquo;t need more retail customers, we needed to convert the small business customers that were already coming into our stores to manage their personal accounts. Look for muddy boots (contractors), ask every customer where they work (&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m self-employed&rdquo;) and we often found they had their business accounts elsewhere. Now we were switching not one line, but five or ten at a time. We quickly led the nation in small business sales which went from 1% to 20% of our revenue mix. Other regions came scrambling to understand our approach.</p><p> <strong>  Approach 3: Redefine Assumptions </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m embarrassed to admit that when I was tapped to transform our customer outsourcing channel, I didn&rsquo;t even know that we outsourced calls. I was told the problem was, &ldquo;How do we hold our outsourcers accountable?&rdquo; But as I dug further, I was sure that the current approach was the cause of many contentious and frustrating relationships with mediocre results.</p><p> When we redefined the problem as &ldquo;How do we get our strategic partners (we stopped calling them &ldquo;outsourcers&rdquo;) to care as much about our customers as we do?&rdquo; the entire strategy changed. We worked on  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/trusted-strategic-partnerships/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   culture, training and understanding  </u>  . </a>  We treated human beings as human beings, not outsourced gadgets. We reached parity with internal centers.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re really stuck and your results really suck, back away, and try redefining the problem. Ask some naive people to take a look. Perhaps you&rsquo;re solving the wrong problem.</p>",

The food was incredibly fresh and the landscape varied from mountains and rain forests to  jungles and beaches.</p><p> While there, I was captivated by the wonders of the Inca civilization, including the ruins of Machu Picchu.  Hiking, (and walking!), around this iconic Inca settlement, I was consistently amazed at the strategic planning and implementation that comprised the construction of this site.</p><p> Thousands of years ago, the Incas had a vision of how to not just survive but thrive as a culture.

Don&rsquo;t hide behind someone else.  Speak up.  Take a stand.  Clearly articulate what is important to you.  State your values.  People want to hear from you.  Don&rsquo;t waste another second.

    "content": "<p> Most businesses that lack the structure of a large corporation find it difficult to take a marketing idea from conception to results. More often than not, we see marketing strategies stopping and starting, stopping after the strategies begins to work, or never starting at all. It may seem ridiculous that this occurs on such a regular basis, but it is really what we see happen over and over again.   <br/> <br/> One high performing financial advisor told me that he will always be successful in his industry because he executes on the ideas that his peers just talk about. And although not every marketing activity has worked for him (like that one seminar where no one showed up, but he did the presentation anyhow), most have significant results and keep getting better (like his once-a-week strategic alliance lunch campaign). If you look around, there&rsquo;s no shortage of ideas for how to gain new business. In fact, many people will tell you exactly what they did to achieve success. You just have to choose an idea you want and implement it. <br/> <br/> If you have a commitment to net new business, you also need a similar commitment to consistent implementation of your marketing efforts. It turns out that the most difficult marketing effort is the one that gets implemented fully. AND it turns out it is also the one that produces far more results!</p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  I say NO&hellip; it&rsquo;s evolving. </strong> The social landscape continues to shift, and Twitter is no exception. However, it&rsquo;s still one of my favorite social platforms for several reasons:</p><li> It keeps me &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; with up to the minute new</li><li> For &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; people like me, the short format makes it easy to connect on the fly</li><li> I love the lists and stream</li><li> Most importantly it allows me, and brands I work with, to reach out and touch people&hellip; engage, interact and build relationships, at scale, with ease. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Twitter&rsquo;s reach goes way beyond Twitter </strong> , beyond its signed-up users, and touches many more than its reach numbers demonstrate. In fact, a recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-12/twitter-ceo-unveils-instant-timeline-to-attract-new-users.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bloomberg tech article  </a> </u>  stated that Twitter&rsquo;s CEO, Dick Costolo, reported at the company&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Analysts Day&rdquo; that 500 million people access Twitter to check out profiles or tweets each month without logging in.</p><p> <strong>  Sure, it has slower user growth numbers than Facebook </strong> , but it&rsquo;s really a different medium for a different audience. I don&rsquo;t think you can lump them in the same basket. In fact, Tweets and Hashtags are posted in every form of media, and every TV show&mdash;something that doesn&rsquo;t apply to Facebook. It&rsquo;s the ultimate media outlet for breaking and real-time news. In my opinion it has become the &ldquo;global town square,&rdquo; yet people don&rsquo;t need to be in the town square to hear its clamoring. With over 500 million tweets a day, news and conversation emanating from Twitter finds its way into daily conversations of the masses on an immense scale.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s a listening tool. </strong> It&rsquo;s a conversation tool. It&rsquo;s a connection and sharing tool. One can find a path into most communities via Twitter. In fact, smart brands should think of Twitter as the Swiss army knife of social. And if the rumblings from the company&rsquo;s executives are any indication, the platform is slated to make it even easier for people to connect, organize their timelines and share content. I&rsquo;m a bit excited to learn about the new things coming next year, including the ability to take, edit and share video in real time, and to share public tweets through private messages.</p><p> One of its greatest features, however, is still the Twitter list, yet many don&rsquo;t take full advantage of it. In fact, I came across a  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/twitter-lists\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog post by Buffer  </a> </u>  last month that lists 23 ideas for using Twitter lists. You should check it out. No doubt about it, <strong>  the power of a great Twitter list is immeasurable! </strong></p><p> In just a few short years, Twitter has had a huge impact on our lives, from breaking news to influencing language and conversation. People are even talking in Hashtags (check out this hilarious Jimmy Fallon/Justin Timberlake <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   video  </u> </a> &hellip;), and use of the Twitter-born symbol has spread to many other social channels, and has great impact and power on Instagram. Do I think it will continue to have the same impact? Much depends on how the platform does or does not meet the expectations of its users. The one thing we can count on in the ever-shifting social landscape is change, so time will tell. However, I think the more important question is&mdash;how adept are we as individuals and brands in using social tools like Twitter to make connections and build relationships? The tools that continue to fill our needs in achieving  <u>  <a href=\"http://webdefence.global.blackspider.com/urlwrap/?q=AXicY3Rn8FrCwHB9AQNDUU6liWWKXnFRmV5uYmZOcn5eSVF-jl5yfi5DsZOXh0uxR5mBsYGFhRmDr1N-ZWqRQ3EKRDajpKTASl-_vLxcryi1pLQoLz-vKDUnsSQzP684I7MApEbfviAxPTU-M8XW0IQBAgC4oyeR&amp;Z\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Return on Reationship (#RonR)  </a> </u>  are the ones that will stick around.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Investors under the age of 40 present a huge opportunity to advisors. The next generation represents a larger population than the Baby Boomer clan who came before them. Studies show they are not satisfied with the financial advice they are receiving. To ensure your firm will remain relevant to these young investors, your attention and ability to adapt to their preferences and expectations are crucial.</p><p> As aging clients transfer their wealth to the next of kin, firms are struggling to retain those assets. Your clients&rsquo; children have a mindset of their own, and that includes freedom to choose a new advisor. Research shows a very small percentage, just 2% to 15%, of clients&rsquo; children will retain the financial advisor their parents use.  </p><p> The statistic is alarming; what you have seen as your usual revenue source is going to change. Advisory firms need to pinpoint a strategy that will balance serving existing clients with another strategy to connect with young investors or face the chance of losing a large portion of assets.</p><p> <strong>  THE MYTH OF THE BROKE MILLENNIAL </strong></p><p> Many advisors are shying away from creating formal plans to reach out to the up and coming generation of investors; assuming that the assets will stay within their firm. Other advisors feel that the next generation controls such a small portion of the country&rsquo;s wealth, so why bother now. These young investors may not have a pocket full of cash to invest with you now, but the transfer of wealth will take place and it will happen quickly.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1_1.png\" width=\"958\"/></p><p> <strong>  Advisors must pay close attention - this is your opportunity: </strong></p><li> $23 trillion dollars will transfer from Boomers to their children within eight years **</li><li> 71% of Millennials are investing, but just 21% are connected to a financial advisor **</li><li> Millennial women will earn more than Millennial men ***</li><li> Millennials will outpace Baby Boomer earnings by 2018 ***</li><li> Millennials will have $2.5 trillion in spending power by 2018 ***</li><li> 74% of Millennials say they influence the purchase decisions of other generations *** <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  THE FUTURE OF YOUR FIRM </strong></p><p> Based on the facts, the question you need to ask yourself now is, &ldquo;Where do you see your firm in five or ten years?&rdquo; Your business plan will need to keep pace with your projections and reflect new strategies that will maintain and grow your assets that are different from the strategies you have in place to target Boomers.</p><p> Current tactics won&rsquo;t work with the next generation. Your firm needs to evolve with change, rather than expecting up and coming investors to revert to your outdated methods.   </p><p> <strong>  DO YOU REALLY KNOW THE NEXT GENERATION? </strong></p><p> Sure, you probably know a few young investors; maybe you have met a few of your clients&rsquo; children. Many of you have developed some of your own opinions of the group, knowing they are often referred to as self-centered, narcissists, and trophy kids.</p><p> Despite the stereotypes, your firm needs attract them, capture their wealth, and serve them. Here&rsquo;s a few traits that are good for you to know before developing your strategy.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-20-at-7.10.38-AM.png\" width=\"970\"/></p><p> <strong>  \"It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.\" &ndash; Charles Darwin </strong></p><p> <strong>  THE EVOLVING ROLE OF MARKETING, SALES, AND SERVICE </strong></p><p> Engaging with the younger crowd is not an easy thing to do. It will take time and effort on your part and firms that start now stand to outperform firms that don&rsquo;t. Communication methods will play a key role in grabbing their attention.</p><p> <strong>  Your firm will need to create a communication plan based on methods that the next generation prefers and expects versus methods that are easiest for your firm. </strong></p><p> The role of your marketing department has and will continue to be under an enormous amount of pressure to change. Marketing efforts need to evolve from &ldquo;batch-and-blast&rdquo; methods to strategies that develop client intimacy and long-term client engagement. </p><p> The next generation relies on social media to provide a constant feed of news and advice. They are receptive to infographics and social media posts. Nobody wants a marketing call; this generation will be more than irritated by old-school marketing methods that were once welcomed by their parents.</p><p> An <u>  annual report </u> by Edelman found that 82% of Millennials say they have more faith in a company that is involved with social media. This generation will not be impressed that you have a website, they expect it. They also expect that their financial advisor be present and active on social media; providing them with advice and guidance as they journey through notable life-stages.</p><p> Evolution doesn&rsquo;t stop with your marketing department. Sales and services teams will need to advance from being information providers to helping clients weed through the vast amount of data they have collected on their own.</p><p> <strong>  6 ACTIONS YOU SHOULD IMPLEMENT NOW </strong></p><p> Next-Gen investors like autonomy. They want to have a say in their financial plan, but value the advice of an advisor. Your business model and processes will need to reflect that you understand their unique perspective; they want to retire comfortably, but they place a high degree of importance on living well now.  </p><p> Unlike the boomers who are engaged by formal communication and printed financial plans, young investors like electronic forms and online meetings. Don&rsquo;t give a Next-Gen investor a printed brochure. Your &ldquo;brochure&rdquo; needs to be available online and communicates precisely what you do and how you add value.  </p><li> <strong>  Provide Immediate and Accessible Information: </strong> Next-Gen investors will find the information they are looking for. YOU need to be the one providing it.</li><li> <strong>  Be Present: </strong> Put yourself in front of Next-Gen clients. Create social media profiles and post blogs, videos, podcasts, and other tidbits of helpful information. You can start small with social media, just be sure to do it.</li><li> <strong>  Master a Variety of Communication Channels: </strong> Remember, young investors prefer informal communication. You need to engage with this audience through texting, online meetings, Skype, and smart phone applications. Offer clients an option of meeting choices; online or in-person. They are much more likely to connect with you online first and then in-person once trust is established.</li><li> <strong>  Expand Service Offerings: </strong> Overconfidence and required minimum account balances have stifled advisors from reaching out to Next-Gen investors. Offer a wide range of services and products to meet various investment levels and stages of entry points. Firms will need to provide more for less.  </li><li> <strong>  Become Tech Savvy: </strong> To land the assets of the next generation, the future of your firm will depend on your ability to be proactive and provide 24/7 service through online access including mobile devices. The Next-Gen likes DIY (do it yourself) options, but they will look to you for collaboration and validation when making investment decisions.</li><li> <strong>  Educational Sessions: </strong>  Reach out to younger investors through their parents. Be available to help with college transition, inheritances, succession planning, and family legacy plans. Advisory firms who start to build relationships now with new investors will help secure the future success of their practice. <br/>  </li><p> By providing value to young investors, they will continue to seek your expertise and advice. Consider adding junior or associate advisors to your team to attract new clients.</p><p> Embrace the change. The technology needed to attract future investors is more efficient and will reduce your costs; which in turn boosts your bottom line. You have to place focus on what will sustain the future of your practice.</p><p> <strong>  \"Wisdom is knowing what to do next, virtue is doing it.\" - David Starr Jordan </strong></p>**<u> Connecting Across the Ages: A Guide to Four Generations of Clients</u><br/>***Edelman Insights 8095 Report.

    "content": "<p> Written by: Laura Coletti | <a href=\"http://www.blissintegrated.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bliss Integrated Communication  </u> </a>  </p><p> Growing up as a competitive athlete, I had my fair share of good and bad coaches. I often found that a coach&rsquo;s leadership capabilities were reflected in the team&rsquo;s success. However, I never stopped to consider what qualities inspired action.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> This is the resounding message in leadership expert Simon Sinek&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en#t-5614\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>      </u> </a> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en#t-5614\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TEDTalk  </a> </u> , &ldquo;How Great Leaders Inspire Action.&rdquo; I buy it. Ultimately, the idea or product itself often has very little to do with why any leader, past or present, has generated a mass following. To me, being a great leader takes more than just selling an idea, this is merely a foundation on which to build strong leadership skills. There are several other qualities I consider essential for inspiring action.</p><p> <strong>  1. The Ability to Create Loyalty </strong></p><p> In his talk, Sinek describes how the goal of any leader should be to establish relationships with people who believe in the same ideas and goals. Just as important, however, is maintaining and growing those relationships in order to develop trust. In addition, the best companies, teams and organizations have a low rate of turnover because their leaders have the ability to instill loyalty.</p><p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://archive.org/stream/philosophyloyal00roycuoft/philosophyloyal00roycuoft_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Philosophy of Loyalty  </a> </u> , the late Harvard professor Josiah Royce explains how loyalty is created by making a cause personal, at least in part, to those working towards its achievement. Leaders who are committed to long-term success and have earned the trust of those whom they are guiding are better able to inspire action.</p><p> <strong>  2. Knowing One&rsquo;s Talent </strong></p><p> Leaders who foster success are aware of the individual strengths and weaknesses that each team member brings to the table. He or she knows how to guide each individual to the highest level of performance. This, in turn, helps to maximize the overall benefit each team player provides to the greater group. This type of leader recognizes that the same approach that inspires action from some people may not motivate others. Mike Krzyzewski,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-leadership/post/coach-ks-leadership-abcs/2011/04/01/gIQAkIpPUN_blog.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the winningest coach in the history of NCAA Division 1 Men&rsquo;s Basketball  </a> </u> , is one of the best examples of an effective leader who understands this concept. In a 2011  <u>  interview </u> , this coach described how he adjusts his system year-by-year to cater to the new players on his roster. He focuses on leveraging each individual player&rsquo;s strengths, and his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=152844\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   results  </a> </u>  speak for themselves.</p><p> <strong>  3. Communicating Effectively </strong></p><p> Without effective communication tactics, aspiring leaders will be hard-pressed to inspire action in others. Sinek encourages leaders to take a communications approach that begins with defining the &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind an idea. He calls this an inside-out approach; most people who are trying to sell an idea begin with &lsquo;what,&rsquo; and by the time they&rsquo;ve gotten to the &lsquo;why,&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve lost their audience. Sinek points to companies like Apple as good examples of leaders who communicate effectively. A key differentiator between Apple and its competitors is that they don&rsquo;t simply sell computers, (the &lsquo;what&rsquo;) they sell their passion for striving to be the most innovative technology company in the world (the &lsquo;why&rsquo;).</p><p> By communicating the ideas behind a product, leaders inspire their teams to care about what they are doing, rather than merely compelling them to go through the motions in order to complete a task. Leaders who effectively communicate the &ldquo;whys&rdquo; underlying what drives their organization on a daily basis evoke emotion, inspiring their people to take action and reach higher goals.</p><p> Are there any leadership competencies that you find to be successful?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve heard people say they would prefer to hire for attitude over aptitude, because they can teach the person how to do the job-but they can&rsquo;t teach someone how to have a different attitude. This is a very absolute statement that sounds good on the surface, but perhaps isn&rsquo;t as useful in practice.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s a question:  How many times have you worked for a company that hired and promoted individuals that were good at everything but the job they were appointed to do? </strong></p><p> During the course of my career, I have seen this so many times I have lost count and I suspect you are no different.</p><p> These candidates who are revered for their &ldquo;attitude&rdquo; are good at being the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; man or woman. They may be good at throwing others under the bus. They excel at focusing on details in every situation that don&rsquo;t require any attention at all. They come early and stay late. Quite possibly, they are good at being a poor leader and the list goes on and on. What seems like deficiencies from a reasonable person standard has now translated into a coveted management position with a generous salary and everyone is asking  <strong>  &ldquo;how and why&rdquo;? </strong></p><p> What good does it ever do to put the wrong person in the wrong job? It does no good. Not only does it make the people reporting to the person and working with the person resentful- it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Hires and employees that lack the knowledge, skills, and abilities to the job they are tasked with negatively impact productivity, morale, and engagement.</p><p> The companies that take training and development seriously are the minority these days.  Since that is true, it also means that not only are we hiring and promoting the wrong individuals based on &ldquo;attitude&rdquo; but it probably means they are never truly going to be developed up to meet the aptitude requirement anyway.</p><p> The right fit is something many companies strive for when hiring new staff. The bigger question is why are we so fixated on hiring someone with the &ldquo;right&rdquo; attitude? Isn&rsquo;t our premise of the &ldquo;right&rdquo; attitude based on some bias anyway? Naturally, no one wants to work with a difficult person but what about all of the lesser extremes of personality?</p><p> The practice of hiring attitude over aptitude-in some cases shows us that the reality of working with someone with a different temperament than the company norm is so concerning that we would risk hiring or promoting the wrong person for the job.</p><p> We need to be mindful about setting both leaders and the support staff around them up for success. That starts with putting people that have the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities in the right positions and making sure they are duly trained and developed to carry out their duties. I don&rsquo;t mind working with someone that isn&rsquo;t warm and fuzzy, as long as they are respectful and can be a valued and contributing member to the team. What drives me crazy however- is working with people that fit a pre-baked company profile and are completely inept at doing their jobs.</p><p> As an HR practitioner, much of the blame for this kind of mismatch falls on us. Perhaps, the message we need to send is one that recognizes the value of personality and demeanor in selecting individuals for a particular position balanced with the need to have someone who has the acumen to be of value to the organization.</p>",

    "title": "Advisors: 4 Keys to Creating a Culture of Connection",
    "link": "advisors-4-keys-to-creating-a-culture-of-connection",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Proactively connecting with clients is what we refer to as \"creating a culture of connection\" within your business. Yesterday's strategies for success are no longer effective in today's rapidly changing environment. There are four trends every advisor should understand if they want to create value and connection.</p><p> <strong>  Trend #1: Teams! </strong></p><p> The majority of top producing advisors now work as part of a team while also building a network of professionals to compliment that team, an approach that brings numerous advantages.  First, teams allow advisors to bring specialty services to clients that may not be readily obtained from an advisor works alone. And while the structure of a successful team may be influenced by many factors (demographics, geography, etc.) my favorite case study is of a top producer that has ascribed to the team approach over the past 10 years.  As part of a 5 member team―an analyst, another rainmaker like himself, one operations person and one administrative \"plus\" person-this advisor has reached $1.5 billion in AUM, a level not easily reachable by the solo operator.</p><p> Building out your network of experts will require a concentrated effort, but upgrading your services will be easier if you have a group of top professionals you can connect with. And while my example above demonstrates the success a team approach may bring, I strongly encourage you to also forge ties across disciplines as you strive to improve your service, connectivity and production.  Your network should be without boundaries, so connect with professionals like CPAs, estate attorneys, insurance professionals, IT experts, elder care managers, banking professionals, and therapists including life coaches.  These untapped connections can present significant opportunity for your business because in today's environment, it's more powerful to realize that referrals are earned, not asked for.</p><p> The next two trends are demographically based:</p><p> <strong>  Trend #2: The Aging Population </strong> <br/>   <br/> As the average age of the world's population increases, advisors need to understand and address the factors that impact this client segment.  As a whole, these investors will experience the longest retirement periods in history in the face of low savings rates, declining pension plans and a questionable future for Social Security. As a result, they will need advisors that not only do they trust, but ones that may help them coordinate the broad range of services their situations may require.</p><p> <strong>  Trend #3: The Greatest Transfer of Wealth </strong> <br/> <br/> While an aging population naturally presents us with this next trend, the statistics are staggering on the number of investors receiving generational wealth that select another advisor to manage the wealth.  <br/> <br/> This really needs to be our wakeup call!  Through our own myopia, we are letting assets simply walk out the door rather than trying to keep the assets already entrusted to us!  Have we forgotten the basic lesson that it is easier to retain existing assets than attract new assets?  Take the time and identify your clients with generational connections and build those relationships. <br/> <br/> The other side of this trend is being prepared to service high-net-worth (HNW) assets.  To date, countless studies have been done on the complex needs of HNW individuals.  Despite this plethora of information, we continue to disregard the message and focus on pushing products to our HNW clients when what they really want (and need) is wealth management. This demand/need takes us back to the discussion on building your network of professionals as effective wealth management simply can't be achieved without help.</p><p> <strong>  Trend #4: Understanding the Female Investor. </strong></p><p> To help you comprehend the magnitude of this market, consider the current reality:</p><li> For every 100 men that graduate from a U.S. university, 133 women will graduate</li><li> While the gap is narrowing, women on average still live longer than men</li><li> 80-90% of women will be solely responsible for managing their own finances at some point in their life <br/>  </li><p> Of the four trends, this one may require the greatest re-working of your approach as there are important nuances as to how women approach investing compared to men.  Plus, their investment timelines may vary relative to men's based on time in the workforce or longer life expectancies. <br/> <br/> On this topic there is a plethora of studies and information to help guide you in the right direction including our \"$14 Trillion Woman\" program.  And speaking of direction, you may do well by remembering the old stereotype―when lost, men keep driving while women will stop and ask directions.  Are you prepared to provide a meaningful road map that differentiates yourself from other advisors?</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Social Media is being increasingly accepted in today&rsquo;s business world, no matter the field. But Social Media in the Financial world, and more especially for Financial Advisors, Wealth Managers and even Private Banks, is still subject to a lot of rejections. Asset Management firm  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.putnam.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Putnam Investment  </a> </u>  recently came up with a survey from July 2014 taken from over 700 financial advisors in order to better understand how  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.putnam.com/literature/pdf/AR223.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial Advisors use Social Media  </a> </u> . Results will make think twice about your Social Media efforts!</p><p> &ldquo;66% gained clients via social media&ldquo;&hellip;I guess this number is self-explanatory. It is a huge number indeed! But looking more closely, it makes sense. People connect and interact more and more with social media; Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, Google Plus&hellip;are some of the ones most of the people know. Just like any business, you go get clients where they are&hellip;and in today&rsquo;s the World, even in the Financial sector, client&rsquo;s are on Social Media! </p><p> Now when it comes to Social Media, people tend to get confused; Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest&hellip;which one should I pick? Although I tend not to assume anything with my own clients and like to start from scratch with basic questions (ex: where are my clients?), I will strongly recommend Linkedin as a must for any Finance professional. Linkedin is &ldquo;The&rdquo; Social Media for business and its importance is constantly growing with over  <u>  <a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   332M users  </a> </u>  in January 2015. According to Putnam survey, 64% of Financial Advisors use Linkedin and 56% of them gained new clients this way. Still thinking?</p><p> &ldquo;36% of financial advisors use Facebook&ldquo;&hellip; and 83% of them gained new business this way. Boom! I know, it&rsquo;s a LOT! Most of the advisors using Facebook here are under 30 years old, which make sense. But think twice, it means for Financial Advisors, clients are also on Facebook.  while a considerable number of advisors would never step in. Here, we are tapping onto the famous &ldquo;Millenials&rdquo; target group which, as all Finance professionals know, hold the future of the Financial Sector. They bypass bank wire cost using  <u>  <a href=\"http://luckyattitude.co.uk/sorry-banks-but-millennials-love-transferwise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TransferWise  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://press.bbva.com/latest-contents/press-releases/bbva-chile-launches-first-bank-account-on-facebook-in-latin-america__9882-22-c-107312__.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook just like in Chile with BBVA  </a> </u>  and hack card fees using  <u>  Magnises, NYC latest hype Black Card </u> .</p><p> Now, are you still thinking it is a waste of resources to invest in Social Media? With time, these figures will go bigger, new social media platforms will arise and more tools will help Marketing Managers track the ROI on Social Media efforts. Just like with any craft, the sooner you start, the better you&rsquo;ll get!</p><p> Like that article? check out our Social Media Menu for more content about  <u>  Social Media for Financial Advisors and Professionals </u> .</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> There is a sweet spot to be aspired to in your business endeavour; where you achieve perfect equilibrium between client satisfaction and an appropriate profit margin for your business. I use the concept of equilibrium deliberately. Many service providers get completely skewed in one direction or the other&mdash;giving up client satisfaction for the sake of profitability, or profitability for the sake of the client experience. This point, of course, brings a critically important decision. There are times when we consciously give up profitability for the sake of the client experience. Such times would include the early stages of business development, when business volumes have not reached the level needed for target profitability.  And those times when, perhaps in resolution of an error, a decision is made to provide recompense in some form. What I am saying, fundamentally, is client experience always comes first, especially if you plan to be around for a while. I am also saying though, it is critical to have a specific margin in view objectively, and then to monitor every element of the revenue and cost structure of your business in order to achieve and maintain that margin.</p><p> The major firms do this. Many create numerous &lsquo;micro-segments&rsquo; of their client base to get a sense of an &lsquo;equilibrium&rsquo; profit margin for each segment and the implications this calculation must have on setting client expectations and then delivering against those expectations.</p><p> In my next few articles I will dig into this profit equilibrium concept in some detail. But let me leave you with this. You have probably calculated already that the cost involved in acquiring a new client is a multiple of the cost of keeping an existing client. There are important decisions to make here.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Don&rsquo;t you just love the new? Shiny, sparkly, brand-spanking new ideas to ponder.</p><p> But sometimes, new is over-rated.</p><p> Sometimes, you want something with a little patina, a little seasoning.</p><p> That&rsquo;s how it is with marketing your service business.</p><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;m re-sharing a popular post (updated a tad) on three tactics to win more clients next year. </strong></p><p> You may not have seen the original post(s). Or if you did, you and your business may be in an entirely different place this time around. I think it's worth a fresh look, especially if you are itching to make some major inroads into building your client base.</p><p> Before you dive in, let me take just a moment to wish you the merriest of holidays and a brilliant start to your New Year&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait to see what exciting plans you have in store for yourself (if you&rsquo;re feeling inspired, hit reply and tell me what you&rsquo;re working on for 2017).</p><h3> <strong>  Tactic #1: Refresh your website. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your website is, after all, your billboard. It&rsquo;s also the one piece of on-line real estate that is 100% in your control. You set the tone, define your point of view and direct traffic to and from your site. It&rsquo;s your hub.</p><p> So at least once a year, take a look at your site with fresh eyes. Is it modern? Mobile-friendly? Easy to use and navigate? Does it fit with your brand and your audience? How&rsquo;s it working for you? Is it bringing you qualified potential clients or wasting your time with bad fits?</p><p> Here are the questions you want to be asking to decide what needs refreshing:</p><li> What&rsquo;s the last post date of your blog? If it&rsquo;s more than a year ago, you don&rsquo;t have a blog, you have a slug. Either commit to updating it regularly or take it down. You can repurpose old posts into articles and put them in a separate section of your site.</li><li> Do you mention dates that make it seem like you haven&rsquo;t updated your site in a few years? Unless it&rsquo;s an Oscar, Tony or Emmy, nobody cares that you won an award in 2008. Lose the dates, keep the (significant) awards.</li><li> Take a look at your photos. Be honest now&mdash;are they looking a little sad?  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/giving-great-photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Getting new photos taken may not be your idea of a scintillating time, </a>  but I guarantee they will freshen up your site (not to mention your social media pages) and ratchet up your game.</li><li> Is your copy all in third person? Maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to step into the light. Yes, if it&rsquo;s all about your company, third person may well be the way to go. But if you ARE the company, then try talking about yourself and your work in the first person. It feels odd at first&mdash;but to the reader (aka your future client)&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a personal conversation that draws them in.</li><li> Does your site have a front-and-center opt-in to stay in contact with you? You do not want to make people dig three screens down just to add their names to your digital list. And no, social media icons do NOT count.</li><li> Is your contact form actually working? Test it. If it goes somewhere other than your primary email address, how often are those messages checked? Nothing annoys a potential client more than hearing nothing back from an initial inquiry.</li><li> How long does your site take to load? I can&rsquo;t even count the number of times I&rsquo;ve clicked on a site link that took so long to load I gave up (sidebar: now is also a good time to go through all your social media profiles and test the links to make sure they are sending your visitors to the right place).</li><li> Is it time for video? You don&rsquo;t have to get fancy&mdash;or even expensive&mdash;depending on your brand of course.  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/rocking-the-camera-8-tips-to-unforgettable-video/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  But if shooting the right video </a>  will build your audience, it may be an investment that you&rsquo;re ready to make.</li><li> Does your site make you happy? Does it feel like you? Does it represent how you want your message projected out into the world? If not, it&rsquo;s time to invest in a remake&mdash;perhaps simple, perhaps sublime&mdash;to catapult you into the realm you are ready to join. <br/>  </li><p> So please. Do yourself a favor and take a good hard look at your website. Whether it&rsquo;s a tweak or an overhaul, you know it&rsquo;s time.</p><h3> <strong>  Tactic #2: Make media work for you. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s the thing about media: it&rsquo;s a little like dating. If you attach yourself too much to a specific outcome, you will be disappointed.</p><p> You want to approach getting more media coverage as the cherry on top of an already luscious sundae. If you NEED it to sell your services right now, this minute, you are spending your time and money in the wrong place. Desperation in media never attracts the right people to your doorstep.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t have the budget to hire a media maven? No worries&mdash;all you need is to carve out two to five hours a week to work at it, bit-by-bit. It&rsquo;s a process, not an event.</p><li> <strong>  Step 1: Define Your Sweet-spot Audience.  </strong> Before you even  think  about media, be crystal-clear on your ideal audience. Who are your best buyers? One way to go:  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/developing-your-client-avatar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  create a client avatar. </a></li><li> And keep that image firmly in your head as you discover where your ideal clients spend their media time. <u>    </u></li><li> <strong>  Step 2: Explore your options.  </strong> Where is your best future client or target likely to trip over you? Traditional, big media outlets&mdash;broadcast, digital or print? Or niche players that may never make a big splash nationally/globally but are filled with your ideal crowd? Give this process short shrift at your peril: avoid the pure ego-feeds and go for those that truly fuel your progress.</li><li> <strong>  Step 3: Choose Your Top 10 Media Targets. </strong>  Yep, I said  10 . Not 50, not 25, but 10. Because you want to stay focused on the prize: upping your visibility where it matters most. The less time you have available, the smaller your target list should be (note: even if you&rsquo;ve got the budget to hire yourself some media help, keeping your target list small increases your traction).</li><li> <strong>  Step 4: Build Out Your Media Contact List. </strong>  You want to get to know the reporters, bloggers and producers who control access to the kingdom you want to enter. Do the legwork required to build your list. Scroll through articles on your Top 10&mdash;what bylines consistently appear? Dig into the articles your target writes. Does he/she seem to have a consistent point of view? That tells you how to approach them. Think of these folks as prospective clients you want to court&mdash;understand their interests and hot-buttons and make it personal. Best place to reach them if their digital address is elusive? Twitter!</li><li> <strong>  Step 5: Know How Media Folk Think (And Work Best). </strong>  This is where a little empathy goes a long way. They are on deadline. They have editors to satisfy. The best have many potential sources&mdash;you get one fast shot to respond to their request and that&rsquo;s it. Assume the ONLY thing that matters is their story. Get clear on the angle first and quickly decline if it&rsquo;s not right for you (but don&rsquo;t discount the value of being the contrarian interview). If you&rsquo;re pitching a story, put some bait on the hook. Nobody gives a fig that you just opened your business, but they might care deeply if you link it to breaking news, a hot trend or compelling story.</li><li> <strong>  Step 6: Arrive In Uniform, Ready To Play. </strong>  Nobody asks an empty suit back for a second shot. Do your homework&mdash;over-preparation can be a virtue if it means you&rsquo;ve created a perspective no one has articulated yet. You need to be 100% on your game. Close your email, shut off the phone and completely concentrate on your interview. If you&rsquo;re on camera&mdash;whatever the platform&mdash;comb your hair, put on some make-up and look like you&rsquo;re happy to be there. Just because you&rsquo;re on video and not in a television studio does not give you permission to lower your standards.</li><li> <strong>  Step 7: Repeat. </strong>  Media is a process. The pros who get the best coverage for themselves build media into their everyday work life. They remain on the lookout for new media partners and outlets. They build relationships. They make courting their media an integral part of their work and actually have fun with it. <br/>  </li><p> Fun? Yes, I did say fun. Because let&rsquo;s face it&mdash;if you see courting and working with media folk as drudgery, it&rsquo;s not for you.</p><h3> <strong>  Tactic #3: Build Your Digital List. </strong></h3><p> <br/> You might think this isn&rsquo;t all that important, especially if you&rsquo;re getting plenty of leads by referral and have a decent close rate.</p><p> You would be wrong.</p><p> Your digital list&mdash;however you decide to use it&mdash;is the only direct feed to your audience that YOU own. It&rsquo;s not subject to LinkedIn&rsquo;s connection rules or Facebook shutdown. It&rsquo;s yours to happily&mdash;and privately&mdash;build the client base of your dreams.</p><p> A few ground rules. While you own the list, you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; your audience. It&rsquo;s your job to earn&mdash;and keep earning&mdash;their attention. That means quality content, limited commercials (never, EVER more than 20% of your content. Under 5% is even better for some sophisticated brands) and absolutely, positively, zero spam.</p><p> I would further say that it&rsquo;s hard to go wrong if you view your list in the sacred trust category: respect, honor and duty matter.</p><p> With that in mind, here are some tips to start growing your list&hellip;</p><li> <strong>  Offer focused, quality digital content. </strong>  Know your audience&mdash;if you&rsquo;re just starting, be clear about whom you want to pull in. And create consistent (generally weekly or bi-weekly), reliable, compelling content. How will you know when you&rsquo;re firing on all cylinders? People you&rsquo;d like to work with start interacting. They might write you a quick email response, comment on a blog post, retweet or like a post. Don&rsquo;t use their hiring you/buying your products as your first sign. Engagement first, commerce second.</li><li> <strong>  Have a you-can&rsquo;t-miss-it sign-up on your website. </strong>  It should be above the fold on each page (in the masthead is perfect) and should visually pull the observer in. Chances are your list sign-up is your &ldquo;big banana&rdquo;, the one thing you want visitors to your site to do. We could debate whether to do &ldquo;pop ups&rdquo; on your site till the cows come home. Just do it. I guarantee there is a way to make it work within your brand and the stats consistently bear out a 50%+ sign-up increase.</li><li> <strong>  Sprinkle additional sign-ups across your site. </strong> Invite people to sign-up after every post. If they enjoyed reading that one, they might well enjoy having them delivered automatically, right? Look for a balance of invitation, great visuals and white space.</li><li> <strong>  Trade something of value. </strong>  Offer up a free piece of content ONLY available to new subscribers. Whether it&rsquo;s a PDF download or a quiz or a white paper&mdash;make it brand-relevant and good enough to pay for. Because if your free stuff is that good, your paid work must be bad-ass indeed.</li><li> <strong>  Market your content. </strong>  You put a lot of thought into your content&mdash;from blog posts to articles to videos. Put some of the same effort into distributing it. Post it on your social media platforms (and on Twitter take the time to use a short URL to increase your re-tweet potential). You&rsquo;ll drive folks to your site&mdash;boosting your SEO AND building your subscriber base (when they can&rsquo;t resist your giant sign-up bar).</li><li> <strong>  Use social share buttons. </strong>  Make sharing your content easy breezy.  <a href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A basic WordPress plug-in </a>  upped my social shares by almost 50%.  Make yours not only a no-brainer, but highly visible.</li><li> <strong>  Brand your stuff. </strong>  Choosing a cool or sexy or, well, unforgettable, name is just smart. Not for the sake of hipness, but to perfectly capture your intent, your brand and your market position. What makes you memorable?</li><li> <strong>  Get in the habit of automatic promotion. </strong>  This means putting a link in your email signature and your social media profiles. Build it into ALL of your promotional material&mdash;from your guest blogging byline to your bios across literally every digital platform you occupy. And don&rsquo;t forget your face-to face interactions&mdash;telling your story at business events, being introduced when giving speeches and workshops. Don&rsquo;t make them work to find you or your best bits. <br/>  </li><p> Building a list isn&rsquo;t glamorous. It isn&rsquo;t sexy and some would even say it isn&rsquo;t fun (I totally disagree with them by the way). But if you are truly committed to building your brand, your idea, your book, your company&mdash;it&rsquo;s essential.</p><p> Make it personal, make it real and make it something you are excited about. Because just doing it by (and for) the numbers won&rsquo;t keep you at it.</p><p> <strong>  Tweetable question: What tactic made your email list take off? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Ken Sullivan&rsquo;s diagnosis of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease at age 47 unleashed a torrent of feelings: shock, isolation, fear.  It&rsquo;s probably why he lost his demanding job at a large financial company.</p><p> The diagnosis was also emotionally devastating for his wife, Michelle Palomera.</p><p> But for both of them, it was a rude awakening to the myriad financial preparations required for Alzheimer&rsquo;s.  Even though both are financial professionals, they had no idea how complex it would be to revise their existing financial plan, how hard it would be to find professionals with the specific legal and financial expertise to help them, or how long this project would take &ndash; 17 months and counting.</p><p> &ldquo;This disease has so many layers and aspects to it,&rdquo; Palomera said.</p><p> The risk to an older individual of getting Alzheimer&rsquo;s is only 10 percent &ndash; and early-onset like Sullivan&rsquo;s is even rarer.  But when there is a diagnosis, one issue is the lack of a centralized system for managing care and coordinating the myriad professionals and organizations involved.  These range from the medical people who diagnose and treat an Alzheimer&rsquo;s victim to health insurers, attorneys, social workers, disability and long-term care providers, and the real estate agent who may be needed if a victim or the family decides they can&rsquo;t remain in their home.</p><p> Sullivan and Palomera had always shared their family&rsquo;s financial duties.  But Sullivan&rsquo;s new struggles with details and spreadsheets left these tasks entirely on Palomera&rsquo;s shoulders &ndash; all while juggling her job as a managing director for a financial company.  &ldquo;If something were to happen to me, I have to be really air tight on having everything squared away so the trustee &ndash; someone &ndash; can manage the situation for our daughters and Ken,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> After Sullivan&rsquo;s June 8, 2013 diagnosis, the couple called family to gently break the news. Their next calls were to a disability attorney and a financial planner.   They&rsquo;ve since gone through four estate attorneys to find one who could answer their questions and suggest the best options for themselves and daughters Leah, 9, and Abby, 11.</p><p> Questions revolve around trusts, long-term care costs, and whether to file for Medicaid or technical divorce.  For example, if something happens to Palomera, the couple established trusts for their daughters to ensure they&rsquo;re taken care of.  Sullivan and Palomera used to hold durable powers of attorney and healthcare proxies for each other, but Palomera had to assign this to someone else.</p><p> Before his diagnosis, Sullivan felt that something was amiss.  A senior vice president for a Boston financial company, he became forgetful in meetings and withdrawn from the employees he managed.  Palomera noticed he was forgetting to pay credit card bills he&rsquo;d always been on top of.  For months, they wondered whether he was suffering early-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s or garden-variety stress, as one emergency room doctor speculated. They also did not know which tests their health insurance would cover and then endured a primary care physician who incorrectly told Sullivan that his spinal tap test for Alzheimer&rsquo;s gene markers was normal.</p><p> An immediate financial issue was a decline by about half in the family&rsquo;s income after Sullivan&rsquo;s layoff.  This transformed their lifestyle from very comfortable to very frugal.</p><p> The first thing to go was a plan to decorate their home in Scituate, a stylish suburb on Boston&rsquo;s South Shore.  Palomera lists the things they can no longer afford: shopping for nice clothes, saving for retirement, and traveling to Europe &ndash; they visit friends instead.  &ldquo;We really just buy what we need, not what we want,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> They&rsquo;ve also pared back saving for their daughters&rsquo; college educations, and they must hire a baby sitter when Palomera has out-of-town work. Their daughters receive Social Security benefits due to their father&rsquo;s impairment, which qualifies him for federal disability assistance.</p><p> Although Sullivan looked for a new job after his layoff, he said he no longer feels up to working. To stay active, he runs the family&rsquo;s errands. He is also a national early-stage advisor to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association and volunteers at the Friendship Home, which helps children with Aspergers and Down syndrome.</p><p> &ldquo;Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I have chosen to raise awareness of the disease,&rdquo; says Sullivan&rsquo;s testimonial promoting a  <a href=\"http://act.alz.org/site/TR/Walk2014/MA-MassachusettsNewHampshire?px=7849417&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=5153\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  walk </a>  in Plymouth, Massachusetts, that he helps organize to raise funds for Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p><p> A large and lurking financial issue for the couple is paying for long-term care if Sullivan becomes incapacitated.  They are too well off to qualify for Medicaid, which funds care for Americans who lack financial resources. The cost for a skilled nursing facility averages $5,750 per month but can reach or exceed $10,000, according to Genworth. </p><p> An attorney helped them apply, successfully, for long-term disability through Sullivan&rsquo;s former employer &ndash; it pays 60 percent of his former base salary, excluding bonuses.  Rather than use these payments to shore up their immediate finances, it&rsquo;s being saved for Sullivan&rsquo;s future care.</p><p> Revising their financial plan has been &ldquo;much more complicated than I expected,&rdquo; Palomera said. It consumes much of her free time &ndash; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s still not done yet.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Due to a more health-conscious society and recent advances in medicine,  <strong>  Americans are living longer </strong> . While it used to be unusual for a person to reach their 100th year, such longevity is becoming more commonplace. This is great news, but it does push some questions about life insurance to the forefront.</p><p> <strong>  What happens if a client outlives his or her insurance policy? </strong></p><p> Many life insurance contracts, particularly those drafted before the early 2000s, endow when a person reaches the age of 95 or 100. Depending on the terms of the individual policy, this situation typically results in 2 distinct outcomes:</p><li> <strong>  Premiums on the policy will no longer be due and the client may be able to postpone payment. </strong>  The value accumulated thus far will continue to grow on interest alone until it is eventually paid out at a later age or at the insured's death.</li><li> <strong>  The cash value of the policy may be paid out immediately. </strong>  While on its face this may sound good, it  <strong>  can actually create a problem due to the potentially harmful tax consequences to the beneficiary </strong> . For example, if an individual has paid $2 million in premiums over his or her lifetime and is paid out the full $5 million cash value, rather than the death benefit, in a lump sum, a $3 million tax liability would result. Given that many choose life insurance policies to offset substantial estate tax liabilities, a lump sum payout could negate the purpose of choosing insurance in the first place. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  One solution available to your clients is to request &ldquo;extended maturity benefits&rdquo; from their life insurance carrier. </strong></p><p> This is a rider which extends the duration of the policy, often for no extra cost. Some extend coverage to the age of 120, and others for the entire lifetime of the policyholder, no matter how long he or she lives.</p><p> <strong>  This type of extension is not something the insurance carriers will advertise. </strong>  It&rsquo;s up to you to look out for your clients&rsquo; interests.

    "title": "The Dirty Little Secret About Immigration No One Wants To Talk About",
    "link": "the-dirty-little-secret-about-immigration-no-one-wants-to-talk-about",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/freedomandcap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Howard I. Schwartz Ph.D.  </u> </a></p><p> There is a big, unspoken taboo topic that as far as I can see almost never gets mentioned in the immigration debate: by what right do we possess this land? This is the big lurking issue that can and should totally reframe the terms of the debate. How so?</p><p> The whole question of immigration turns on a problematic distinction between &ldquo;us&rdquo; versus &ldquo;them,&rdquo; where the &ldquo;us&rdquo; are those who are citizens and the &ldquo;them&rdquo; are those who are not. No one seems to want to acknowledge that the distinction of &ldquo;us&rdquo; citizens versus &ldquo;them&rdquo; noncitizens is exceedingly problematic. It is problematic for all sorts of reasons. The very notion of a citizen, of course, assumes that there is a national entity (a state) that can make one a legitimate citizen. And the notion of a legitimate state, for its part, rests on the notion that the political entity granting citizenship has legitimate sovereignty over its land or territory. The state decides the rules within its territorial boundaries including who are citizens and who are not. The close relationship between the state and land has been understood since the beginning of natural rights theory which posited a kind of one to one correspondence between the rights individuals have in their land and the territory that a state oversees. In other words, there is no state without land, and states by definition have sovereignty over a territory. The close relationship between the United States and its land is simply taken for granted in the debate over immigration as a kind of background assumption.  But what is anything but clear is Americans&rsquo; original right to the land they occupy.</p><p> <strong>  Americans&rsquo; Right To Land </strong></p><p> Hang with me here for a moment. I know I am bringing up an issue that is an already settled fact on the ground. The United States has existed as a legal entity since 1789 when the Constitution was ratified. The individual states themselves existed since July 1776 when independence was declared from Great Britain. Before that, the colonies were under various kinds of charters. To question whether the United States has sovereignty over its territory opens up a theoretical can of worms that has been settled by history, right?</p><p> Not so fast. The problem with the current debate about immigration is the way in which we take for granted the reified categories of &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them,&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; versus &ldquo;noncitizen.&rdquo; These distinctions are exceedingly problematic and tenuous. The &ldquo;we&rdquo; versus &ldquo;them&rdquo; rests on a fundamental assumption that &ldquo;we&rdquo; have a right to be here and &ldquo;they&rdquo; don&rsquo;t. But if we examine the history of this question that moral distinction falls completely apart even if it is currently a settled fact. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><p> The dirty little secret in the founding of the United States, and the American States before that, is that the Americans didn&rsquo;t have clearly defined rights to the lands they occupied. The settlement of North American lands was part of a primarily British conquest of America that was justified by various colonial theories about rights, property and land. Protestant Britain, following after Catholic Spain, leveraged various European colonial, Christian and natural rights justifications for taking the American lands. For the most part, the American founders&rsquo; ignored or downplayed the question of what gave Americans the right to their land. We can understand why this was the case. By the time they declared independence from Great Britain, the colonies were already well populated on the East Coast of North American. In defending their American rights, they looked up at their British oppressors and didn&rsquo;t look at the oppression they were exercising on native nor slave populations. Still founders, such as Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and James Wilson, did occasionally ponder the question of their rights to North American lands in the period leading up to the Revolution. &lt;1&gt;</p><p> <strong>  The Founders Ponder Our Rights to Land </strong></p><p> Jefferson, for example, in his first political essay, A Summary View, drew on one stream of natural rights theory which argued that the European settlers had a right to American lands based on conquest; winner take all. James Wilson, who was uncomfortable with such a view, put forward the European and Lockean theory that land that was uncultivated could be taken by anyone. Since God had intended land to be worked, no people could keep land which they didn&rsquo;t cultivate. The assumption that natives did not cultivate the land was a mistaken one but it helped justify the American position. John Adams expressed some discomfort with such justifications and acknowledged in his pre-Revolution essays the view that natives had their rights to the land. He thus expressed doubts about any legitimate European claim to the lands.&lt;2&gt;</p><p> It should not be surprising that the American founders ignored and suppressed the question of their right to the land in the Declaration of Independence, the very document justifying their right for independence as a free state. Still, this was a glaring omission when all theorists of the state at the time would have said that the question of a state&rsquo;s relationship to its territory was a critical issue in the legitimacy of the state. The Declaration was after all their justification to become independent united states. Eventually, the Supreme Court under justice John Marshall would take up this issue of land in a landmark 1823 decision in Johnson v. M&rsquo;Intosh. The court adopted the European &ldquo;doctrine of discovery,&rdquo; a colonial view which gave the European sovereigns who &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; North America rights to the land, a position that had been put forward earlier by Spanish Catholic and British Protestant explorers going back to the time of Columbus.</p><p> <strong>  The European Christian Conquest of the Americas </strong></p><p> Historians of the period indicate that the British Protestant conquest of North America was itself modeled on the earlier Spanish conquest of what is now Latin America and South America. The Spanish Catholic and British Protestant competition was both a colonial expansion and a religious post-Reformation competition. The Spanish conquest, which came first, and which some aptly describe as a &ldquo;Holocaust&rdquo;, was justified by the Catholic Church through a series of papal bulls issued by the Pope. The brutal details of both conquests have been amply documented by historians. &lt;3&gt;</p><p> I am sorry to remind Americans of this dirty little secret that &ldquo;we&rdquo; never really had an original right to the land. But it is a fact that should at least be part of the discussion whenever we attempt to deal with the immigration problem, which is framed as a distinction between those who are legally here and those who are not. Of course, if &ldquo;we&rdquo; had no right to the land in the first place, the &ldquo;we&rdquo; versus &ldquo;them&rdquo; is exceedingly problematic. Even if &ldquo;we&rdquo; were all descended from the first Europeans to occupy the land, which a majority of us are not, and even if each of us acquired citizenship legally, the very basis of that citizenship is granted by an entity that really had questionable rights to grant citizenship on its territory.</p><p> <strong>  The Problematic &ldquo;We&rdquo; Versus &ldquo;Them&rdquo; </strong></p><p> To problematize the &ldquo;we&rdquo; versus &ldquo;them&rdquo; distinction further, the &ldquo;them&rdquo; in many cases are &ldquo;nonlegal aliens&rdquo; from Mexico, Latin or South America who in many cases are blood descendants of Spanish and native Americans. One could actually argue that they are a more authentic &ldquo;we&rdquo; then &ldquo;we&rdquo; are, since they at least have more native blood than the majority of us, European, white descendants. To argue about the immigration issue as if it is a matter of legality and rights, therefore, is deeply paradoxical, if not immoral. To be sure, we could get off into a highly theoretical debate over the question of whether the native populations that the Europeans met on this continent had themselves stolen the land from others before them. One could as I have in fact argued indeed it is &ldquo;theft&rdquo; and &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; all the way back in human time. But even if that perspective is true, it hardly justifies the moral claim that somehow because &ldquo;we&rdquo; are here last, we have rights to the land. Such a moral argument is nothing more than a claim that power makes right.</p><p> Still, my point is to remind us that we have no rights to this land that ultimately are more legitimate than anyone else&rsquo;s. The distinction of &ldquo;us&rdquo; citizens versus &ldquo;them&rdquo; noncitizens is a fiction reinforced by power, law and the myths we tell about ourselves and our origins. What this means if we seriously weigh its implications is morally profound and disturbing. It awakens us to the arbitrariness of history that puts us and our children on this side of the line and others and their children on the other side of the line. That moral and historical insight should temper our attitudes and by extension our practices in how we move forward in differentiating those who are legal from those who are not. &lt;4&gt; How that insight should shape the immigration debate is of course open to interpretation. But it at least should be considered, as we try to draw lines between &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them.&rdquo;</p><p> ****</p><p> 1.

    "content": "<p> Our world needs a new type of leader who is courageous, selfless, humble, innovative and remarkably effective. We desperately need leaders who have a vision and passion for creating new market opportunities and a better future not just for themselves but also for society at large.</p><p> Shawn Askinoise, CEO and Founder of Askinoise Chocolate transformed his passion to create a sustainable solution in the world. It's the  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZUlOm7NV3w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  story </a>  of one man, who builds communities, making an enormous difference in the lives of many and still making a profit with purpose.</p><p> <strong>  It's All About Chocolate. It's Not All About Chocolate. But Yes, It is Totally About the Chocolate </strong></p><p> Shawn Askinoise, CEO and Founder of Askinoise Chocolate, has been described as \"Willy Wonka with a philanthropic streak.\" But after talking to him, I would simply say he is what our world needs: a bold new leader who is making a profit and a difference. He is someone who does not put social responsibility in a silo but integrates it into daily work as his business purpose is directly linked to his community and even more so to being a citizen of the world.</p><p> So why is it about the chocolate? Askinoise Chocolate is a small batch chocolate manufacturer located in Springfield, Missouri, sourcing 100% of their beans directly from the farmers. Shawn Askinosie, founder and chocolate maker, travels to regions of the Philippines, Tanzania, Ecuador and Honduras to work directly with the farmers and source cocoa beans for their chocolate. This enables Askinosie Chocolate to profit share with the farmers, giving them a Stake In the Outcome&trade;. The Askinosie Chocolate mission is to serve their farmers, their neighborhood, their customers and each other and to share the Askinosie Chocolate experience by leaving the world a better place than they found it.</p><p> <strong>  What Are the Problems Askinoise Addresses? </strong></p><p> After a career as a criminal defense lawyer, Askinoise decided to reinvent himself and find a new path. He spent time searching for a new inspiration and decided to pursue his passion, which is now a little chocolate factory in Missouri with 15 people who are involved in the local community and communities around the world. His passion for chocolate included facing two big challenges:</p><p> <strong>  Challenge #1: </strong> The barriers to the market were enormous. He needed to figure out how he could make a profit and run a financially sound business and also address the social problems he saw in the community. He addressed this challenge by establishing his chocolate factory in a neighborhood that was going through revitalization. \"We became aware of the needs of our neighborhood just by being close to the homeless shelter that houses 80 children a night and we wanted to involve those children in our business from the very beginning with our Chocolate University.\"</p><p> <strong>  Challenge #2: </strong> The barriers extended to the globe as sourcing cocoa beans directly from farmers from Honduras, Ecuador, Tanzania and the Philippines provided a clear view of the problems they were facing in their communities. \"By rubbing up against these farmers, we learn about their problems and needs.\" He shared. \"Then the issue becomes one of how we partner with them without becoming the great American savor to the world.\" Shawn sees his work as simply helping them find their own, unique solutions through partnership.</p><p> <strong>  What Are the Solutions? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Solution #1: Link Your Business and Profitability to Your Community Through Sustainable Solutions. </strong> Here is how Shawn does it: \"We produce 8 metric tons of cocoa shells in our chocolate making process. Often they are simply thrown away. We trade them with local farmers who use it as a fertilizer and mulch and in turn people in our factory get fresh vegetables as a trade. What would normally be thrown away we use to get food for people in the factory. \"</p><p> <strong>  Solution #2: Invest in Your Local Community by Addressing Social Problems. </strong> Why? It will help your business grow. As interest increases in how the chocolate is produced, Askinoise Chocolate opened its doors to people who wanted to tour the factory. The money raised went directly to the community like building a basement at the homeless shelter \"and turning it into to a computer lab for the students who are there to study and have some sense of normalcy like other kids.\"</p><p> <strong>  Solution #3: By Listening, Understand Needs and Build Sustainable Solutions that Change Lives. </strong> On a global level, the issues Shawn uncovered were about hunger. He believes that \"There is no way we would have come up with the problems and solutions had it not been the fact that we source our beans directly from farmers.\"  <br/> By working with local PTA communities in the Philippines and Tanzania, local solutions were found. In Tanzania where every child eats one meal a day, the local PTA spearheaded a program one metric ton of rice that would be 6,000 meals was transformed into a quarter million meals just by leverage in the American marketplace. The key lesson here is that solutions are formulated locally.</p><p> <strong>  What Can Each of Us Do? </strong></p><p> When asked about leadership, Shawn's insights were illuminating. He believes that many leaders today are missing humility. \"That lack of humility will end up hurting our country and hurting the world. It is an impediment to social problems at home and abroad.\"</p><p> <strong>  Call to Action #1: Educate Yourself and Ask the Hard Questions </strong> <br/> Shawn's asks that we all do research about the companies we do business with. We need to find out where the food you are eating comes from. Are the companies that you are supporting acting in a way that is worthy of your financial support? Shawn challenges each of us to really look closely at what you are spending money on and what the companies are investing in. How are they giving back and being socially responsible?</p><p> <strong>  Call to Action #2: Take One Step  </strong> <br/> Anyone can make a difference. You don't start a non-profit or join one to contribute. All it takes is taking one small step every day and reaching out to one person who can use your help. As Shawn says: \"You won't only help them; you will also help yourself. People are overwhelmed thinking they can't do anything about people in their community or hunger in the world. Yes, you can. We can make it happen.\"</p><p> <strong>  We need to re-imagine business leadership </strong> so we can inspire a generation of business leaders who recognize that social problems in the world and our community from housing to hunger to education can at a large measure be solved by business. For young leaders, when you dream this dream for yourself. Take one step toward that dream. This step of action in faith and action toward your dream will unlock and open so many doors of opportunities. That one step will do so much for their future and the future of their communities.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryandrjweaver\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ryan Weaver  </u> </a></p><p> I have always followed the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/release23/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research on sedentary lifestyles  </a> </u>  and its correlation with disease and obesity&mdash;as a casual observer.</p><p> It is always troubling to see how many people are falling victim to unhealthy lifestyle choices (sigh, not me). At times a glimpse of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&amp;retrLang=eng&amp;id=1050501&amp;pattern=obese&amp;tabMode=dataTable&amp;srchLan=-1&amp;p1=1&amp;p2=-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the latest obesity statistics  </a> </u>  in the headlines has prompted me to send a forward to an afflicted family member, or shoot a quick message to a friend that I know has been slacking at the gym: &ldquo;Time to step up the cardio or else  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/7946/20140708/poor-physical-activity-levels-blamed-rising-obesity-rates-stanford-study.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you&rsquo;re going to look like this  </a> </u> , man.&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s why I was shocked to read that  <u>  <a href=\"http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/7/dju206.full\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent research  </a> </u>  confirms a sedentary lifestyle is correlated with higher incidences of not just obesity, but cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer&mdash;and basically anything and everything that can slowly kill you, regardless of whether you exercise on a regular basis. In short, compensating for sitting around all day with a one hour high intensity workout at the gym is no defence; all office workers are doomed. </p><p> <strong>  There is Hope: How to Avoid Death by Office Chair </strong></p><p> Still in a state of shock, there was only one person I could bring myself to call, Occupational Therapist Matt Gereghty. </p><p> Not only does Matt know a thing or two about workplace health and safety but since I had a sinking feeling that the news was going to be bad I needed someone who could give me the prognosis with a side of humor (If you&rsquo;ve read Matt&rsquo;s blog, i.e. &ldquo; <u>  Your wrists are like baby squirrels </u> &rdquo; you&rsquo;ll understand).</p><p> <strong>  Confirmed: Sitting All Day is Killing Us </strong></p><p>  &ldquo;The trouble with prolonged sitting,&rdquo; Matt tells me, &ldquo;is that it puts the majority of our body into sleep mode and while seated, our largest muscles groups (our body's engine) are essentially turned off. This has a profound effect on our energy expenditure and metabolism.\"</p><p> \"The fact that we are exposing ourselves to eight hours of low metabolism every day at the office, then one hour for the commute, two hours of television watching, etc. means that over time, our body is going to adapt to these horrible conditions - this is when we start to see health problems like obesity, diabetes, heart disease and even cancer,\" he added.</p><p> <strong>  Also Confirmed: Standing All Day Isn&rsquo;t Great Either </strong></p><p> &ldquo;The research confirms that daily exercise is not fixing the problems caused by over-sitting. What we need in order to stay healthy is frequent bouts of non-exercise activity time in order to avoid some of the detriments. That&rsquo;s why I usually suggest that people sit as little as possible,\" says Gereghty.</p><p> \"I love the idea of standing desks &ndash; but replacing eight hours of sitting with eight hours of standing is not a good idea either. The sweet spot is somewhere in between; or to spend time alternating between standing, walking and sitting,\" he noted.</p><p> <strong>  Tips for Staying Healthy in the Office Environment </strong></p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to just sit there and die. Matt Gereghty&rsquo;s top three tips for surviving your office:</p><p> <strong>  1. Look for Opportunities to Stand Up throughout the Day </strong></p><p> Matt recommends taking a long hard look at all of one&rsquo;s daily work activities to seek out opportunities to stand up and or walk around. How about turning your next meeting into a &ldquo;walk and talk&rdquo;? You can also try standing up while answering phone calls or reading documents. &ldquo;If you have  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.standingdesks.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a standing desk  </a> </u> , use it!&rdquo; Exclaims Matt.</p><p> <strong>  2. Take Frequent Breaks to Fire Up Your Metabolism </strong></p><p> You don&rsquo;t even have to necessarily &ldquo;take a break,&rdquo; simply use the stairs rather than the elevator to get to your next meeting. &ldquo;Even better,&rdquo; says Matt, &ldquo;try some squats or push-ups &ndash; whatever your level of office embarrassment will allow.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  3. Drink Enough Water </strong></p><p> Something you probably already do anyway. Drinking plenty of water balances bodily fluids, keeps you from consuming too many calories, and helps to energize your muscles.  The fact that you are sitting on your butt all day is probably why you don&rsquo;t realize how dehydrated you in fact are. </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> So would you?  Would you have your wedding at Starbucks?  How about your reception? Lets switch venues, how about at Taco Bell or Subway?</p><p> While I have never heard of a Taco Bell reception, I have been tracking the phenomena of Starbucks weddings and receptions since I worked on my first book about the company back in 2006. For example, an article on  <u>  Entertainmentwise.com </u>  pictorially recounts 13 recent Starbucks wedding receptions.   The phenomena of engagements, marriages and receptions at brands like Starbucks or another company about which I have written, Zappos, demonstrates what it means to become a beloved brand  That is not to say that marital unions have to be taking place in your business to prove your belovedness to customers but such actions show how closely a brand connects with the values and identity perceptions of its customers.</p><p> In my latest book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1bMHcME\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leading the Starbucks Way  </a> </u> , I explore a model of brand love created by Graham Robertson (president of the brand strategy firm aptly named  <u>  <a href=\"http://beloved-brands.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Beloved Brands  </a> </u> ).  Graham&rsquo;s model defines brands along a continuum of customer emotional connection that goes from indifference, like it, love it, and ultimately to beloved brand for life.  The key to the last category is that customers view the brand as a form of &ldquo;self-expression&rdquo; where they are outspoken fans who will not switch loyalties because they have formed lifelong memories connected to the brand.</p><p> Brand love has power in the market place.  Beloved brands get more positive media attention, they have increased social media following and viral marketing campaigns and as we are all coming to learn more weddings and significant life events either in their buildings or with their products and services prominently displayed (e.g. think of Star Wars theme weddings as an example).</p><p> Your goal may not be to have customer say &ldquo;I do&rdquo; at your dry-cleaning business or your sushi restaurant but it is to have them say &ldquo;they do&rdquo;.  They do allow me to express myself.  They do serve as an extension of my identity.  They do hold a special emotional place for me through the memorable experiences they produce.</p> ",

The initial impact is a searing pain. The side effects can linger for a very long time. Disengagement is personal in nature and affects each person individually. Like a snowflake, no two stories are ever alike. But all disengagement can have a monumental impact on life. Every disengaged person has a reason for why they transformed into an unhappy and dissatisfied worker. And every- one deals with that feeling differently. The one constant: there is always some underlying cause or trigger for the disengagement. There is always that &ldquo;moment.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The Tree of Life </strong></p><p> All new trees begin with just a seed. Once a tree is planted, roots grow underground and spread. The naked eye can&rsquo;t perceive the vast and growing roots; we can only focus on the tree trunk, branches, or leaves. What&rsquo;s invisible to us from ground level is how the tree has manifested underground and whether an ailment is stunting its growth. If there is a disease impacting its roots, we won&rsquo;t know that until something else happens to help surface the problem. Before the tree can be treated, and hopefully saved, we need to know the exact cause of the problem.</p><p> Disengagement is a lot like a sick tree. On the surface our physical attributes might show a happy, satisfied person, but underneath, at our roots&mdash;those things which support us and keep us steady and strong&mdash;something is dreadfully wrong, spreading discontent and malaise throughout our whole being. In order to heal, we must first identify the underlying cause.</p><p> It&rsquo;s pretty common to see a disengaged person smile on the outside while feeling enormous pain on the inside. We&rsquo;ve all become masters of disguise, whether at work or with our loved ones. We&rsquo;ve become conditioned to the cycle, and it can be a great coping mechanism. The problem is, like our tree of life, one day it will shed its leaves, lose its color and vibrancy, and eventually die. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t hide behind the smile forever.</p><p> <strong>  The Workplace Is a Breeding Ground of Disengagement </strong></p><p> Disengagement doesn&rsquo;t just show up one day on a whim. Usually one or more gradual factors have a bearing on this issue and cause it to rear its ugly head. Disengagement is not a sudden experience. It occurs over a period of time and slowly eats away at the passion you have for your job until there is none left. Many of the causes of disengagement are linked together, but you don&rsquo;t need to experience all of them to become a target of the disengagement disease&mdash;even one can cause your roots to rot.</p><p> There are five main reasons (and a number of other small, related ones) that drive disengagement. Taken alone, each of these has a significant impact on the level of engagement a person can have in their job. Think about what could happen if more than one of these were tied together. Remember, disengagement is a choice. It may not feel like it in the moment, but we all have the opportunity to fight back or simply give in to whatever ails us. However, the first step in curing disengagement is to recognize and acknowledge the issue.</p><p> In this chapter we will profile five employees to illustrate each of the underlying causes of disengagement. This should help you begin your journey of self-discovery and ultimately arrive in the reengagement phase of the trip.</p><p> <strong>  Disengaged Employee #1: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Hey, This Job Isn&rsquo;t What You Promised Me </strong></p><p> Sally is an eager, motivated young professional who has worked in a series of customer-facing jobs since graduating college two years  ago. She&rsquo;s always been told that she is great with people and believed that the right career direction for her was to get hired by a stable, prof itable company in the financial services industry that was known for outstanding customer service. Imagine her excitement when Acme Bank, one of the top f inancial services organizations in the Midwest, hired her to work in their customer call center.</p><p> Sally&rsquo;s job was to answer calls from clients with questions about their retail banking accounts and to help solve any issues they may have. On her f irst day, she arrived at a cubicle with a computer, a phone, a headset, and a thick manual full of procedures and processes. At the time, she didn&rsquo;t have a clue as to what came next. No one was assigned to her as a mentor, no supervisor came by to welcome her, and no one offered her any guidance. She was expected to pick up the phone when it rang. This went on day after day, and Sally eventually became more adept at her job and comfortable with the required service-level standards.</p><p> <strong>  But she never felt happy or committed to her job. </strong></p><p> How many of us have experienced an interview process (sometimes a lengthy, exhausting one) that sold a pretty picture of what the job entailed, only to find out later it was an entirely different experience? This happens all the time. It isn&rsquo;t unusual to be misled about the job responsibilities or even the job itself.</p><p> It is unrealistic to think a job description will always be an exact mirror of the job in action, but it&rsquo;s also not unreasonable to expect that the job resemble the description during the interview process. When that doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be the case, it can lead to feelings of frustration or even betrayal by the hired employee. These are roads that can lead straight into disengagement. No matter how well a job is described, sometimes if it&rsquo;s a new experience, no amount of initial explanation can truly represent the actuality of the role.</p><p> Call centers are the poster child for this kind of reality show. Even if the interviewer was incredibly detailed in how he described the job, if you have never worked in that particular environment, you have no idea what it&rsquo;s like to answer calls all day from unhappy customers while under tight productivity measures. The result can be a quick and steady downward slope of emotions and resentment toward the job. You begin to question your decision, feel as if you were taken advantage of, and eventually disengage.</p><p> <strong>  The Right Foot </strong></p><p> Regardless of function, level, or industry, no job is immune to this notion of the position not matching what was promised. It&rsquo;s all part of starting off on the right foot with honest employers who are realistic and respectful. The result will be a more loyal, connected, and excited team willing to contribute at a maximum level if they are clear on the expectations set forth for them from day one.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t just a basic tenet for someone new to a role. As priorities shift and other things come into play, jobs can and will change over time. It is incumbent on the manager and employee to meet periodically to reset expectations and goals.</p><p> The smartest leaders are those who understand that engagement really starts during the hiring process. That meeting is the first opportunity to build trust and demonstrate to your potential hire that you care about him and his engagement with the job. I recently had a conversation with Don Fornes, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.softwareadvice.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Software Advice  </u> </a> , about employee engagement. Don has done a phenomenal job of creating an engaged workforce. I inquired about his secret sauce. Here&rsquo;s one of the keys to success he shared with me:</p><p> &ldquo;I tell my managers to get the right people in the right seats. It all starts with hiring and then giving our people autonomy. We give each person their own project, which is special and apart from their regular job. I want them to own it. I show people early on what the path for them looks like. I tell them: while you may be doing this job today, a year from now you will be doing this other job and make this amount of money. I believe everyone needs a vision.&rdquo;</p><p> When a job doesn&rsquo;t match the expectations and leadership takes no action to remedy the situation, employees will likely just go through the motions without any commitment or loyalty to their employer, all the while having their frustration build.</p><p> <strong>  The Cure </strong></p><p> It all starts with an effective recruiting process. Companies need to be more committed to taking their time and getting it right. We&rsquo;re not just talking about putting &ldquo;butts in chairs.&rdquo; In the spirit of Zappos, recruiting should be a multistage process. Here are some key steps to consider for your hiring process:</p><li> Create a thorough job description that details all the major tasks expected of the employee. Included in the description should be a list of any measurements or standards for this role (i.e., production numbers, sales quotas, etc.), so there is no confusion as to what is required of the employee</li><li> Give a copy of the description to anyone interviewing for the role so you are both on the same page.</li><li> Thoroughly pre-screen all applicants to make sure they meet the basic requirements for the job before moving to the next phase of the interview process.</li><li> Using the job description, create a series of behavioral-based interview questions designed to elicit examples of how the candidate has handled these kinds of situations before. The best predictor of future behavior is past performance.</li><li> Select a team of interviewers that can each hone in on different things. For example, one person might be focused on questions regarding customer service skills, another on how someone approaches teamwork with colleagues, and a third on how they manage others.</li><li> Offer prospective candidates a chance to look around the workplace to get a sense of what the environment will be like.</li><li> Make sure that throughout the entire process your candidates feel comfortable asking questions and clarifying what they&rsquo;ve heard so far. Those who don&rsquo;t ask any questions usually haven&rsquo;t done their homework, which is a big red flag.</li><li> ​Look for people who talk about what they can do for the company versus what the company can do for them. It will increase your odds of hiring someone predisposed to com- mitment and engagement.</li>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Carden Calder | <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blue Chip Communications  </u> </a> , Sydney NSW</p><p> Last year  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/ladies-gentlemen-start-your-engines-2014-is-about-to-begin/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we predicted what the year 2014 would bring  </a> </u>  in terms of content, social media and ROI measurement for the financial services sector.</p><p> How right, or wrong, were we? With 2015 now underway, we take a look at how 2014 unfolded.</p><p> <strong>  &lsquo;Hyper-targeted&rsquo; marketing </strong></p><p> We said hyper-targeted marketing using &lsquo;big data&rsquo; for small relationships would grow in importance. From our own experience, we have seen how useful these tools have been for marketers. Sites that record your history, location and purchases now target consumers based on ever narrower profiles.</p><p> One example of this is Facebook ads, which can be tailored specifically towards an audience and their behaviours. According to the Social Media Examiner&rsquo;s 2014 industry report, 90% of marketers said they regularly use Facebook ads <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   [1  </u>  ] </a> . In one 2014 consumer campaign we found Facebook ads far better at targeting narrow audiences than an equivalent spend in print advertising. At the same time using Facebook gave us the opportunity to test and learn before spending the client&rsquo;s whole budget.</p><p> Similarly, in 2014 Twitter launched a new way for businesses to leverage existing databases to better target potential customers by enabling them to specifically target consumers who have shown prior interest, purchased products before or have asked to be contacted. <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   2  </u>  ] </a></p><p> The year to be seen &ndash; literally and figuratively</p><p> We said social media sites would be all about visuals and that text would fall out of favour, as indicated by falling adoption rates and engagement.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://digitalmarketingphilippines.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital Marketing Philippines  </a> </u> , visual content marketing is now one of the hottest digital marketing trends, with the ever-increasing popularity of visual social media such as Pinterest, Instagram, Vine and others used by both business owners and digital marketers.</p><p> In 2014, Instagram recorded more than 300 million monthly active users (up 50% in just nine months) <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   3  </u>  ] </a> , outdoing other sites such as Twitter. Visual content in Facebook campaigns generates 65% more engagement and content views can jump up to 48% if they contain both photos and video <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   4]  </u> </a> .</p><p> <strong>  Strategic communications the key for financial advisers </strong></p><p> We said that for advisers, increased clarity would enable greater focus on enhancing their practices, whether through growth and consolidation, addition of new service lines, partnering with other professionals or aligning themselves with like-minded groups.</p><p> 2014 showed that building and protecting brand reputation is no easy task for our industry. The reputational stumbles of the year made high quality communication and marketing even more important. This has accelerated the move towards integrated approaches that combine more traditional areas such as profile building and media with social media and content marketing / thought leadership.</p><p> 2014 research from Zurich Financial Services Australia found that the use of social media platforms by financial advisers has grown significantly, with a substantial amount of advisers incorporating social media into their client communication strategies. 31% of advisers are now using mobile tablets with clients, compared to just 7% two years ago. <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   5  </u>  ] </a></p><p> <strong>  The power of a good story and effective measurement </strong></p><p> We said that compelling storytelling that resonates with clients, partners and customers would be the key to communications success and that measurement would also be vital. Online platforms have made it easier to show how effective our efforts are and reporting functionality can show more detail and analysis about our audience, its habits and behaviour than ever before.</p><p> In 2014, 67% of the Fortune 500 websites used Google Analytics and/or a combination of Google Analytics and other web analytics tools <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   6  </u>  ] </a>  and we are only going to see this trend increase.</p><p> <strong>  Sponsored content, longer term strategies and smart data </strong></p><p> We said that the use of sponsored content would be on the rise. Sponsored content enables financial services companies to build a presence in harder to penetrate, non-financial sites that may be more consumer orientated, enabling you to gain the value of attracting a larger audience.</p><p> According to the Wall Street Journal, 2014 was the year for sponsored content. Large online publishers stepped up their efforts to sell branded articles, with major marketers including GE, Intel, L&rsquo;Oreal and Mountain Dew increasing their investment in the tactic <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   7  </u>  ] </a> . In 2014, The Times reported a 16.5% increase in digital-ad revenue during the third quarter, which was fuelled by its native-advertising product paid posts. <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftn8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [  <u>   8  </u>  ] </a></p><p> So did we get it right or wrong? It&rsquo;s not a clear cut answer, but it&rsquo;s clear 2014 saw the majority of financial services brands recognise the need to use content on multiple platforms, integrate their marketing channels and tactics, and do better online.</p><p> ****</p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2014.pdf  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [2] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.zogdigital.com/2014/02/19/hyper-targeting-twitter-businesses-can-leverage-big-data/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://blog.zogdigital.com/2014/02/19/hyper-targeting-twitter-businesses-can-leverage-big-data/  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [3] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/its-official-instagram-is-bigger-than-twitter/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/its-official-instagram-is-bigger-than-twitter/?_r=0  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [4] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://digitalmarketingphilippines.com/12-reasons-to-implement-a-visual-content-marketing-campaign-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://digitalmarketingphilippines.com/12-reasons-to-implement-a-visual-content-marketing-campaign-infographic/  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [5] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adviservoice.com.au/2014/10/financial-adviser-usage-social-media-mobile-technology-latest-survey-results-announced/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.adviservoice.com.au/2014/10/financial-adviser-usage-social-media-mobile-technology-latest-survey-results-announced/  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [6] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.e-nor.com/blog/google-analytics/google-analytics-maintains-lead-with-fortune-500-in-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.e-nor.com/blog/google-analytics/google-analytics-maintains-lead-with-fortune-500-in-2014  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [7] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/12/17/sponsored-content-that-buzzed-in-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">   http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/12/17/sponsored-content-that-buzzed-in-2014/  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/a-round-up-of-2014-the-year-that-was-in-financial-services-communication/#_ftnref8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [8] </a>   <u>  <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/media/media-companies-strike-gold-sponsored-content/295679/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://adage.com/article/media/media-companies-strike-gold-sponsored-content/295679/  </a> </u></p>",

    "content": "<p> The toughest transition in management is going from managing a job function to managing both a job function and other people at the same time.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re only managing a job function, all the work and results are on your shoulders. Everything succeeds or fails based on your efforts alone. There should be comfort in this! With these parameters, you can set your own pace and priorities with only the calendar deadlines in mind. You  determine when you have to work longer hours and when you can cruise. You control what does or doesn&rsquo;t get done.</p><p> <strong>  But oh how all that changes when you&rsquo;re managing other people! </strong></p><p> Suddenly, you&rsquo;re expected to not only do the work &mdash; but to share it with others and make sure they do their part, too. Every task and project forces you to consider the time and talent of others. You have to think about their skills and abilities. You have to think about their needs and expectations. And you still have to think about the deadlines and results to be met.</p><p> Whew.</p><p> Managers who are new to the supervisory function often find themselves frustrated and out of balance trying to find the right combination of delegation and development opportunity for themselves and the people who report to them &hellip; truthfully, even those who&rsquo;ve been in the supervisor game for awhile struggle with this. Knowing where to draw the line on entrusting the work to your team or doing it all yourself never gets easier.</p><p> The reality is that you can&rsquo;t do it all yourself. If that were possible, you wouldn&rsquo;t even have a team. Companies don&rsquo;t waste resources on unnecessary staff these days. If you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to have support staff, you better take care of them and keep them busy with value-adding work.</p><p> That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can just delegate and be done with it. Successful supervision is not achieved without significant effort. When you assign tasks to be completed, you have to follow up to make sure they are done completely and correctly. This is the cornerstone of accountability. It&rsquo;s not about checking up on people or assigning blame when things aren&rsquo;t done. It&rsquo;s about making sure the integrity of the job function you&rsquo;re responsible for remains in tact. It&rsquo;s about protecting the reputation of your function, department and ultimately your organization.</p><p> Unfortunately, supervisors struggle with balance here too. In the effort to ensure all the work is done, supervisors are often accused of micromanaging their subordinates. However, there is a difference between micromanaging and holding a person accountable. It is important for supervisors to know the difference.</p><li> <strong>  Micromanaging is exercising unnecessary control over the processes involved in completing work in effort to ensure certain outcomes.  </strong> Micromanaging discourages and stunts the development of subordinate employees. Micromanaging hinders general growth and improvement of process, talent and performance within an organization.</li><li> <strong>  Accountability is the obligation an individual has to explain activities and disclose the results to other interested parties. </strong> Accountability demonstrates responsibility for results and aids in the development of subordinate employees. Accountability encourages feedback and integrity. Accountability helps the growth and improvement of process, talent and performance within an organization. <br/>  </li><p> One is about control, the other is about responsibility. One hinders, the other helps. One is bad, the other is good and very necessary. See the difference?</p><p> So the next time you&rsquo;re wondering if you&rsquo;re being too hard on your subordinates by asking lots of questions, making them correct work or explain the reasoning behind their decisions, think back on these definitions and decide if you&rsquo;re really micromanaging or just holding them accountable. If your intentions are to help them grow to the best level of performance possible, it&rsquo;s not micromanaging &mdash; it&rsquo;s being a good supervisor. Keep going and don&rsquo;t stop.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Monique Kassa | <a href=\"http://plasticbank.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Plastic Bank  </u> </a></p><p> Illac, a successful entrepreneur in the Philippines, serves as the executive director at MyShelter Foundation, a nonprofit organization that makes life better for many Filipinos by fostering the use of recycled materials to build badly needed things like clinics and classrooms in rural areas of his country.</p><p> And you would never believe what they use to build those buildings&hellip; They use plastic bottles people have thrown away!</p><p> The idea for using plastic bottles came to Illac when he was trying to figure out how to address the lack of affordable building materials in the Phillipines, while meeting the health and education needs of rural Filipinos.</p><p> Working with others, he came up with the idea to use plastic empty plastic soda bottles as an ultra-low-cost building material. The bottles were in abundance in rural communities, but viewed as garbage until Illac figured out that they could use them for a higher purpose.</p><p> For many Filipinos, their new classrooms and clinics unleashed a whole new way to look at waste plastic. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;upcycling&rdquo; &ndash; taking something after its intended use and reusing it for a completely different purpose that solves a problem and meets a need at the same time. Plus, using local labor from the community meant that the economic benefits stayed in the community.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s pure innovation, accessible to millions of poor people around the world. </strong></p><p> Upcycling is not just a one-off solution. It is a philosophy and an approach that can be brought to bear on many social and environmental problems. It&rsquo;s this mindset which led The Plastic Bank to ask Illac to be an advisor in the first place.</p><p> <strong>  Upcycling plastic bottles into schools and clinics was just the beginning. </strong></p><p> One of Illac&rsquo;s global success stories is the incredible Liter of Light project. Millions of people live in crowded slums and shantytowns around the world. Often, these dwellings don&rsquo;t have something we all take forgranted &ndash; electricity and light. So people are literally in the dark in their own homes.</p><p> But Illac figured out another way to upcycle plastic bottles and bring light to peoples&rsquo; homes. Filling the bottles with filtered water and adding a little bit of bleach makes light glow &ndash; these bottles are then installed in the roofs to bring daylight below.</p><p> Today, thousands of homes around the world have been illuminated using this simple, low-tech approach. This simple source of light has created meaningful and immediate change in the lives of thousands of people.</p><p> These are the kinds of practical changes and concrete differences that can be made in peoples&rsquo; lives using what is already around us in abundance.</p><p> We just need to look at things in a new way. We need to reimagine what is waste, and what is opportunity. This is what The Plastic Bank is doing, and this is why we have launched our crowdfunding campaign.</p><p> Inspired by Illac&rsquo;s work, The Plastic Bank takes the abundance of plastic waste and turns it into a currency that can help lift people out of poverty and clean up our planet at the same time.</p><p> Soon, we&rsquo;ll all be looking at plastic waste in a whole new way.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a financial professional, you may not be aware of what is going on in your elderly clients&rsquo; daily lives,  but families sometimes find out about scammers who have victimized their loved ones.  You could come across them too.</p><p> An adult child of your client may mention a situation that is alarming or your clients may tell you themselves about this &ldquo;great product&rdquo; they&rsquo;ve gotten.  If it sounds odd, start asking questions.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s an example: </strong></p><p> According to the Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier, an adult daughter discovered that her aging parents were spending thousands of dollars on supplements to fix a wide range of health problems.  The scammers were from Las Vegas based Leading Health Source, and they had taken advantage of the elderly couple&rsquo;s vulnerability to their sales pitch.  It might not have been so bad if they had simply sold the couple a reasonable amount of nutritional supplements. But over a period of 20 months Leading Health Source had ripped off the elders for more than $44,000, a sum they couldn&rsquo;t afford.</p><p> This is the piece to which we, at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestors.com  </a> </u>  want you to pay the most attention.  In this instance, the daughter took action.   She went to bat for her aging parents, rather than doing nothing or considering it her parents&rsquo; problem.</p><p> Leading Edge was investigated after the daughter reported the large sum her parents had paid to them.  The daughter had attended an event held by Iowa Fraud Fighters at Kirkwood Community College.  Presumably, she learned there that she should file a complaint with the state Attorney General and she did so.</p><p> The outcome in this case was very good for the elders.  The matter was settled, and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office demanded that Leading Edge pay back everything the couple had paid to them. That meant getting a check from Leading Edge for more than $23,000 to start and having the remainder of the credit card charges reversed.</p><p> The Courier, source of this story reported that the Attorney General&rsquo;s investigators found Leading Edge well aware that the people they were selling to in this case were easily manipulated.  Their telemarketers&rsquo; handwritten notes indicated that the elderly woman involved had &ldquo;memory&rdquo; issues and that her husband had dementia.</p><p> What can you, the professional, just managing money or offering products to your aging clients learn from this?</p><p> First, note that memory issues and dementia in an aging couple is a setup for fraud and abuse.  If you think your own client may have these issues, even a little, beware. You could be prosecuted if you proceed with transactions.  If law enforcement is contacted or FINRA is involved, you will be scrutinized.  It could be, in the above example that Leading Edge owners and principals didn&rsquo;t know what their unscrupulous telemarketers were doing.  Perhaps the telemarketers were motivated by a commission or other sales incentive and an easy opportunity presented itself with an easy sale.  But the principals were held liable nonetheless.  They either failed to supervise adequately or they looked the other way. They are consequently barred from doing business in Iowa.</p><p> The second thing to learn is that family of your client may be a very helpful asset to the ethical financial services professional trying to preserve capital for a client.  Understand your client&rsquo;s family relationships and whom to trust.  When even a whiff of possible abuse happens, you can report it to the authorities.  You don&rsquo;t have to be right if you suspect something.  You just have to be reasonable in what you think is reportable problem.  It&rsquo;s better to report it with the facts you do know and have it turn out to be a false alarm than to take the chance of not doing anything and have your client suffer the effect of theft and fraud.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/diminishedcapacitywebinar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn about dementia and its effect on financial decision-making capacity  </a> </u> .

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve been on Twitter since April 2009 and in that time I&rsquo;ve been able to create a community an with an amazing bunch of followers.</p><p> This is one of many articles about how I use Twitter, my intention is to help you and maybe help you, get more, from what is a great modern medium.</p><p> <strong>  The Power of 3 </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ve written many times about the power of Twitter for engagement, the expansion of ideas, debate and learning from meeting strangers and making friends alike.</p><p> Twitter should be a two way dialogue. Tweet something and people will make a comment or better still, start a conversation.</p><p> During my Twitter travels I often come across somebodies Twitter profile. It is always interesting to read a person&rsquo;s Advatar and see their last few Tweets.</p><p> <strong>  But People Let Themselves Down </strong></p><p> Too often when I look at a person&rsquo;s profile, last few Tweets are full of automated messages, Corporate &ldquo;let&rsquo;s throw something at the wall and hope it sticks&rdquo; Tweets or conversations where I don&rsquo;t understand the context.  I&rsquo;m sure that is meaningful to them, but not meaningful to me.</p><p> <strong>  Your Twitter Profile reflects You </strong></p><p> Sorry but I treat a person&rsquo;s profile, like I treat mine. It is an extension of myself.  When I visit your profile, I get a feel for the type of person you are.</p><p> <strong>  Sorry But I Never say Thank You, I Retweet (RT) </strong></p><p> Many people say Thank You on Twitter and there is nothing wrong in doing that.  I never do, or rarely do, sorry but after hitting 30,000 followers something had to give. I try and answer all conversations and comment personally and that takes a lot of time. <br/> My way of saying Thank You is to Retweet somebody. For me, that is the biggest (flattering) thing you can do on Twitter.</p><p> <strong>  So What is the Power of 3? </strong></p><p> Whenever I sit down and work through the interactions on my Twitter accounts, I will always try and finishing by leaving 3 Tweets / 3 Pieces of Content at the top of my Twitter stream.  It does not matter how many conversations I&rsquo;ve had, if you come and look at my profile, there should be content.  A reflection of me.  Better still, content you will feel to interact or even Re-tweet.</p><p> Turning round what i said above. If anybody visits my Twitter profile, it should have something interesting for that viewer.

    "content": "<p> The Houston Chronicle featured an article last year titled  <u>  <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/identify-fix-companys-vibe-81619.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How to Identify and Fix Your Company&rsquo;s Vibe  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s a short, well-written article with some good advice for how to correct non-aligning perceptions and engage employees. It&rsquo;ll take about 3 minutes to read it so what the heck, right? I&rsquo;ll wait&hellip;</p><p> I want to take the concept of your company&rsquo;s vibe a little further. Why? Because understanding your company&rsquo;s vibe and being true to it will determine whether your company succeeds or fails. Or at least the degree to which you will succeed.</p><p> Back in 1977, one of Apple&rsquo;s earliest investors, Mike Markulla composed what for me is probably the most elegant expression of a marketing and operating philosophy (a vibe!) I have ever seen&hellip;</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"956\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/apple-marketing-philsophy.jpg\" width=\"676\"/></p><p> Pay special attention to the term &ldquo;impute&rdquo; and its context. This is where your company&rsquo;s vibe is born and raised. It means that every part of your organization and every customer interaction should be imbued with the same high sense of purpose.</p><p> In other words, if you&rsquo;re proud of your core competencies (and you sure should be) then everything else you do should reflect that excellence.</p><p> According to this principle, it&rsquo;s not OK to say &ldquo;We&rsquo;re good at managing money. We don&rsquo;t need to worry about our website.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;people come here to work out, not to feel like they&rsquo;re visiting a resort.&rdquo;</p><p> Wrong.</p><p> Your customers and future customers want to experience you at your best &ndash; everywhere. All the time. Regardless of where that experience takes place.</p><p> Think of a vibe, a vibration, as the rapid movement of a guitar string. Then imagine everyone and everything in your organization operating on the same frequency.</p><li> You&rsquo;ve identified and corrected points of friction.</li><li> Your products, people and customer interactions are consistently great.</li><li> You solve problems quickly and gladly.</li><li> And you look, sound and behave in ways your customers expect and admire. <br/>  </li><p> Now imagine how empowering this concept could be for running your business.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re contemplating entering new markets or launching new products, you have to ask the questions, can we do this without losing our vibe? Can we have an even better vibe? What can we do to make sure our people are also experiencing the vibe?</p><p> Having a great vibe doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re edgy or hip. It means there&rsquo;s no dissonance, no disconnect between what you say, what you do and how you do it.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve probably heard someone describe a shop or restaurant saying &ldquo;that place has a great vibe&rdquo;. These days, that&rsquo;s a pretty profound recommendation. It implies a great product, great people and a great experience all coming together. It&rsquo;s a place people talk about and return to. It could, and should, be your business.</p><p> The exact same principle applies to financial services and other professional services firms. Think about your vibe. Change it if you need to. Keep making it better. And most of all, make sure everyone in the organization is true to your vibe.</p><p> Would you say your company has a vibe? How relevant is this concept to your business? Do you think the terms &ldquo;vibe&rdquo; and &ldquo;brand&rdquo; are interchangeable in this context? What companies or businesses do you think have a great vibe?</p>",

This included providing complimentary coaching sessions for women who were in transition, giving business advice to people who needed it, offering seminars at a reduced price when budgets were tight.</p><p> It's important to me to be generous. I am generous in my personal life and my professional way of doing things is very similar and it has served me well. I believe in paying forward and the philosophy that what goes around, comes around.</p><p> Recently however, I observed a trend where people (especially on Social Networks) are just asking and asking, without adhering any kind of etiquette.</p><p> Especially on Twitter there is a strong trend to just blast people with business offerings that are not relevant at all. The other day I got a tweet from a person who told me that they could make a famous musician of me. Really?</p><p> I haven't played the piano in years (the only instrument I ever managed to get a decent sound out of) and nobody wants to hear me sing.</p><p> LinkedIn is a close second.</p><p> Yes, I use the InMail function to reach people, but I always research them, their company, their background before touching base with them.</p><p> <strong>  Since when has the business world turned into a \"me-me\" society? </strong></p><p> The other day I reached out to a prospective client via LinkedIn and he responded, but immediately to conversation transitioned to his needs and how I could help him find a new job. I help people find jobs a lot, I am very well connected on LinkedIn and don't shy away from utilizing my network and my groups to promote people that I feel are worth promoting, but only if I know you and only if I have a good impression of that person.</p><p> I wouldn't recommend somebody who is self serving.</p><p> Why do I write about this? Because it's a trend, it's become systemic. <strong>  Wherever I turn, there are people waiting in the trenches to just pitch their services without regard who they actually target. </strong></p><p> Let's think about the \"good old\" days where we had to have conversations with people, either on the phone or in-person. You actually had to have human interaction and that was what kept us from doing things that we are doing today, because we can hide behind a computer screen and social networks. Just because you are using Twitter doesn't take away from your bad judgment. It's still you, the person using Twitter who is making the decision to send that message, or are you?</p><p> There is services out there that offer Twitter followers and the ability to manage your social media. Maybe this behavior is a result of it.</p><p> <strong>  In the end, if you want to be successful in sales and business, you will have to be careful how you manage your reputation, because that's all you have. </strong> Protect it and be careful not to leave a bad impression, because social networks can spread that negative message really fast, too!</p>",

A workshop for women should focus more on issues relevant to women, with a more narrow educational focus while creating an environment that get&rsquo;s women talking, during and AFTER your presentation.</p><p> <strong>  You do NOT need a PowerPoint to create a great workshop for women, you simply need a topic and 3 key points. </strong> From that point the creation is easy and it can be totally focused on what you do and your unique value. The key really understanding why you are hosting this presentation, what you as an advisor want to accomplish and then how you will go about creating momentum that motivates women to take action with you.</p>",

    "content": "<p> FBI firearms training pushed new agents to think on their feet when under pressure.I have vivid memories of one exercise where I walked down an abandoned ally. Observers watched from a platform above and behind me, so they could critique my every decision, my every move. I would be graded, so I was nervous and worried that my hands would shake and I&rsquo;d miss the shot.I put on a cap and sunglasses to keep the glare out of my eyes and started down the ally. A life-size cardboard cutout popped up from the ground. It was a big guy with a gun aimed at me. No problem. I shot him between the eyes.Ah, my confidence was up now! Even though I was nervous, I&rsquo;d put the bullets exactly where I wanted them. A few more steps and another cutout pops up&mdash;this time it&rsquo;s a woman holding a baby. I pulled out my gun because I was prepared for it to be another bad guy. I almost shot her but at the last minute, realized it was an innocent woman. It left me shaky because I&rsquo;d almost pulled the trigger.I continued down the ally and a third cutout pops up&mdash;another woman with a baby, only this woman held a gun and pointed it toward me. All I saw was a another woman with a baby, and didn&rsquo;t judge her to be a threat. Bang Bang, and I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s dead because she fired her gun.I failed to make a good snap decision. I still had so much to learn and wondered if I&rsquo;d ever get good enough to make the right call when the right decision really mattered.If we train ourselves to think on our feet, we&rsquo;ve mastered <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\">  an important skill </a> . Once we master it, our responses will create immediate confidence in what what we say and do.Confidence is critical as you learn to think on your feet. Confidence allows you to respond in ways that portray competency, trustworthiness, intelligence, and mental toughness.Are you mentally tough? Take this  <a href=\"https://laraequy.com/assessment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  FREE assessment </a> .Here are 5 ways you can learn to think on your feet when under pressure:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Prepare Ahead Of Time </strong></h3>The secret to thinking on your feet is to be prepared.You cannot be over over-prepared when you enter a meeting if there is even the slightest possibility of finding yourself faced with unexpected questions.This means taking the extra step&mdash;always. Yes, you may be over-prepared 99% of the time, but when you do eventually hear your name called out, you will know the answer.There will be situations where you aren&rsquo;t in control of the outcome; but, in situations where you can control your response, make the most of it.<strong> How To Make It Work For You</strong>: When you prepare for a meeting or an interview, you will need to work very hard as you brief yourself on the issues. Don&rsquo;t forget the alternatives, as well as the consequences of each alternative. With a bit of reflection, it&rsquo;s often possible to predict the types of questions you might be asked. You can prepare and rehearse some answers to questions that might come your way.<h3> <strong>  2. Give Your Thinking Brain Time To Catch Up </strong></h3>You&rsquo;ve probably heard it said a hundred times that you should always take a deep breath before you say or do anything when under pressure. If you&rsquo;re like me, you might have rolled your eyes every time you heard it.Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3KRJ2FU2I02CD&amp;keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow+by+daniel+kahneman&amp;qid=1564796190&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=thinking+f%2Caps%2C202&amp;sr=8-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Thinking Fast and Slow</a>,&rdquo; explains how our brains process information and emotions in different ways. The act of taking a deep breath isn&rsquo;t going to help you think on your feet. Instead, when you stall for time like this, it gives your slower, thinking cerebral brain time to process the facts and override the quick emotional limbic system that has freaked out.<strong> How To Make It Work For You</strong>: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to pause. When you do, turn your mind to something different so your thinking brain can analyze the situation. I don&rsquo;t recommend you carry a stress ball around with you, but it encapsulates the idea: focus for a moment on something else. Give yourself a second to breathe and formulate a plan<h3> <strong>  3. Be Savvy In The Way You Stall For Time </strong></h3>One of the best things you can do is learn how to be smart in the way you stall for time.For example, another secret to thinking on your feet is to ask for the question to be repeated, or better yet&mdash;repeat the question yourself, but this time change the wording slightly.When you change the wording slightly, the onus is now on the person asking the question to reorganize their thoughts. Their mind is no longer solely focused on their original question. They absorb the new thought or twist you introduced when you repeated their question.But, be clever about this. It can also be very obvious to the individual who asked  the question that you&rsquo;ve stalled for time or want to avoid answering it. The key is to slightly reword the question and subtlety introduce a new element.<strong> How To Make It Work For You</strong>: In a meeting at FBIHQ I was once asked, &ldquo;What operations have you initiated to stop the theft of intellectual property?&rdquo; The sad truth was that I hadn&rsquo;t initiated any operations.If I&rsquo;d thought on my feet, I could have reworded his question so it sounded like, &ldquo;What initiatives has San Francisco taken? Several&mdash;for example&hellip;&rdquo; The attention was moved from &ldquo;me&rdquo; to &ldquo;San Francisco.&rdquo;If I had prepared (see #1), I could have listed several operations initiated by my fellow agents. The momentum created by the direction I took the conversation would have shifted from what I personally had not done, and given credit to my colleagues who tested out some creative approaches.<h3> <strong>  4. Stick To One Point </strong></h3>The secret to thinking on your feet is to make one fabulous point instead of trying to cover everything.When you&rsquo;re under pressure to produce an answer, there&rsquo;s a tendency to try and cover up what you don&rsquo;t know by giving too much information. That does nothing but make you look as though you haven&rsquo;t organized your thoughts. You risk more probing follow-up questions from the individual who asked the question.<strong> How To Make It Work For You</strong>: Stick to one point and support it with facts. Long answers are always risky because they not only bore the listeners, they can make you look as though you are trying too hard to impress.<h3> <strong>  5. Admit You Don&rsquo;t Know The Answer </strong></h3>I&rsquo;ve had to fall on my sword more than once, but it was better to admit I didn&rsquo;t have the answer than peddle some BS excuse and hope no one noticed. Because believe me, they will notice.The secret to thinking on your feet is to look intelligent and competent, even when you don&rsquo;t have the answer.If you don&rsquo;t know the answer, admit it. Don&rsquo;t risk your reputation by trying to make something up. You will look foolish and that will lower your confidence, both in your own eyes and in the eyes of the others in the room.<strong> How To Make It Work For You</strong>: Come back with a hypothetical answer or solution. It also conveys a forward-looking response.Another technique that I used a lot as the spokesperson for the FBI in Northern California was this: I answered the question I wanted to answer, not the one actually asked. Again, often all it takes is rewording the question and introducing a thought into it that you can answer and back up with facts.Related:<a href=\"/grow/leadership/this-is-how-to-use-power-poses-to-find-success\"> This Is How to Use Power Poses to Find Success</a>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Companies are notorious when it comes to feedback.  </strong> There are countless systems developed, executed and utilized at all levels of an organization.  We want to know what people think !!  Or do we ??</p><p> Seriously, one of the areas that HR is thrust into on at least an annual basis is some sort of programmed, structured feedback.  You&rsquo;ve all seen it.  It can come in all kinds of packages &ndash; Performance reviews, 360s, Employee Engagement surveys, one-on-ones, etc.  So much feedback is gathered that it&rsquo;s actually very daunting !!  This is true because VERY little of the feedback taken in from employees is consistently acted upon.  This isn&rsquo;t being cynical.  This is being realistic.</p><p> We should have a day when we take all of the past strategy meetings, brainstorming sessions and annual reviews out from the past five years.  Then we should list out all of the feedback and data that was given across the organization and within departments to see what percentage ever came to life.  It would be minuscule I promise you !!</p><p> <strong>  Why is this?  </strong> I think there are some compelling reasons that need to be called out and then changed.</p><p> If you are gathering feedback in order to use reviews to &ldquo;build your case&rdquo; on an employee &ndash; stop it !!  If you need feedback on a few people, but you press the whole organization to participate &ndash; stop it !!  It&rsquo;s time to take the mystery out of feedback.</p><p> What do you actually mean by &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; ??  Are there parameters that people can follow?  What is the context as to why you&rsquo;re gathering feedback and how is it going to be used? How is the feedback going to be given to the person that we&rsquo;re reviewing?</p><p> Feedback can be a powerful tool IF (and that&rsquo;s a gigantic if !!) it&rsquo;s used for coaching and development.  If feedback is only gathered as a defense, or as a way to justify what you want to do with an employee, then you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.  I know that&rsquo;s a strong position to take but it&rsquo;s legit.</p><p> Most feedback in organizations is negative.  We spend countless hours on fixing people&rsquo;s weaknesses and gaps.  We even base entire compensation and bonus structures on what people don&rsquo;t do.</p><p> <strong>  Isn&rsquo;t this backwards ?? </strong></p><p> What if you tried to measure people&rsquo;s strengths?  What if you took time to give feedback on a regular basis at the time where it will be fresh, remembered and most poignant?</p><p> It&rsquo;s time for HR to rip open the mystery box and not allow systems that continue to measure what&rsquo;s not being done.  Your employees rock and want to do their best.  It&rsquo;s an opportunity to blaze a new trail and differentiate both your organization and your great team members.  Build a feedback system with clear parameters that allow people to flourish instead of wondering when the next shoe will fall.</p><p> Trust me.  If you choose to do this (and I&rsquo;m trying like crazy in my organization), then you will set a new standard of tangible development.  Feedback will be regularly and willingly given by employees.  It&rsquo;s refreshing and you should try it !!</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  People don&rsquo;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it </strong></p><p> This is the theme of a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sioZd3AxmnE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TED talk  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone-ebook/dp/B002Q6XUE4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   book  </a> </u>  by  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.startwithwhy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Simon Sinek  </a> </u>  &ndash; one of the most viewed in the TED series. It is a concept I have frequently used in helping advisors develop their value propositions. I have referred back to Sinek several times in recent engagements so I thought it seemed like a good time to share it with you.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Why&rdquo; connects with people. </strong> If you perform functions as a job, your customers may listen and consider whether to do business with you. If what you do is a mission, people with similar values or interests will connect with you, have an attachment to you, and be motivated to work with you. &ldquo;Why&rdquo; creates an emotional bond. &ldquo;Why&rdquo; puts persuasive power behind what you have to say. It motivates.</p><p> Sinek uses the example of Dell versus Apple. Dell made an MP3 player. It had lots of storage, lots of capabilities, and no customers. Why would anyone buy a music player from a computer company? And yet a huge number of us own an iPod. Dell is a great computer company. And the way Dell attempted to sell its MP3 player was describing capabilities and features. In contrast, Apple has a passion in everything they do to challenge the status quo. To think different. To create insanely great experiences. It just so happens that they did it by making computers. Then they turned their attention to music. Then phones. Lots of people were interested in a great new experience when it came to their music. They signed up in droves when the iPod was announced.</p><p> <strong>  Lots of advisors do retirement planning for teachers. </strong> They can tell you all about the state pension system, 403B accounts, early distribution rules, and catch-up provisions. One advisor I know had a relative who was a teacher her whole life. When it was time for her to retire, she spoke with the tax-sheltered annuity rep who advised her that when you retire you annuitize your contract. Tragically, she passed away less than two years after retiring. The family asked the insurance company what remained to be distributed. The answer was nothing &ndash; the contract would pay her for the rest of her life, however long that turned out to be. That experience drove this advisor into the business and became his Why. He spent a career saying to teachers &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re the kind of person who wants to decide how fast to use your savings and who or what you want it to go to if there is something left when you pass away, I am dedicated to showing you how.&rdquo; For many years he was in the top 10 of an organization of thousands of advisors. Teachers bought why he did it.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Why&rdquo; speaks to people&rsquo;s needs and desires. </strong> You may know that a particular prospective client needs a plan or a particular strategy but often they don&rsquo;t know that. When you talk about features and benefits clients may not connect them to what it is they believe they want. But talk about their &ldquo;why&rdquo; and they will relate. Sinek gives a brilliant example by rewriting a TiVo advertisement. Like Dell, TiVo talks about features and benefits. It talks about what their machines will do. You can save programs to view later. You can backup and replay portions of them. Who buys something like that? Rather than talk about what the machines will do, Sinek suggested leading off with &ldquo;if you are someone who wants total control over your television experience, have we got something for you.&rdquo;</p><p> If you have a strategy for reducing volatility in a portfolio, don&rsquo;t talk about limiting fluctuations or mitigating risk or having a beta of .6. Say &ldquo;if you lose sleep when the market starts swinging around, we have a strategy for you.&rdquo; Once you capture their imaginations you will get a chance to tell them about features and benefits.</p><p> <strong>  Your value proposition, your elevator pitch, should be about the &ldquo;why.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> As Sinek says: the goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. Will clients be inspired to refer you because of what you do? No. Lots of other advisors do all those things, too. Will they refer because of how you do it? Some will. But if clients have a clear understanding of why you do it they will tell their friends &ldquo;call my advisor &ndash; she&rsquo;s one of us. She believes what we believe.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Consider what you tell people when they ask what you do. Are you telling them what you do? </strong> <strong>  Or are you showing them why you do it? If they believe what you believe, they will be drawn to you and want to work with you. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> In 2007, in an interview with Charlie Rose, Steve Martin gave an often-quoted piece of advice. He said, &ldquo;When people ask me &lsquo;how do you make it in show business or whatever&rsquo; &hellip;I always say, &ldquo;Be so good they can&rsquo;t ignore you.&rdquo; The same holds true for success in content marketing. Focus on what you&rsquo;re doing, instead of how you&rsquo;re doing it, and your audience will come to you.</p><p> Steve also noted that this advice was often not what people wanted to hear. He said, &ldquo;What they want to hear is &lsquo;here&rsquo;s how you get an agent, here&rsquo;s how you write a script, here&rsquo;s how you do this&rsquo;&rdquo; Anyone looking for the easy way to write content that ranks well, connects with and delivers an audience is going to be equally disappointed.</p><p> <strong>  Simply no shortcuts </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s because there is no shortcut to being good. It takes practice, it takes hard work, and you don&rsquo;t get to be &ldquo;so good they can&rsquo;t ignore you&rdquo; overnight. This isn&rsquo;t to say you shouldn&rsquo;t learn about writing techniques, SEO basics, and study your craft. These are all ways you get better. It is to say that no single piece of information is going to catapult your content from blah to blammo.</p><p> <strong>  Focus is the key to creating better content </strong></p><p> Build your knowledge base, learn about your subject, and focus your time and effort on creating content that&rsquo;s interesting, that&rsquo;s valuable, and that your audience will want. A great idea in a wrinkled wrapper will win over a piece of recycled content in a shiny package every day. There&rsquo;s a big difference in spending time looking for shortcuts and spending your time focused on creating better content.</p><p> Shortcuts only work for a short while. It&rsquo;s virtually guaranteed that if you find some loophole or trick that gets your content to an audience or catapults you up higher in the search rankings, eventually that trick will stop working. And even when it does work, you&rsquo;re building a reputation for yourself as someone who relies on shortcuts. On the other hand, every time you produce a piece of content that&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s interesting, that offers something of value, you build a reputation for doing just that. Which will build your audience.</p><p> <strong>  Sometimes content is better than SEO </strong></p><p> Consider the success of  <u>  <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Oatmeal  </a> </u> . This site gets 5 million visits a month. It&rsquo;s comics, quizzes, and other funny stuff. And it&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s really good. The creator of the site was an SEO expert, yet his model for success is not based on his SEO skills.  <u>  In an interview </u> , he points out that his success is based on the &ldquo;humor and the insight in those comics and the utility of them.&rdquo; He focused on the content itself, on making it funny, useful, and valuable.</p><p> <strong>  Take a page from his book and focus on the &ldquo;what&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;how.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a sure path to getting better. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  It was Roy Disney who said, \"When your values are clear, your decisions are easy.\" </strong></p><p> Many retirement decisions aren't only tied to your values, they are also irrevocable decisions. This isn't the time to play it by ear. By planning ahead, and starting with your values, retirement decisions do get easier.</p><p> Work your way through these seven action items, and you'll be facing your own retirement planning with ease:</p><p> <strong>  1. Prioritize values </strong></p><p> Time and money are often interchangeable. You may be able to retire earlier, giving you more free time, but the trade-off might entail living on less. For some of you this is an acceptable trade-off. For others, it isn't.</p><p> Now is the perfect time to dig deep, and think about what matters the most to you. There are no right or wrong answers. This is a personal choice. When you are clear about your values, it makes money decisions far easier. It even makes spending decisions easier. If you have a clear goal in mind and a target monthly or annual savings number to hit, then it becomes easier to say no to less important items that may hinder you from reaching your goal as quickly.</p><p> Once you have clear goals, find pictures and written statements that inspire you. Put them somewhere where you see them every day. Who cares if your family or co-workers think you're a bit wacky. They&rsquo;re your goals, not theirs.</p><p> <strong>  2. Know your net worth </strong></p><p> Have you ever had to watch yourself on video? It's an uncomfortable feeling. Anyone who is in the entertainment field has to overcome this discomfort and learn to watch themselves over and over. This is how they improve.</p><p> This same discipline works for your finances. It can be uncomfortable to take an objective look at how much you have, how much you save, and how much you spend. If you want to improve this is a necessity. I started this practice years ago when I embarked on an effort to get out of debt. I tracked remaining credit card balances every single month. It was a powerful motivator to watch them go down.</p><p> For retirement, tracking starts with a net worth statement. This a list of what you own, minus what you owe. You'll want to update it each and every year. As an adviser, it is fun for me to go back 10 years and show my client's their net worth statements then versus now. People are often surprised by how much progress they&rsquo;ve made. You won't know unless you track it.</p><p> <strong>  3. Estimate your benefits </strong></p><p> Social Security offers financial features that cannot be purchased on the open market. Take advantage of this. The earliest age you can claim is 62, but you get a powerful boost if you wait and claim later. And if you're married, by planning together you and your spouse can take advantage of spousal benefits and survivor benefits. Survivor benefits function as a great form of life insurance, as the highest monthly benefit amount between the two of you is the amount that continues on for a surviving spouse, regardless of who passes first. By delaying the start date of the highest earner's benefit, you can be sure the survivor benefit is as large as possible,</p><p> The best way to estimate your Social Security benefits is to use  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/socialsecuritybenefits/tp/Best-Social-Security-Calculators.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  online software </a> . If married these programs will show you options for how you and your spouse can claim at optimal times to most effectively use your benefits. And if you are divorced, but have a prior marriage that lasted at least 10 years, don't forget that you have access to spousal benefits too.</p><p> <strong>  4. Get a handle on health care </strong></p><p> Too many people think Medicare will cover most of their health care costs once they reach age 65. Wrong. On average Medicare covers about 50% of your health care costs. The 50% that you pay will include Medicare Part B premiums (which are means tested &mdash; meaning the more income you have the more you pay), a supplemental policy, long-term care, and then there's dental care, eye care, hearing, copays, deductibles, etc.</p><p> When I run retirement expense projections I typically estimate about $10,000 a year per person for health care. This number can trend lower for those with retirement incomes under $75,000 and higher for those with incomes over $150,000. Of course you are already paying a portion of this now, as most people are paying at least a couple thousand a year in of out-of-pocket health care costs while working, so the incremental difference may not be as high as $10,000 a year. Your personal costs will also depend on things like where you live and how healthy you are.</p><p> <strong>  5. Make an income timeline </strong></p><p> In school I wasn't much of a history buff. I didn't like timelines as I couldn't see how memorizing the exact date of a bunch of historical events was going to have much relevance to my life. But future timelines are different. I love them.</p><p> A future timeline can be organized by month or by year. For retirement projections yearly is best. For budgeting purposes monthly works. You can use Excel or graph paper to lay out a timeline. Each column represents a year, and put in your expected income and expenses for that year and calculate the difference. This is a useful tool for laying out the varied start dates of sources of income, like Social Security and pensions, which may start midyear. You can also use it to account for periodic expenses, like a new car purchase, which may occur every few years, or only once a decade.</p><p> I use a monthly timeline for budgeting purposes so I know when to expect annual invoices for insurance premiums, home warranties, Christmas spending, and car repairs. I use a year-by-year timeline for retirement planning projections.</p><p> <strong>  6. Outline options </strong></p><p> There may be retirement possibilities you haven't thought of yet. Perhaps substituting a lower paying, lower stress job for a few years would work. In many cases this works if you stop contributing to savings during your lower earning years but don't start withdrawing yet. A transition to part-time work often works in the same way.</p><p> For some, a move to a different state can make a world of difference. This works if you live in a state with high taxes and high property values, and can move to a retirement tax-friendly state where you may be able to buy an equivalent home for less, freeing up home equity.</p><p> There are also options that involve reverse mortgages or annuities. These are viable strategies that, contrary to what many believe, can allow some to retire earlier, and often on more money.</p><p> 7. Determine your level of engagement</p><p> Are you going to do your own planning and investment management, or hire someone to do it for you? Either way, you need to gain a basic understanding of how things change when you near retirement and what new risks you face. At a minimum, you need to know enough to recognize good advice from bad advice. I'd suggest you subscribe to publications particular to those near retirement. I likeKiplinger's Retirement Report, or one of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/interpretingthene2/tp/Retirement-Blogs-10-Retirement-Blogs-Worth-Reading.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   top 10 Retirement Blogs  </a> </u>  I have listed on MoneyOver55.</p><p> Books are also a great resource. Many of my fellow  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/retirement/mentors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RetireMentors  </a> </u>  are experts in their subject matter and have written outstanding books that you can learn from. You are also welcome to a free download of the first chapter of my book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.controlyourretirementdestiny.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Control Your Retirement Destiny  </a> </u> .</p><p> If married, you also need to consider your spouse's level of engagement. You may be the money person, but how will your spouse fare when you are gone? It is cruel to leave an unsophisticated spouse to figure it out on their own. At a minimum do your research so you can tell them what kind of assistance they will need when you are gone, and how they can go about finding the appropriate resources.</p><p> Some of these steps may sound boring, and to be honest with you, sometimes they are. But the results they deliver &mdash; in terms of less stress and greater peace of mind &mdash; are anything but boring.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Bloggers. We&rsquo;re stereotypically an introverted bunch. All writers are for that matter! When you&rsquo;re cooped up in your office hashing out your upcoming novel of literary genius, you don&rsquo;t have to be bothered much by the outside world. But if you&rsquo;re a blogger, isolating yourself can have you missing out on some great opportunities.</p><p> Interviews! What better way to give your audience some great firsthand insight into your area of expertise than interviewing other professionals who are successful? I&rsquo;m a huge fan of doing interviews and let me tell you, people just eat them up.</p><p> <strong>  But most bloggers make a huge mistake when they decide to conduct an interview. </strong> They come up with a list of questions, email them to their interviewee, and wait for that person to type in their answers in an email back.</p><p> This is bad!! It&rsquo;s lame for several reasons. First of all, your interviewee will take forever to get back to you. I promise. Who has the time to type out the answers to all those questions?? Not me. Now asking for a half hour phone conversation, that&rsquo;s a different story&hellip;</p><p> Typed responses in an email have no interest, warmth, or character to them. Where&rsquo;s the spontaneity?? The spur of the moment humor?? Email takes out every humanizing element that makes interviews great. If you&rsquo;re going to do an interview, bite the bullet and do it the right way. Ask to schedule a half hour phone appointment. Most people are very happy oblige.</p><p> Does the thought of having a real live person on the other end of the phone scare the heck out of you? It shouldn&rsquo;t! If you&rsquo;re prepared, it&rsquo;s a piece of cake. And super-fun, I might add&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  So, how do you conduct this interview without making yourself look like a buffoon?? </strong> It&rsquo;s easier than you think!</p><p> <strong>  -Be Prepared:  </strong> This is the single most important element of a successful interview. Before conducting an interview, I spend at least a couple of hours scouring the internet for any info I can find. I read as many articles as I can, and any other past interviews they&rsquo;ve done to see what questions they&rsquo;ve already been asked. I did an interview just the other day and I happened to know how she met all of the other colleagues in her business. She was very impressed that I took the time to be prepared, and I believe it shows gratitude and respect for their time.</p><p> <strong>  -Lots of Questions:  </strong> While doing your research, take as many notes as you can, and come up with as many questions as possible. When you&rsquo;re reading interviews they&rsquo;ve already done, cross of questions that have already been asked or think of a different angle. You want your questions to be different. That&rsquo;s what separates your interview from all the others.</p><p> <strong>  -Control the Conversation:  </strong> When interviewing, you need to have a subtle way of controlling the conversation. It does take some practice, but a good way to start is to have your questions prepared beforehand in an order that makes sense. For example, plan to first discuss their early career, maybe segue into a hot topic, then finish out with future plans. But ALWAYS be prepared for the conversation to go in any direction. That&rsquo;s when it really gets interesting!</p><p> <strong>  -Be Aware of Time:  </strong> If you&rsquo;ve ever transcribed an interview, you know that listening to someone ramble is the worst! This is also a part of controlling the conversation. You&rsquo;ll know very early on if someone is a rambler, and you have to politely keep your interviewee on track or else you&rsquo;re going to have a 2-hour recording to go through. Not fun! You also want to make sure you get to ask all of your important questions without running out of time.</p><p> <strong>  -Did She Just Say &ldquo;Recording&rdquo;?:  </strong> Yes! Recording your interviews gives you the freedom to pay attention, be organized, and enjoy a free-flowing conversation. I like to use the <a href=\"http://www.tapeacall.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TapeACall </a>  App. I can even email the audio files to myself after for a backup.</p><p> <strong>  -Just Talk:  </strong> While talking to complete strangers may not come naturally to some people right away, the more you practice doing interviews, the easier it gets. I never want the person I&rsquo;m talking to, to feel like they&rsquo;re being interviewed. We&rsquo;re just having a fun chat about their favorite topic! It takes a lot of pressure off the both of you.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve never conducted an interview before, it can seem intimidating. I promise you, it&rsquo;s FUN! You get to talk to all kinds of interesting people and it&rsquo;s a great learning experience. Imagine getting to talk to the top SUCCESSFUL professionals in your industry and ask them anything you want!</p><p> <strong>  And I can guarantee those interview posts will be some of your most popular. </strong> Not only will your audience read them, but also the audience of the person you&rsquo;re interviewing. There&rsquo;s no better way to expand your following!</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the relationship between the   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/buyer-journey-advisors-care/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    buyer journey   </a>  </u>   and selling? </strong> (if you haven&rsquo;t read my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/buyer-journey-advisors-care/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   post  </a> </u>  on the definition of the buyer journey, make sure you read that one first before moving on.)</p><p> Well, as it turns out, the entire profession is changing and traditional selling and relationship techniques are becoming less effective because buyers are becoming more knowledgeable. In fact, they&rsquo;re coming to the table with more knowledge than ever before and it&rsquo;s making sales people too transactionally focused (i.e. order takers &mdash; please make this trade or please sell this fund).</p><p> <strong>  Understanding the journey can help you connect with your client or prospect on a much more fundamental level. </strong> If you&rsquo;re a financial or insurance advisor who excels, you&rsquo;ve likely adopted the technique of understanding your buyer&rsquo;s journey without even knowing it. When you connect with your clients or prospects throughout this journey, it will help you build trust. Why? Because each stage is buyer centric and not sales centric. The buyer doesn&rsquo;t physically buy or decide to buy until after they diagnosed their problem and are satisfied with their list of solutions to solve that problem. Asking for the sale too early, makes you disingenuous and breaks trust because you&rsquo;re just in front of the client or prospect for you, not them.</p><p> <strong>  What does this have to do with   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    AUM   </a>  </u>  ? What is the relationship between AUM and trust? </strong> Well, with my limited financial advice knowledge, AUM is basically all about the amount of money (measured in market value) that an investment company manages on behalf of investors. Is it safe to assume that the more trust that a client or prospect has with you the more they are willing to invest with you and thus increase your AUM? Well, according to Joachim I. Krueger, from Psychology Today,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/one-among-many/201205/money-and-trust\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   interpersonal trust  </a> </u>  is defined as the willingness to invest in another in hopes of being rewarded with reciprocity, while accepting the risk of being betrayed. According to this definition, increasing trust levels with your clients, enables a desire to invest in you as an individual and by doing so, they hope to be rewarded with, for example, the reciprocity of service, advice and financial gain and they accept the risk of loss. Higher trust = higher willingness to invest (i.e. higher AUMs).</p><p> <strong>  Here are 3 rules I follow when working your way towards serving your clients or prospects at each stage of the buyer journey: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Be helpful. </strong> If they are in the awareness stage, work with them to help them identify the complete picture of their symptoms. If they are in the consideration stage, send them helpful articles or connect them to people who might know more about problem they are experiencing than you do.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t ask for the sale too early. </strong> In the movie  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/media/rm660460544/tt0104348?ref_=tt_ov_i\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Glengarry Glen Ross  </a> </u>  you hear the term ABC &ndash; Always Be Closing. This only applies to buyers who are at the end of their buying journey. Yes, I know, you want to make the sale, you want to be the solution to your buyer&rsquo;s problem, but that might not serve the interests of your buyer and it won&rsquo;t help you establish trust. Asking too early could actually break trust.</li><li> <strong>  Be authentic. </strong> If they are in the decision stage, presenting them with 2 solutions you know they&rsquo;ll never choose and then your solution isn&rsquo;t authentic. Have confidence in your practice and business and place competitive solutions beside yours. It will help you weed out customers who might not fit your business and it will help you improve your services or products. Remember the relationship you are trying to establish and the types of individuals you are looking to acquire as clients. For example, clients who are price shopping (vs value shopping) will always choose the cheapest option no matter what. Even if you win their business today, they are bound to be troublesome and costly later.</li>",

    "link": "what-i-learned-from-my-friend-ernie-banks",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  \"Listen and learn!\" I was reminded of this simple, yet powerful concept when I had the chance to meet baseball legend Ernie Banks several years ago. </strong> For those who don't know him, he is \"Mr. Cub.\" He played for 19 years for one major league baseball team (Chicago Cubs), one owner, in one city, during one mayor, in one stadium, under one light - the sun. He is a member of the baseball Hall of Fame, The 500 Home Run Club and his number is retired from the Chicago Cubs and hangs on the foul pole in Wrigley Field.</p><p> <strong>  Mr. Banks is well known for his optimism and positive spirit. It is said that he coined the phrase \"Let's play two.\" </strong> A phrase he used every day there was a ball game to show his love for the game. It's worth noting that he played only day baseball in Wrigley Field (under the July and August heat) and he never won a championship with the Cubs. (But then again, no one has since 1908.) Banks signed with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League in 1950 and broke into the Major Leagues in 1953 with the Chicago Cubs as their first African American player.</p><p> When I first met Mr. Banks, it was one of life's little surprises. It came at a time that I had been pondering a concept I called \"regret minimization.\" The concept, simply stated, is doing those things in life that you think about but rarely, if ever, act on. That's when this meeting opportunity came to me. And, I acted.</p><p> Mr. Banks came to a client meeting on a rooftop outside of Wrigley Field. I did not attend the business event, but was delighted in the stories that were shared with me about him. A week later, a colleague called me and said, \"Hey, come meet Ernie Banks at 11 am Tuesday.\" I did, and for that opportunity, and the subsequent encounters we had, I am grateful. I am wiser and more optimistic because of my relationship with Mr. Banks.</p><p> Why am I wiser? I learned many powerful lessons through many great stories. One of Mr. Banks' lessons, in particular really stuck with me, even more so after I viewed the blockbuster movie \"42.\"</p><p> <strong>  42 </strong> , as you may know is the retired number of baseball great Jackie Robinson. Jackie was the first African American to break the all-white baseball barrier in 1947. The movie \"42\" does an excellent job of highlighting the absolute madness that Mr. Robinson encountered.</p><p> Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born in Cairo, Georgia in 1919 to a family of sharecroppers. His mother, Mallie Robinson, single-handedly raised Jackie and her four other children. They were the only African American family on their block, and the prejudice they encountered only strengthened their bond. From this humble beginning would grow the first baseball player to break Major League Baseball's color barrier that segregated the sport for more than 50 years.</p><p> In 1945, Jackie played one season in the Negro Baseball League, traveling all over the Midwest with the Kansas City Monarchs. In 1947, Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey approached Jackie about joining the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Major Leagues had not had an African American player since 1889, when baseball became segregated. When Jackie first donned a Brooklyn Dodger uniform, he pioneered the integration of professional athletics in America. By breaking the color barrier in baseball, the nation's preeminent sport, he courageously challenged the deeply rooted custom of racial segregation in both the North and the South.</p><p> At the end of Robinson's rookie season with the Brooklyn Dodgers, he had become National League Rookie of the Year with 12 homers, a league-leading 29 steals, and a .297 average. In 1949, he was selected as the National League's Most Valuable player of the Year and also won the batting title with a .342 average that same year. As a result of his great success, Jackie was eventually inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.</p><p> <strong>  So what did Mr. Banks tell me that I believe is helpful to us today? </strong> He shared with me what Jackie Robinson told him one day in 1953 when Jackie, while on a day off, visited Ernie at Wrigley Field in his rookie year. Jackie sought Ernie out and simply said, \"Just listen and learn, Ernie.\" I asked Ernie what he said back to Jackie. Ernie's response? \"Nothing, I just listened and learned.\" What vision. What strength.</p><p> <strong>  These words are so powerful. Perhaps if we desire more wisdom, better client relationships and greater production and results, we should \"just listen and learn\" more. Listen to our clients. Listen to our team members and get intentionally engaged in meaningful client relationships with purpose again. Just listen and learn - you may be pleasantly surprised by what you hear! </strong></p><p> I consider it a great privilege and joy to have had the opportunity to meet this courageous, joyful man. That experience and memory will last my entire life.</p><p> <strong>  Thank you Mr. Banks. Peace to your family at this time. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  At a press conference last week, </strong> the leader of an illustrious organization told reporters that, although he had no explanation for recent deflation, measures would be taken to prevent further deflation. For the New England Patriots football team, such measures include inflating game balls below quarterback Tom Brady&rsquo;s preference for the lower-end of the league mandated 12.5 to 13.5 pounds per square inch range.</p><p> <strong>  In the case of the European Central Bank </strong> , it means injecting 60 billion Euros into the economy each month in a new and expanded round of quantitative easing. Both efforts are inflationary and, according to some, necessary. While, as Brady explained, the deflated ball situation &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t ISIS&hellip;no one&rsquo;s dying,&rdquo; economic deflation has far more serious consequences. Global central banks have engaged in massive quantitative easing since Japan introduced the practice in the early 2000s. The ECB is arriving late to this solution largely due to resistance from the Germans caused by their fear of rampant inflation.</p><p> But The Economist and Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman both tell us deflation, not inflation, is the greater cause for concern, having provided the &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; soil necessary for <u>  <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/economic-history-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nazism to flourish  </a> </u> in the early 1930s. Why? If the money in your bank account will purchase more goods tomorrow than today without any effort on your part, why bother spending now? If the purchasing power of your savings account is going up, so is the value of the debt you must repay, another disincentive to go out and buy things.</p><p> <strong>  The result is flagging GDP mired in a downward spiral that Japan&rsquo;s experience proves is very difficult to reverse. </strong> Fear of deflation explains why the ECB announced additional quantitative easing, but the question remains whether it will be enough. Domestic interest rates are weighed down by global deflation, and until we see a meaningful increase in consumer spending domestically, and perhaps globally, the argument for higher interest rates will resonate less and less. </p><p> Sources: ESPN, The Economist, Bloomberg</p>",

    "content": "<p> The Mediterranean is a popular yachting destination owing to transparent blue water, lovely coastal villages, and delightful Mediterranean climate. Outstanding regional cuisine, accompanied by great local wines only enhances the experience. With popularity rising to its height in the summer season, competition for the best marina berths, secluded mooring spots, and quiet beaches runs large. There is, however, a place with all of the beauty and a bit less of the buzz in the stunning coastline of Montenegro.</p><p> Tucked in between Croatia's intricate coast to the north, and the Albanian coast to the south, Montenegro has quietly become the fashionable escape for many an exclusive yachting adventure. The glorious Bay of Kotor's 28 miles of fjord, the longest of all in southern Europe, leads to waters once sailed by ancient Illyrians, conquered by Romans, and peacefully existing today after a long, challenging history. Neolithic remains, Medieval villages, a modern superyacht marina, and busy beachside nightlife are rapidly earning Montenegro a status badge, but there is still much unspoiled territory to explore, with fewer crowds to invade the view. While you could spend two weeks simply cruising about the Bay of Kotor, there are several interesting destinations along  Montenegro's Adriatic coastline.</p><p> Our suggestion for seven delicious days departs from Porto Montenegro, reaching for a loop to the south, returning to Kotor. We are certain this itinerary will provide both a fabulous journey as well as unique talking points upon your return home, gathering envious glances as you retrace your route.</p><p> <strong>  Day 1: Settle into your splendid yacht in the lovely new superyacht facilities at Porto Montenegro. </strong> Cruise the Bay of Kotor, arriving at Kotor city and it's old town ramparts and architecture. This excellent natural harbor is home to many scenic, fortified villages set into the cliffs of the Balkan range, where magnificent mountains plunge dramatically into the bay. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1aMontenegro-3.jpg\" width=\"740\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 2: Admire the Bay of Kotor's stunning waters, with pretty bays and cliffside villages clinging to rock on your way to the city of Kotor. </strong> Step off the yacht to explore old town Kotor's churches, cathedrals, monuments, and authentic architecture. Refreshed, but allowed to gracefully show their age, the buildings of Kotor tell their story well. Great mountain backdrops provide stunning panoramas, and for those with the stamina to climb the steep 1,350 steps to the peak at the fortress of St. John, the view delivers vast rewards. The massive peaks provide a glorious view of the red tile roofs and whitewashed walls of the city against the blue waters of the bay. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1_3.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 3: Cruise back through the Bay of Kotor to Perast, past two pretty islands, St. George and Lady of the Rocks, each with its own beautiful chapel reflected in the smooth, clear waters of the bay. </strong> With the hill of St. Elijah as a backdrop, this lovely town shows its Medieval roots in art and architecture, as well as its romantic side. Beautiful cruising here around the islands makes for a leisurely day on the water, navigating back to the entrance to the Bay of Kotor at Herceg Novi. Dive the Blue Grotto caves, explore the 1,000 year old trees and ancient stone houses, and Arza Castle.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2_3.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 4: Cruising south along the coast to Budva, where beaches, monuments, shops, galleries, and the City Theatre welcome tourists and entertain locals. </strong> The Budvanska Riviera invites idyllic beach days in this ancient town with Illyrian relics dating back to the 5 th century BC. Also stroll the open-air markets for souvenirs. Known for its summer nightlife, Jaz Beach holds concerts with international rock stars, and the clubs stay open late to accommodate those on holiday. The lovely island of Sveti Stefan deserves a look, home to a beautiful upscale resort. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3_1.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 5: Cruise north back to Rose at the entrance to the Bay of Kotor. </strong> Tender in to Dobrec Beach, accessible only by water from the bay, for a charming visit to an old fashioned fishing community with an eye for capturing a small, select clientele.  Unspoiled and off the beaten track, Dobrec offers a relaxed visit with exceptional views.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4_0.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 6: Cruise the coast back to Tivot and Porto Montenegro, exploring islands, coastline, fishing, and diving. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Day 7: Disembark. </strong></p><p> Customized itineraries scheduling an additional week or two may include destinations along the coasts of Croatia, Albania, and Greece, or passage across the sea to Italy.

    "content": "<p> Trust begets trust. The best way to get your team to trust you is to trust them. Hire for trust. Require trust. Rid your team of untrustworthy players. And then, show your team how much you trust them. Here&rsquo;s how.</p><p> <strong>  1. Set Audacious Goals </strong></p><p> Oh sure your team may grumble. But there&rsquo;s no greater gift you can give your team than leading them toward head-turning results. Set the bar high and then look them in the eye, &ldquo;I believe in you. I know what this team is capable of. Now let&rsquo;s figure out just how, together.&rdquo; Show trust by believing it&rsquo;s possible.</p><p> <strong>  2. Tell The Truth </strong></p><p> Even when it&rsquo;s hard.  Don&rsquo;t sugarcoat the bad news. Play it straight. Show trust by treating them like grown-ups.</p><p> <strong>  3. Invite Them To Come Along </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ll never forget of my best first bosses, Gail. She would constantly take me along to senior level meetings, arguing that &ldquo;no one could explain it better&rdquo; than I could. Of course that wasn&rsquo;t true, she was one of the most gifted explainers I know. But she trusted I would do okay, and was secure enough to give up the spotlight. I&rsquo;ve been amazed at how many bosses are afraid to give such opportunities to their team. Show trust by sharing the stage.</p><p> <strong>  4. Admit What You Don&rsquo;t Know </strong></p><p> Show your team you trust them by admitting you don&rsquo;t have all the answers. Trust them with your concerns. Trust them with your questions. Show trust by being real.</p><p> <strong>  5. Encourage Them to Meet Without You </strong></p><p> This one took me a minute to get used to  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/results-execution/secret_meetings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (  <u>   you can read about that here)  </u> </a> , but a great way to show trust in your team is to give them a big hairy problem and ask them to meet to figure it out. Make sure that any information and parameters they may need gets out of your head and into theirs first, otherwise they&rsquo;ll spin their wheels. Show trust by getting out of the way.</p><p> <strong>  6. Tell Them </strong></p><p> This one might seem obvious or even silly, but I guarantee it can&rsquo;t hurt. Can you imagine how good it would feel to hear, &ldquo;I really trust you because_________.&rdquo; Show trust by telling them why.</p><p> <strong>  7. Forgive Them </strong></p><p> If your team screws up, talk about it, help them learn, and then move on. Show trust by letting it go.</p><p> Trust Across America has once again released their list of Top 100 Thought Leaders in Trusted Business Behavior. See the list (and lots of other great content) in their lastest online issue of  <u>  <a href=\"https://files.ctctcdn.com/2f93cf0e201/1bea0cd9-4b52-4e92-a516-23b343fc314b.pdf?utm_source=2015+Top+Thought+Leaders+Announcement&amp;utm_campaign=December+Trust+Sheet&amp;utm_medium=email\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Trust Magazine  </a> </u> . I feel very honored and humbled to be included with such amazing trust leaders.</p><p> Are you looking to build greater trust with your team? I&rsquo;d love to help.</p><p> <strong>  Your turn. What are the best ways to show your team you trust them? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> As I continue to stretch myself in different ways, I realize that there is no place for fear in my development. There have been times that I have been asked to give an important talk or presentation and as I&rsquo;m being asked to do this, I am ruminating about everything that can go wrong. Other times, there are unreasonable deadlines that I have to meet but nevertheless I am met with the discomfort of fear again.</p><p> One day, I sat quietly after being assigned a highly visible project and assessed my feelings. I was anxious, weary and annoyed. In effect, I didn&rsquo;t really fear the work but I feared the step outside of my comfort zone. Any step out of my comfort zone was a cause for fear and the fear was driven by the change. It was an Ah-ha moment! It wasn&rsquo;t really the fear that was eating away at me but the change. When I realized that was my issue, I worked feverishly to accept and become comfortable with being coaxed out of my comfort zone regularly.</p><p> <strong>  Go Home Change </strong></p><p> People like change when it suits them. They like change when it is the right time, place, and circumstance. Change that you can&rsquo;t see coming or that is untimely is the kind we loathe and try to fight against.</p><p> Things are changing in business, in society and in the workplace constantly- most of which fly under our radar, because it doesn&rsquo;t impact us. For the change that does impact us, we need to get over it, under it and around it, because there is ultimately no progress without change.</p><p> <strong>  Examples and more examples&hellip; </strong></p><p> Dunkin Donuts couldn&rsquo;t have thrived if it didn&rsquo;t decide to expand and improve its offerings after a decline in sales some years back. Sure you heard about Crumbs closing all of its bakeries, but do you know what change they made that has flown under most people&rsquo;s radar? They are selling pre-packaged cakes and cupcakes via BJ&rsquo;s Warehouse.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll give you one more. What happened to Kodak? They ruled the photo film industry for decades. In the boom of digital cameras and even more recent with smartphone cameras they were put out of their misery. Why? They didn&rsquo;t coax themselves out of their comfort zone early enough to keep up with the changes going on in the marketplace. Even with re-branding they were unable to regain traction because they ultimately feared changing what they had always done.</p><p> From these examples, we get clear examples of where the fear of change cripples us in our personal development and further damage the possibilities for your business to realize future successes.</p><p> <strong>  Will you finally let go of your fear of change? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Being a financial advisor has consistently been rated as one of the best jobs in America. And although that is good news for the industry, it means there will always be even more individuals joining the current lineup of brokers, financial advisors, financial planners, insurance agents, and banking and credit union financial professionals. For clients, however, they look around and there seems to be an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; everywhere. The key for any advisor today is to find a way to stand out and differentiate from all the rest in the increasingly crowded marketplace. <br/> <br/> One differentiator is the relationship that an advisor has with his or her current clients. The financial services business is, ultimately, a relationship business. We know that there is a direct correlation between the acquisition of referrals and the relationships that advisors have with their clients. Some clients simply want to introduce their friends, family and colleagues to their advisor.</p><h3> Your current clients will tell you what your differentiation is. Ask or formally survey your clients.</h3><p> <br/> However, if you ask or survey your clients and their responses are not that compelling, you may have to stop and figure out a new way of standing out as the extraordinary advisor that you really are.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Here are sample survey questions to ask clients to determine your differentiation: </strong> <br/> <br/> 1. How would you, right now, describe our organization to someone else who may have a need for our services?</p><p> 2. How have you described our organization in the past?  <br/> On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the best&hellip;</p><p> 3. We keep you fully informed.</p><p> 4. We do things right the first time.</p><p> 5. We are focused on quality personal service.</p><p> 6. We regularly provide information of value.</p><p> 7. We have adequate contact with you.</p><p> 8. Our employees go above and beyond for you.     <br/> Anyone in particular? _______________</p><p> 9. We make it easy for you to contact us.</p><p> 10. I would be willing to recommend your services to a friend or colleague.  Yes/No <br/> And here&rsquo;s a referral right now! ______________ <br/> <br/> Surveys can be done online using <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Survey Monkey </a>  for free, through a website form that clients can fill out, or by using the old school USPS. <br/> <br/> Your survey answers from your clients may give you exactly what you need to start clarifying your true differentiation. You are unique, of course, you just need to let those know that haven&rsquo;t worked with you yet what they will receive.</p>",

    "content": "<p> They say a dog is a man&rsquo;s best friend. As a financial advisor you&rsquo;re going to need more than a furry four-legged canine and a wet nose to help you navigate through the changes and challenges facing our industry.</p><p> As an advisor there is a long list of items demanding your attention: hiring new talent, attracting next-gen investors, communicating with clients, and offering up-to-date technology.  The list just keeps growing. Each of these challenges must be faced as opportunities to improve, implement new ideas, and determine what is working, and more importantly, what isn&rsquo;t.</p><p> One of the most effective ways to gain valuable insight into your practice is to organize an advisory board. Listening and learning from the observations and opinions from a diverse group of clients, prospects, and centers of influence will provide you with a valuable roadmap and prove to be profitable for your firm.</p><p> <strong>  1)      Choose Your Members:  </strong> Your advisory board should be comprised of a small but diverse group of eight to twelve clients, prospects, and centers of influence.</p><li> Use your  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/how-to-create-an-ideal-client-profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ideal client profile definition </a>  to help you select members and choose clients that will become evangelists for your firm while mentoring you as an advisor.</li><li> When forming your board, identify clients that can provide you with diverse skills, experience, and knowledge.</li><li> Ideal members of your board will be open-minded, thought-provoking, problem solvers, and have strong communication skills.</li><li> Ensure that your group includes members from varying generations. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2)      Identify Board Objectives:  </strong> Objectives should include but are not limited to:</p><li> Insight to product and business development</li><li> Marketing and technology</li><li> Research that encompasses emerging industry trends <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3)      Establish Expectations: </strong> Make sure you provide clear expectations to ensure board members know what is expected of them.</p><li> Be specific in communicating responsibilities and the areas in which you are seeking help.</li><li> Identify how often you will want to interact. A good starting point is every 6 months.</li><li> If private information will be discussed, inform advisory members they will need to sign a confidentiality agreement.</li><li> Consider having board term limits so as changes are needed board members and clients are not offended. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4)      Develop Board Relationships: </strong> Ask board members for their opinions and advice.</p><li> Establish a mentor/sounding board relationship.</li><li> Express your appreciation frequently.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t be offended if you hear something you don&rsquo;t like; your advisory board must be open and honest. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  5)      Prepare For Board Meetings: </strong> Your preparation for advisory board meetings is critical. Advanced preparations may include:</p><li> Solicit agenda items from your board prior to the meeting to prevent unplanned discussions.</li><li> Provide an agenda.</li><li> Host your meeting in a location that is free of distractions and stay on track by stimulating dialogue and having a results-oriented gathering.</li><li> Summarize minutes and include recommendations on key issues. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  6)      Compensation: </strong> Most board members are eager to serve and help firms and will usually not expect or inquire about compensation.</p><li> Consider making a donation to their favorite charity in their honor.</li><li> Make sure you comply with FINRA regulations. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  7)      Keep Board Members Informed:  </strong> Ensure your board members stay excited about your firm.</p><li> Provide company updates at times when you aren&rsquo;t asking for their advice. The fact that they&rsquo;ve agreed to be on your board means they care about your firm. Keeping them up-to-date will enhance their commitment to your practice, and in turn, help them be of greater value to you. <br/>  </li><p> Avoid apprehension; embrace the insight your advisory board offers, remove personal barriers or roadblocks, and empower yourself to experience positive change.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.camponeventures.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Madding King  </u> </a></p><p> If you are a founder struggling with turning around your startup and you have not seen  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/business/smallbusiness/a-reversal-for-indinero-a-once-struggling-accounting-software-start-up.html?_r=0.\" target=\"_blank\">   this recent   </a>  <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1KCxADB.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   New York Times article featuring Jessica Mah, CEO of InDinero  </a> </u> , do yourself a favor and check it out.</p><p> Mah, who founded  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.indinero.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   InDinero  </a> </u>  in 2009 when she was just 20 years old, shares how she transformed a drowning accounting software startup into a 75-employee business generating $3M in annual sales. InDinero is now on track to double their performance in 2015, and has raised a total of $8M from investors. So what can you learn from Mah&rsquo;s journey?</p><p> Here are 9 ways, inspired by InDinero&rsquo;s success, to turn around your startup:</p><p> <strong>  1) Admit You Have a Problem </strong></p><p> Metrics do not lie. It is essential that you stop, take an unemotional step away from your ideas, people, and dreams- and look closely at your hard numbers. Forget pipelines, forget &ldquo;if, then&rsquo;s&rdquo; and take critical inventory of the story your numbers are telling TODAY. If they are trending positively, great! If they are stagnant or falling, then it&rsquo;s time to preserve cash and make changes before it&rsquo;s too late.</p><p> <strong>  2) Make the Tough Calls </strong></p><p> If you are honest with yourself, and the numbers are not at least STARTING to head in the right direction, you have to slash costs. An actual &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; means to literally stop in your tracks- no matter how fast you are running- and change direction. In order to do this, you must make those tough calls for change. Sometimes that can mean checking your ego, closing down the fancy office, and trimming the fat. If you have to fire good people now to seek great people to help you execute later, do it. Swallow your pride, delete your overhead, and head back to the drawing board.</p><p> <strong>  3) Follow the Leader(s) </strong></p><p> Facebook improved on MySpace, Google improved on AOL/Yahoo, Uber improved on the taxi industry, etc. There is <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/12832347/1/airbnb-apple-tesla-disruptive-companies-that-put-a-hurt-on-competitors.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Airbnb, Tesla, Apple and more  </u> </a> . Take a look at the market leader in your space and really understand their unique value proposition. What are they doing that warrants such a huge valuation? How can your model provide a similar value? Imagine your business as a multi-million dollar enterprise. How can you refine your offering so that it mimics or improves upon existing successful ones? Maybe it is a shift in pricing, marketing, or that one critical feature that could catapult your startup onto the leaderboard.</p><p> <strong>  4) Perfect Your Pricing </strong></p><p> Evaluating your pricing sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to turning around your startup. However, I often see resistance, fear or confusion when it comes to price experimentation. Founders are constantly afraid of overvaluing themselves and risking buyer exclusion, or undervaluing themselves and getting crushed on their margins. Mah realized that the other SaaS leaders offered almost exclusive premium pricing options, and adjusted her initial $20/month software fees accordingly. Is your sales strategy based on targeting high-ticket big fish or getting a large quantity of customers at a more affordable price point? Knowing which direction to go can be the difference between year over year growth or burning through cash and hitting rock bottom. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t try to be everything to everyone- or you&rsquo;ll truly be nothing to nobody. Commit to an identity when it comes to pricing, and own it.</p><p> <strong>  5) Ask Your Customer </strong></p><p> When&rsquo;s the last time you spent months just talking to your target buyers about their wants, needs, dreams, and pain points? I do not mean sending out a stupid email survey or crunching social data about trends in conversations online. I mean actually one-to-one interviewing every potential customer to crowdsource the answers you need to improve your offering. When looking to evolve your model, sometimes just asking the right questions, forgetting what you THINK it should be and really listening is enough to get your company back on the right track. It is a slippery slope when you and your developers assume you know everything people want&hellip;and then find that your &ldquo;expert&rdquo; guesstimations have missed the mark. Make it easier on yourself and invest the time in real buyer due diligence.</p><p> <strong>  6) People Power </strong></p><p> When I talk to founders about what keeps them up at night, a large majority of them respond: &ldquo;Finding the right people.&rdquo; It seems that many times the top talent you want you cannot afford, or cannot manage, while the talent you can afford does not have the skill set or ambition to support your vision. It is the constant struggle of finding the dynamic people you need to propel your company to the top. And it is always a gamble.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/why-marissa-mayer-hired-henrique-de-castro-2014-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Look at Marissa Mayer of Yahoo, who went through a string of high-profile, multi-million-dollar-mistake bad executive hires  </a> </u> . It happens to the best in the business. Becoming better educated on the art of the interview process is a simple first step towards stronger hiring decisions. Start by reinventing your recruitment process and watch the caliber of your team rise accordingly.</p><p> <strong>  7) Time for You-Time </strong></p><p> And I do not mean downtime. Spending a portion of every week on your self-improvement is one of the most valuable time investments you can make. Like exercising your body, it is imperative that you exercise your mind outside of your typical company challenges. Mah read over 100 executive management books in the course of a year. That is about two books a week! If that is too intense for you, how about trying to finish one new executive management book a month? At least make sure you spend an hour a day reading quality entrepreneurial blogs on how to improve the way you strategically think about your business.</p><p> <strong>  8) Pro-Active Partner Protection </strong></p><p> Whether it is your co-founder, executive team, or your investors, approaching your business partnerships with a preventative mindset is key. Have you actually had those hypothetical &ldquo;What-If&rdquo; conversations to understand how each of you would approach future problem solving (before you get there and emotions are involved)? Mah and co-founder have a creative system in place from which you can borrow. When they disagree on an issue, they both assign the issue a 1-10 based on how important it is to them. Whoever assigns the issue a higher &ldquo;caring&rdquo; number gets to make the call.</p><p> <strong>  9) Keep Your Cool </strong></p><p> This is one of the hardest ones. Especially if you have had to blow up your entire concept and start over. It&rsquo;s natural to let your feelings of failure, embarrassment, or anger occupy valuable mental hours that you COULD be spending on moving forward in your new and improved direction. Not getting too high or too low, no matter how many millions of dollars are at stake or how the press or your circles have labeled you, is critical to reinvention. To turn around your startup, you must CALMLY channel all of your energy into one direction: improvement. You cannot afford to waste precious time on thoughts which do not serve this goal. Stay cool and keep moving forward, one day at a time.</p><p> Have you successfully turned around your startup in the past? How did you do it?</p>",

    "content": "<p> I had a fascinating discussion about fintech yesterday, and was intrigued with the briefing note for the meeting which said the following:</p>&ldquo;Fintech is the R&amp;D function of financial services in the digital age&hellip;.less to do with technology more to do with business model reinvention and customer centric design.  Fintech can be categorised as:<li> Traditional fintech as &lsquo;facilitators&rsquo; with larger incumbent technology firms supporting the financial services sector; and</li><li> Emergent fintech as &lsquo;disruptors&rsquo; with small innovative firms disintermediating incumbent financial services with new technology.&rdquo;</li>Fascinating.  Particularly fascinating as, a little like the debate around <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/12/what-is-a-digital-bank.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  what is a digital bank </a></u>, it begs the question: what do we really mean by &lsquo;fintech&rsquo;?<strong> I think of fintech as being a new market that integrates finance and technology.</strong>This new market is a hybrid of the traditional processes of finance &ndash; working capital, supply chain, payments processing, deposit accounts, life assurance and so on &ndash; but replaces their traditional structures with a new technology-based process.In other words, the term fintech describes a whole new industry.  It&rsquo;s a little like talking about retailers, and saying that Amazon is a retailer.  Are they a retailer or an ecommerce company or both?  I would claim that they are a digital service provider of fulfilment, but that&rsquo;s purely because they fulfil consumer orders as well as cloud-based service delivery through AWS.  In other words, they&rsquo;re not a retailer at all but a company in a whole new market place.In the same way, I don&rsquo;t think of fintech as an R&amp;D function of finance or as traditional fintech, as this is a new emergent market of digital finance that will, over time, displace the traditional financial markets.In particular, the idea of &ldquo;large incumbent technology firms supporting the financial sector&rdquo; is getting at the last century technology providers to banks, such as IBM, Unisys, NCR and co.  These are not fintech firms, but last century bank technology service providers.In addition, emergent fintech as companies that are &lsquo;disintermediating incumbent financial services with new technology&rsquo; may also not hit the mark, as some of the incumbents are becoming fintech companies and some fintech companies are providing services to incumbents.  For example, is Moven a fintech company?  Moven is partnering with TD in Canada and Westpac in New Zealand to enable those banks to offer  a cool front-end, so maybe not.  Does that make Moven a traditional fintech therefore, supporting banks and not disintermediating them?<strong> The reason I&rsquo;m picking up on this space is that I do care about being in a market that is new, fresh and vibrant.</strong>  A market filled with youth and new blood.  A market that rejects wearing ties and the tradition that goes with the suits.  A market that wants to rock the world of finance with technology.  That is the market that I think of as fintech.<strong> That new world is supporting, displacing and disintermediating the old world finance with technology.</strong>  It is recreating the world of finance with technology.  It is creating a 21st century world of finance based upon technology.  That to me is fintech.<strong> Fintech builds a new world of finance using a digital core that is IP-enabled. </strong>It sits hand-in-hand with the Digital Bank, as the new definition of finance and banking.<strong> Fintech is a new market. </strong>It is 21st century finance.  It is the new form of banking, and is related but very different to the old form.  Some of the old form players will metamorphose into these new digital fintech players.  Some, not all.   Some of the new players will take over the markets of the old incumbents.  Some, not all.What you end up with is a hybrid new market of IP-enabled financial firms including digital banks and digital insurers, who see their work completely through technology at the core.  That is the fintech world I want to work with.",

    "title": "A Confused Customer Buys Nothing",
    "link": "a-confused-customer-buys-nothing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annettefranz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Annette Franz  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Are your customers confused? Do you even know what that means? And do you know what the implications of customer confusion are? </strong> <br/> <br/> There's a marketing maxim that states:  <strong>  A confused customer buys nothing.  </strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>  This isn't a good thing, from a variety of angles. </strong> Think about that for a minute. And while you're doing that, let's start with defining what a \"confused customer\" looks like. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The following outlines how you can identify confused customers; they... </strong></p><li> Can't find their way around your store or your website</li><li> Can't find what they are looking for</li><li> Find what they're looking for but don't understand product details, pricing, or discounts</li><li> Have an issue with your product or service and can't understand why you can't resolve it</li><li> Don't understand your jargon</li><li> Think your products can do something they can't</li><li> Have too many choices</li><li> View your brand, products, or services no differently from your competitors</li><li> Don't understand the difference between your product offerings</li><li> Have too much information, none of which is or may be relevant to the task at hand</li><li> Have too much or the wrong information to make a decision</li><li> Don't have enough information</li><li> See inconsistencies in the brand, brand purpose, product, services, etc. </li><li> Find brand messages inconsistent with brand experiences</li><li> Don't understand what your brand stands for - what your purpose is <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Would you add anything else to the list? Does this describe what your customers experience? </strong> <br/> <br/> What does that mean for you? Well, just as the maxim states, confused customers won't buy anything. They won't return - at least not without a lot of effort from you and, perhaps, from their friends - and they won't recommend you either. On top of that, they develop this dissatisfaction that leaves a general bad taste in their mouths about your brand. <br/> <br/> <strong>  But wait. Why are customers confused? </strong> Yea, there are two parties to this equation! What are companies doing to create that confusion? They are...</p><li> Sending brand messages that are no different from their competitors'</li><li> Creating websites that are not clear and not easy to use</li><li> Making store layouts and displays convoluted</li><li> Developing pricing and discount strategies that require an MBA in Finance to understand</li><li> <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/08/innovate-dont-imitate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Imitating </a>  rather than innovating</li><li> Offering too many products</li><li> Creating line extensions that don't jive with the brand</li><li> Not training staff adequately to be able to answer customer questions or to address their issues</li><li> Speaking in jargon rather than in customer-friendly terms</li><li> Trying to be all things to all people; as a result, they aren't meaningful to anyone <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  What else are companies doing to create confusion for their customers? </strong> <br/> <br/> What should companies be doing to eliminate any confusion to begin with? There are some basic strategies and practices that ought to be in place to avoid customer confusion. Some of them begin with their employees and their own internal messaging: clarity is required for employees to know what is expected of them, both in their roles within the company and how what they do contributes and relates to the customer experience. That means that communication is probably the most important tool in order to provide clarity of:</p><li> Purpose</li><li> Vision</li><li> Values</li><li> Brand promise</li><li> Goals</li><li> Expectations <br/>  </li><p> When employees have clarity, it translates to clarity for customers, as well. Why? Because employee know-how and the employee experience drive the customer experience. They take their knowledge and clarity into everything they do, including developing brand strategies and communications, pricing and discounts, marketing messages, products, product information, websites, customer support experience, and more. <br/> <br/> Another way that companies can reduce customer confusion is to eliminate operational and process inefficiencies. The best way to do this is to inventory touchpoints, and map the journeys that  customers take for the various tasks that they are trying to achieve, products they are trying to buy, etc., and identify where the journey breaks down. From there, fix the operational and process issues that lead to confusion and pain. Think simplicity. Think effortless. Think ease of doing business. Think process improvement. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Are your customers confused? You want them to buy, right? So, how and where can you eliminate confusion for them? </strong> <br/> <br/> There&rsquo;s nothing worse than a sharp picture of a fuzzy concept. -Ansel Adams</p>",

If even one leg of the easel is of unequal height, or not standing firm and steady, the creation process can&rsquo;t commence. The canvas will fall and the paint will splatter everywhere.</p><p> The process of engagement is similar. Without full participation from all three legs of the easel, the &ldquo;work&rdquo; will often end in disaster. To ensure that your work/life canvas is on solid footing, everyone must be an active and willing participant in creating the masterpiece. That doesn&rsquo;t mean all three parties have the same role; in fact they each have distinctly different ones. It&rsquo;s how the collective work comes together that results in achieving the mecca of high engagement.</p><p> Painting is an art that goes back to the beginning of time, with some of the world&rsquo;s greatest masterpieces created by solo artists (think Michelangelo, Picasso, etc.). However, in our work lives it usually takes more than one person to bring a company&rsquo;s vision to life; it really takes a collective village with everyone having a distinct yet important role.</p><p> <strong>  Paint by the Numbers </strong></p><p> When I was a child, I was never very good at art projects. I remember my mom buying me a coloring book that had numbers on each page in different sections that correlated to a specific crayon. I couldn&rsquo;t go wrong. I had the formula to stay within the lines and choose the appropriate color. Thinking back to my corporate career, it was clear to me that for a long time I worked in environments that used an old school method of &ldquo;painting a masterpiece.&rdquo;</p><p> Businesses have always strived for three equal legs to stand on when creating and executing their vision. That was the cornerstone for most of my corporate career: two legs of the easel were immediately delegated to the roles of manager and employee. The third leg was assigned to the human resources department, which many see as the link between the manager and the employee. Traditionally, HR took the lead in ensuring that they handled employee engagement on behalf of the CEO and their senior leadership team. While this was going on, the executives stayed stationary in the picture frame (usually behind closed doors in their top-floor offices), letting the artists do the painting for them.</p><p> While this metaphorical easel was balanced from the standpoint of having all three legs assigned to these particular handlers, it clearly was not and is not the right formula for creating a masterpiece. Looking back at the old school way of thinking, the responsibility for engagement was definitely not a balanced equation. Employees had very little accountability for their own level of commitment and satisfaction in the workplace. Depending on two factors, managers had a varying degree of responsibility. These included:</p><li> their own level of personal engagement in the workplace and</li><li> whether or not others held them accountable for attaining high levels of engagement in their own departments. <br/>  </li><p> On the other hand, human resources professionals were quick to take ownership for engagement, falsely believing that it would give them a high degree of credibility if they lifted the burden from their already overworked managers. In truth, all they did was give the managers permission to pass on the responsibility for the critical role of engaging their people.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s new normal business environment, the old school methods that previously served generations so well just aren&rsquo;t cutting it. That&rsquo;s part of the reason why the number of people who identify themselves as disengaged at work is skyrocketing.</p><p> <strong>  Congratulations, You Are Now a CEO </strong></p><p> The world of work has changed and the future of the workplace looks quite different from that of prior generations. When we were all kids, the sky was the limit when it came to our future aspirations. Each and every day, parents indulged the fantasies of their children who felt they were destined to become firemen, police officers, nurses, cowboys, ballerinas, the next great entrepreneur, or even president of the United States of America. Many people even dreamed of becoming the boss of a publicly owned company or their own startup. Now, few realistically believe that will actually happen.</p><p> But I have some exciting news for you. You don&rsquo;t need to be the boss or CEO to change the world. What if I told you that as of today you are promoted? And I am not talking about a small step up the ladder either. As of today, you are being promoted to the role of CEO. Sounds exciting, right? Your first response may be to question my sanity and wonder exactly what I&rsquo;m smoking. The truth is I&rsquo;m not talking about becoming a chief executive officer. Who would want that stress and pressure? I&rsquo;m talking about promoting you to become a Chief Engagement Officer. This is a career goal that everyone must aspire to if we are to reverse the trend toward disengagement in today&rsquo;s society.</p><p> Engagement doesn&rsquo;t happen without ownership and hard work. It can&rsquo;t just fall on the shoulders of one person, but rather requires equal but different contributions from senior  leaders, managers, and employees alike. That&rsquo;s how to create the magic of an engaged and committed workforce. Thus, chief engagement officers provide an undeniable boost to morale and the ability for the entire workforce to reconnect and reengage in a more meaningful manner of doing business.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t always need an easel holding a canvas to paint a picture in the updated school approach to management. You can do it via technology and other new wave methods. What hasn&rsquo;t changed is that it still takes three equal legs to support our painting. However, what&rsquo;s different is that the people holding up the painting have changed. While managers and employees still make up two-thirds of the support system, now the senior leaders (including the real CEO) have taken responsibility for the third  leg, coming down from the frame (and from behind their closed doors) to be active participants in the quest for engagement. Each one individually cannot master engagement; it takes involvement from all three parties to create the masterpiece.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  We all know this lady, right? </strong> <strong>   Iconic Tina Turner </strong> had some insight when she sang, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s love, but a second-hand emotion?&rdquo;  When we think about our businesses, we&rsquo;re supposed to absolutely love what we do&hellip; right?  According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201502/jason-fried/whats-love-got-to-do-with-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jason Fried&rsquo;s article in Inc. magazine  </a> </u> , that kind of thinking might contain a little bit of BS.</p><p> I applaud  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jasonfried\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jason  </a> </u>  for challenging our way of thinking though.  If I&rsquo;ve said it once on this blog, I&rsquo;ve said it a hundred times:  I don&rsquo;t want a love fest, folks.  I want people to share different ways of thinking, feeling and experiencing our roles as financial service professionals. I happen to love what I do NOW, but I didn&rsquo;t at first.  There&rsquo;s the real truth.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;People tend to romanticize their own motivations and histories.&rdquo; </strong>  Jason points out in this article that opportunities come from challenges.  In theory, we pretty much have to NOT like something we&rsquo;ve experienced, to motivate us enough to change it and build on it.  That&rsquo;s what creates a successful business.  As we master it, we then can grow to love the difference we&rsquo;ve made, the career we&rsquo;ve built, but I have to give Jason accolades because he&rsquo;s right.  It&rsquo;s very rare that people wake up one day in love with an idea and say, &ldquo;Yep &ndash; I&rsquo;m building a business from this big ol&rsquo; beautiful love fest I&rsquo;m feeling and will stay in love with it enough to keep making a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;  Blech &ndash; that just doesn&rsquo;t even sound enticing at all!</p><p> For me, I didn&rsquo;t like the under-representation of the financial service marketplace on social media.  More than two years ago, I set out on a mission to change this perception.  I&rsquo;ve been blessed to work with thousands of financial advisors who have seen a difference in their business due to the work I&rsquo;ve done with them.  This has meant countless hours away from other functions that I had an interest in, but the challenge of making a difference, creating opportunities for them to be seen and to engage with people they would have never met otherwise has been the reward. The love grew over time and I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m doing what I do each day.</p><p> <strong>  So, what&rsquo;s love got to do with it? </strong>  It&rsquo;s second-hand to the difference we are trying to make in our respective community&rsquo;s lives. I am grateful for people like Jason Fried to challenge the status quo of long-time revered pieces of business advice to get us to see the bigger picture.  It&rsquo;s not love that should have anything to do with it, but a better understanding of WHY you want to do this and building on it.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lincolnmurphy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Lincoln Murphy  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  We have to be clear on the distinction between &ldquo;happy&rdquo; and &ldquo;successful&rdquo; when it comes to our customers. </strong></p><p> Happy is a feeling, successful is quantifiable. their customers have a goal, an ROI they&rsquo;d like to reach, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-desired-outcome\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Desired Outcome  </a> </u>  they need to achieve, etc. They&rsquo;re either on their way to hitting that goal or they&rsquo;re not.</p><p> Whether they&rsquo;re &ldquo;happy&rdquo; along the way isn&rsquo;t the point. If they don&rsquo;t reach their goal, if they aren&rsquo;t successful, they may be &ldquo;happy&rdquo; &hellip; happily looking for a vendor that will make them successful!</p><p> <strong>  Obviously I want the people I work with </strong> &ndash; my customers, clients, and partners &ndash; to be happy on a human level.</p><p> But I know that if they don&rsquo;t seem happy, are always pushing back on us, are asking for new features, for things to work differently, for more of this or that, and they never seem &ldquo;happy&rdquo; that this doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t successful or on their way to being successful.</p><p> In fact, customers who are engaged in multiple ways with their vendor are the most likely to stick around; the more touch points the better. There&rsquo;s a direct connection here, even if it seems counter to what you&rsquo;d think.</p><p> <strong>  For instance, someone that contacts support frequently </strong> &ndash; assuming they get their questions answered and issues resolve quickly (even if not with a positive result! That&rsquo;s the really interesting part.) &ndash; everything else being equal, is more likely to renew their contract or otherwise not churn out.</p><p> This makes sense when they consider that frequent support requests means they&rsquo;re becoming invested in the product and they&rsquo;re likely heavy, active users, or they use their product in ways it wasn&rsquo;t designed. All good signs.</p><p> <strong>  Very often, the most successful customers </strong> &ndash; those least likely to churn and likely to buy more over time &ndash; are their most demanding customers; they never seem to be happy&hellip; they&rsquo;re never satisfied. They always want more from their product.</p><p> It&rsquo;s actually customers they label as &ldquo;happy&rdquo; &ndash; the ones they never hear from or interact with, the ones that never complain or contact support &ndash; that are the ones to be worried about, if for no other reason than they don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re successful or not. They assume &ldquo;happy&rdquo; &hellip; and they assume &ldquo;happy&rdquo; means they&rsquo;re going to continue to be a customer.</p><p> None of those assumptions are based in reality.</p><p> In fact, those customers that you never hear from are the ones that they probably didn&rsquo;t set goals with or that they don&rsquo;t speak with frequently to know whether or not they&rsquo;re on pace to reach whatever the successful outcome is for a given timeframe.</p><p> <strong>  And the kicker is that very often these are the customers that </strong> &ndash;  <u>  according to product usage </u>  (they&rsquo;re &ldquo;active&rdquo; you know!) &ndash; might seem just fine&hellip; who then churn out &ldquo;unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p><p> But if they understood that happiness isn&rsquo;t the goal of the customer &ndash; success leading to loyalty is &ndash; then they won&rsquo;t fall victim to wrongheaded thinking when it comes to success vs. happy and they&rsquo;ll work diligently to create a health score for their customers so they can avoid these surprises.</p><p> <strong>  Solve for &ldquo;Success&rdquo; not Happy. </strong></p><p> I go into more depth on this idea in my article title  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gainsight.com/customer-success-best-practices/customer-success-not-happy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Customer Success is not about Happy Customers  </a> </u> .</p>",

Is the word risk appropriate for a retail audience? Does using risk help or harm your communications with clients? Does risk actually explain what risk actually means?</p><p> <strong>  What do we think? </strong></p><p> When investing, thinking about risk is essential. But when talking about investing, risk may not be the word you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p> Here are some of the risks that the financial services industry routinely employs in client communications: interest-rate risk, inflation risk, longevity risk, retirement risk, liquidity risk, political risk and credit risk.</p><p> When you say these words to retail investors, how do you think they will respond? With understanding or with fear? Caution or concern? It&rsquo;s hard to put a finger on it but, as Maslansky points out in his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Language-Trust-Michael-Maslansky/dp/1598597663/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387210783&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=language+of+trust\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   must-read book  </a> </u> , retail investors may be thinking that you&rsquo;re trying to instil a sense of fear.</p><p> Inciting fear isn&rsquo;t a great tactic to use on someone you are trying to educate, engage with and advise.</p><p> <strong>  Risk, however, is not a four letter word &hellip; or is it? </strong></p><p> We are not recommending you eliminate the word risk from your vocabulary, but it may be time to exercise a little restraint.</p><p> Instead of identifying the risk and leaving it at that, try explaining the impact the risk may have in a way your audience will understand. For example, when you&rsquo;re talking to a retail client about investing for retirement, consider replacing language like &ldquo;&hellip; managing longevity risk&rdquo; with an impactful statement like &ldquo;&hellip; creating an investment portfolio that will provide an income stream for as long as you need it.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Instead of identifying the risk and leaving it at that, try explaining the impact the risk may have in a way your audience will understand. </strong></p><p> Your audience will know what you are talking about. Instead of feeling frightened into action (Avoid the risk!), the retail client is invited to partner with their advisor to create a solid portfolio &ndash; a positive outcome for everyone.</p><p> While talking about risk may be one way to explain a situation, it may also scare away your clients or influence them to make decisions that aren&rsquo;t in their best interest.</p><p> Keep this in mind the next time you sit down to write a client-facing document, whether it&rsquo;s a  <u>  presentation </u> ,  <u>  regulatory document </u>  or anything in between.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The question of return on investment (ROI) naturally comes up anytime someone is suggesting you invest time and resources into a new marketing strategy or tactic.</p><p> <strong>  So why should it be any different for social networking? </strong></p><p> Well, there are a few reasons.</p><p> For one, social networking is not a mere marketing strategy and to see it as such is to misunderstand it &ndash; and it&rsquo;s ultimate value as an investment.</p><p> <strong>  Social networking is a means for communicating with people and extending relationships </strong> , the returns of which are rich and varied, including enhancement of reputation and trust, growth in audience and referrals, retention and engagement with existing clients, and of course, increased sales and new business.</p><p> Thus, when setting out to invest time and resources in social networking, it makes sense to have a set of relevant criteria that you intend to use to measure your &ldquo;return&rdquo; &ndash; not just how much new business did I generate.</p><p> Here are some suggestions for defining and measuring ROI from your investment of time and energy in social networking:</p><p> <strong>  1. Focus on people that matter to your business </strong></p><p> Make a list of clients and prospects you want to be on the radar with. Be specific and name names. Focus on valuable clients that are in your A group or friends of those A clients that you want to bring into your sphere of influence. If you&rsquo;re not connected with them already, make sure you connect on LinkedIn or follow them on Twitter.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t make excuses by telling yourself most of your top clients aren&rsquo;t active online. Even if 20% of your top clients are active online and you&rsquo;re not paying attention to them &ndash; someone else probably is.</p><p> There&rsquo;s lots of ROI associated with taking actions to add value and keep you top of mind with your clients that are spending time online. Look for ways to measure retention of existing clients and introductions to prospective new clients as part of your ROI.</p><p> <strong>  2. Develop new COIs </strong></p><p> Centres of influence (COIs) are a key part of any successful advisor&rsquo;s networking mix because they act as catalysts, introducing you to relationships and opportunities of great value to your business.</p><p> Nurture online relationships with your COIs the same way you focus on clients and prospects. Make sure you are connected to your COIs on LinkedIn and other social networks and pay attention to them. Each of your COIs has a valuable network within which there may be other valuable COIs.</p><p> When measuring your return, ask yourself how many new COIs you connected with and began nurturing as a result of social networking.</p><p> <strong>  3. Track engagement and reach </strong></p><p> Social networking is a long-term play. You&rsquo;re building an audience, not merely a lead funnel. It&rsquo;s a different way of thinking.</p><p> A lead funnel approach has you focusing on the most qualified leads and ignoring the rest. With an audience approach, you want to grow the size and reach of your audience because within that group are some highly qualified leads, some poorly qualified leads and some people who might never be leads &ndash; but they may be a referral source to a valuable lead.</p><p> Think like a media company when measuring ROI. Look for growth in your audience (more followers), your reach (more influential followers) and the engagement level with your content (more clicks, shares, replies, comments, etc.).</p>",

    "link": "science-what-to-say-to-get-your-way",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  We talk a lot about nonverbal techniques at  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    Science of People   </u>  </a>  , but there are some amazing verbal strategies you can use to master your people skills. </strong></p><p> Whether we realize it or not we are constantly pitching. We are pitching our ideas to colleagues, projects to clients or elevator pitches to others at networking events.</p><p> We want our pitches to be heard. We want to be persuasive. We want to be effective.</p><p> How do you speak so people will listen? I want to share a few easy tips and tricks to master the art of conversation and non-manipulative persuasion. When you know what to say to get your way, you can genuinely increase your influence and pave the way for smooth interactions.</p><p> <strong>  1. Start with Intention </strong> <br/> If you want to get your way you have to know exactly what you want. Far too often we go into a meeting or give an elevator pitch without thinking of our ideal outcome. Get in the habit of being intentional about your communication.</p><li> <strong>  Action Step:  </strong> At the beginning of every week, open up your calendar and set intentions for each of your meetings, networking events or pitches. You can either write your intention in the notes section of your event or set your intention mentally. Think about what your ideal outcome for that event would be. Do you want to land a new client, build rapport or simply make a good first impression? Knowing what you want before you start communicating will help you get exactly what you want. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Be Bold </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s hard to ask for what we want. Asking for what we want requires us to be vulnerable and direct and opens up the possibility of rejection. These fears creep into our asks and make us less bold with our requests. We beat around the bush, stall, add qualifiers and sometimes even ask in an apologetic tone. The problem is that when we are unclear about what we want, others can&rsquo;t get clear either.</p><li> <strong>  Action Step:  </strong> Next time you need to ask for something, use clear, concise language. Remove any disqualifiers like maybe, possibly or probably. Simplify your statements so that you are super clear with yourself and the other person on what needs to happen next. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3. Use Feelings </strong> <br/> In addition to being clear and direct about your intentions, you have to be able to get someone else to buy in. A central part of authentic persuasion is tapping into feelings. If you need more help on a project, share your feelings of being overwhelmed. If you are giving a pitch on a new business idea, share your passion. This brings both transparency and openness. I share some additional examples in the video above.</p><li> <strong>  Action Step:  </strong> Think about something that you need to ask for in the coming days. How can you add in your true feelings? Does the other person know why you are asking? Get in the habit of explaining your &ldquo;why&rdquo; in addition to your &ldquo;what&rdquo; to get your way. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4. Benefits </strong> <br/> Once you have explained what and why you need something, you need to share why they need it. People rarely do something if they cannot see the benefit to them. Whenever you are communicating with someone, be sure to keep their needs top of mind. You want to address their feelings and desires and address them before they have to ask.</p><li> <strong>  Action Step: </strong>  Think through some of the recent communications you have had. Make a list of what your needs and feelings were and then make a list of what the other person&rsquo;s needs and feelings were. Are they similar? Then ask yourself if both of those lists were addressed and how you could have done better. This process can help get you in the habit of addressing benefits in the moment. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  5. The When-Feel-Need Technique </strong> <br/> This last step puts everything together into an easy-to-remember communication formula called the When-Feel-Need Technique. This is a strategy you can use in any situation from business to social to romantic communications. First you address the context by starting with &ldquo;when.&rdquo; For example, I might say, &ldquo;When you don&rsquo;t clean the microwave in the break room&hellip;&rdquo; Then you want to go into your needs and feelings so they understand where you are coming from by saying &ldquo;I feel.&rdquo; Continuing with our example, this would be &ldquo;I feel frustrated that I am the only one who cares about office cleanliness and am being treated like a hired maid.&rdquo; Then you end by addressing the benefit to them and the next step &mdash; hopefully the intention you thought of in the first step. For example, &ldquo;We need to make the kitchen clean for all of us and make a cleaning schedule so we don&rsquo;t have to be bothered with this again.&rdquo;</p><li> <strong>  Action Step:  </strong> Try using this when/I feel/we need formula in your next conversation to see how powerfully it works to get everyone on the same page. <br/>  </li><p> Being clear and concise about your needs so that they are met not only makes all of your communication smoother, but it also makes you a pleasure to work with. The more you can appropriately address your own and other&rsquo;s needs, the better your relationships will be.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  In a videotaped experiment testing her financial cognition, an elderly woman must prepare three utility bills for mailing. </strong> She&rsquo;s seated at a table holding the bills, along with three filled-out checks, and three envelopes &ndash; each with one utility&rsquo;s name on it.  After considerable effort and confusion &ndash; checks paired with the wrong bills; bills placed into the wrong envelopes and taken back out &ndash; she finally finishes her task.</p><p> New difficulty carrying out simple financial tasks or understanding financial concepts that were once familiar can be warning signs of cognitive impairment due to aging, early stage Alzheimer&rsquo;s or other causes, said Daniel Marson, a neurology professor and director of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.</p><p> Financial skills are &ldquo;the canary in the coal mine from a functional standpoint,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you are seeing new problems in the checkbook or arithmetic errors, those are signs of an emerging disability.&rdquo;</p><p> Driving, for example, may not be affected as much early on, because it relies more heavily on motor memory. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to think about making a right turn or signaling,&rdquo; he said.</p><p> The chances of having Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease are slim for most older Americans; only one in nine do. Forgetting to pay a bill is more often just a sign of a bad day, and the inability to balance a checkbook or understand investments is not a warning sign if the person was never able to do so. To gauge whether the cognitive ability of a loved one or client may be in decline, the benchmark should be what he or she was able to do financially in the past &ndash; and whether that&rsquo;s changed over time.</p><p> At a recent symposium, &ldquo;Financial Planning in the Shadows of Dementia,&rdquo; Marson provided five financial warning signs, developed from his clinical work and research as a neuropsychologist. The warning signs are:</p><p> <strong>  Memory lapses: </strong></p><li> Forgetting to pay bills or annual taxes, or paying bills twice.  &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been very good about paying the taxes and then one year they just forget about it,&rdquo; he says. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Poor organization of information flow: </strong></p><li> A once-neat desk is now consumed by a sea papers or documents neatly arranged in binder clips have been replaced by a brown bag full of disorganized papers.</li><li> Disarray and confusion about what transpired when.</li><li> Mail that remains unopened for several months. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Math mistakes in everyday life: </strong></p><li> Once-proficient math skills aren&rsquo;t what they used to be.  It&rsquo;s suddenly a struggle to figure out the tip in a restaurant.</li><li> Increased difficulty working through the arithmetic details of an investment.</li><li> The person may need more help with the steps in a calculation. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Confusion: </strong></p><li> An erosion in the ability to comprehend financial concepts.</li><li> Failure to understand a term such as  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/primer-home-equity-%E2%86%92-retiree-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;reverse mortgage&rdquo; </a>  that was understood a few years earlier. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Impaired judgment: </strong></p><li> A new interest in get-rich-quick schemes.  A classic sign is that the person would not have considered the scheme five years ago and is now listening and interested.</li><li> Thinking they have less money than they do.  Developing an unrealistic anxiety about one&rsquo;s finances, even if they&rsquo;re in good standing.</li>",

Begin each meeting with a firm handshake. Know your target market.</p><p> Regardless of your success practices, you must underscore your systems with one very important &ndash; and often overlooked &ndash; attribute:courage.</p><p> It takes courage to start a business, to run a company, and to stay active and innovative amid our constantly-changing work environment. It also takes courage to put yourself out there, day after day, to share your gifts with the world.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t seeing the results you&rsquo;d like or you find your energy waning, you may be due for a courage boost. <strong>  Start with these tips: </strong></p><li> <strong>  21 Days Of Courage. </strong> Eleanor Roosevelt sagely advised us to do one thing every day that scares us. In terms of forever, that might seem overwhelming &ndash; but how about as a 21-day project? Each day for the next 3 weeks, make an uncomfortable but important call, speak up, say YES to an opportunity. Keep track of your courageous leaps in a journal for future inspiration.</li><li> <strong>  100% Belief. </strong> It&rsquo;s not enough to think you have a great product or service; you need to know this with 100% certainty. For instance, if you develop a cure for a disease and you meet someone with that disease, are you going to withhold that information because you don&rsquo;t want to seem pushy or &lsquo;braggy&rsquo;? Of course not. When you believe in your gift 100% and know you can make a difference in someone&rsquo;s life, that will fuel your actions &ndash; and your courage.</li><li> <strong>  Brave Role Models. </strong> Whose courage do you admire? Adopt the attributes that resonate with you into your own leadership style. Reach out to your role models and ask for ideas (they&rsquo;ll probably be flattered!). Your goal isn&rsquo;t to copy, but rather to gain fresh perspective, strategies, and inspiration. <br/>  </li><p> Remember: You are already courageous or you wouldn&rsquo;t own a business, so we&rsquo;re not starting from scratch here. Build on your courage foundation in meaningful, purposeful ways such as those mentioned above. You will reap the rewards not only in business, but in life!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichelFalcon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Michael Falcon  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Is customer service average in most industries because we, as consumers, complain too much? </strong> <br/> <br/> For example, take into account your own personal experiences as a consumer. Do you contact a company to acknowledge their great service as quickly as you do when you&rsquo;ve received bad service? <br/> <br/> I recently came across a Venture Beat  <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/12/social-media-we-complain-879-million-timesyear-and-facebook-is-our-top-target/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u>  that highlighted a couple of interesting customer behaviour statistics:</p><li> <strong>  Collectively, we complain about brands an astonishing 879 million times every year on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media networks </strong></li><li> <strong>  32.8% of complaints are ignored by brands </strong> <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Have we trained employees to expect complaints and be surprised by praise? </strong> If that&rsquo;s the case, how motivating is that? <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s human nature for adults, teenagers, and children to want positive reinforcement. Whether it comes from your spouse, family, or friends, it feels good to be told that you are doing well &ndash; I believe it motivates you to &ldquo;double down&rdquo; on those efforts.  <br/> <br/> I think that if we, as consumers, want customer service to improve, then we must make a greater effort to acknowledge great service. We can do this by tweeting the company, calling the employee&rsquo;s manager, filling out customer surveys, and more. <br/> <br/> I&rsquo;m trying to get better at this practice myself. The other day, the delivery person from a pizza chain in Canada delivered my pie in record time. Not only that, he was extremely polite and did his job very well. I knew that this company never formally asked for feedback, but I could not let this employee&rsquo;s efforts go unnoticed, so I took the initiative to call the company and express my gratitude. I picked up the phone, asked to speak to the call centre manager, and explained to him why my experience was so positive. I made it very clear that I wished for my feedback to be both recorded within their CRM and sent to the franchisee who employed this employee. To be honest, it felt great doing this and it even hit me with a wave of nostalgia. The nostalgia came from my memories of working within a contact centre and experiencing first-hand what it was like to have customers praise my efforts &ndash; it felt good then, and it feels even better now.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Am I going to change customer service around the world by doing this? </strong> Not at all. Regardless, by doing so I may inspire that employee to continue providing great service again and again, which only serves to benefit myself, as the consumer, with a better customer experience. <br/> <br/> One thing I work on with companies looking to improve their customer and employee experience is how they handle customer feedback after they have received it. In most cases, companies will buy software, ask for feedback, then cross it off their to-do list. Along with analyzing and taking action on the feedback, you must also ensure that a system is in place to take positive comments and share them across the organization. What&rsquo;s the point of exhausting your efforts of asking for feedback if you&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;let it live in a virtual store unit&rdquo;? As an employee, receiving recognition for good work can be a great motivator to continue performing at a high level. <br/> <br/> <strong>  I recognize that most brands aren&rsquo;t very good at responding to complaints. </strong> Based on my experience as a consultant, I see that it&rsquo;s often because we are understaffed and don&rsquo;t reinforce service-level agreements. I recommend that all complaints should be resolved within one business day. If you don&rsquo;t have the workforce to handle this, it might be a good indication that you should find the budget to grow your team. After all,  <u>  <a href=\"http://michelfalcon.com/customer-complaints-good-business-money-isnt-everything/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer retention  </a> </u>  is a central focus within your business, right? <br/> <br/> On another note, we complain faster than we congratulate because we have become cynical through being accustomed to receiving poor customer service?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Like many self-help junkies, I like to read up on all the latest theories of growth, behavior, and happiness. Unlike most people though, I like to test them haphazardly on myself, my loved ones, and on innocent bystanders. I do this for 3 reasons:</p><li> I like tangible, real world applications</li><li> I don&rsquo;t like to use my clients as guinea pigs</li><li> I still hold onto the belief that somewhere out there is a magical, concrete theory that would explain my past mistakes, adorably neurotic behavior (yes, that&rsquo;s how I describe it) and would generally make sense of the world around me. <br/>  </li><p> While #1 and #2 have been helpful, #3 has gotten me into a bit of trouble. See, the problem with trying to &ldquo;find yourself&rdquo; is that you do a lot of unnecessary pathologizing, diagnosing, and, to put it bluntly, a lot of thinking.</p><p> <strong>  The truth is that thinking isn&rsquo;t always a good thing.  </strong></p><p> Sure, thinking is helpful when you&rsquo;re debating that 3rd drink, 3rd slice of pie, or 3rd glance at Facebook in 5 minutes. But, for those of us who are bright, anxious, or bored, we engage in what I like to call the intelligence dilemma. Simply put, it&rsquo;s the desire to over-think things into oblivion. </p><p> <strong>  Let me give you an example. </strong> Earlier in the month, my boyfriend left for a long trip to London. After dropping him off at the airport at 8pm, I returned home to:</p><li> Organize my closet</li><li> Write out my quarterly and yearly business plan</li><li> Write an article for Lifehack</li><li> Listen to a Tony Robbins lecture</li><li> Redesign my website <br/>  </li><p> Needless to say it was the wee hours of the morning until I shut my laptop and crawled into bed. While some might see this productivity kick as a blessing, I chose to see it a coping mechanism. I decided that my brain was protecting itself from feeling pain by overworking instead of missing him.</p><p> <strong>  I started worrying. </strong> Was this going to be my new go to way to escape my feelings?  <br/> Was I going to have to join one of those Overworkers Anonymous Groups? <br/> Was I going to be the kind of person who needs an IV drip of coffee and a Bluetooth headset implanted in my brain?!</p><p> As I began my spiraling descent into crazy town, I caught myself and asked, &ldquo;what would I say to a client going through this?&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;d likely say, &ldquo;Is this in any way hurting your life? No? Then why are you questioning it?&rdquo;</p><p> As anyone who has previously employed/enjoyed a poor coping mechanism knows, there&rsquo;s always the fear that we are running away or not doing enough to face our demons. This fear is fueled by all the self-help tips to feel our emotions and question our behavior. (Yes, I know I&rsquo;ve shared that exact advice before, just go with me on this.)</p><p> <strong>  While that&rsquo;s often right, here&rsquo;s the thing we often forget: If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it. </strong></p><p> Whatever you look for is what you will see.  If you&rsquo;re determined to believe you are crazy, not only will you believe it, but you&rsquo;ll start to act in a way that confirms it. Leave the diagnosing to the professionals and let yourself feel free.</p><p> <strong>  When you start to over-think, ask yourself: </strong></p><li> Is what I&rsquo;m doing getting in the way of my health or happiness?</li><li> Am I hurting anyone?</li><li> Am I likely to regret this? <br/>  </li><p> If not, then just let it be. You&rsquo;ll get the answers you need in time. The path to Enlightenment isn&rsquo;t a sprint and doesn&rsquo;t happen on your timeline. So chill out. Stop thinking. And just enjoy it. </p><p> As for me, there&rsquo;s plenty of time to miss him. And til then, I&rsquo;ll just embrace and enjoy the work that I love.  And I&rsquo;ll take it one step further: In an effort to stop over-thinking, I&rsquo;m not going to edit this post. May the grammar gods forgive me and my typos. But hey, you gotta start somewhere. Also, I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  We each develop patterns in our writing. </strong> Using a few familiar article formats, for example, can help us efficiently produce new content and our readers learn what to expect from us. However, sticking to the tried-and-true pattens can also lead to stagnant, uninspired content.</p><p> Switching up the types of articles you write or the media you typically produce could be just the challenge you need to create fresh and inspired content.</p><p> <strong>  15 ways to frame your content </strong></p><p> We scoured the web to develop this list of suggestions for content formatting &ndash; some are very basic (our tried-and-true) and some we&rsquo;ve never seen in practice (and we are excited to try them out).</p><li> <strong>  Lists: </strong>  As seen in this article, lists are a simple solution to present information in an easily- scannable format for readers.</li><li> <strong>  Tutorials (how to):  </strong> Teach your reader how to accomplish a task or meet a goal with easy to follow steps. No task or goal is too simple for a how-to. The daily tasks you easily perform can be daunting to a first-timer.</li><li> <strong>  Problem to solution: </strong>  Similar to how-to articles, identify a problem your readers or clients frequently face and provide solutions.</li><li> <strong>  News jacking:  </strong> If a topic in your industry is making the news, capitalize on it by writing about the subject, providing a unique take on it or personalizing it for your clients. Hubspot offers many blog article templates, but the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CFsQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsocialchacha.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fthe-newsjacking-blog-post-template.doc&amp;ei=Y2s8U6a7MMm4yQGR9IHIBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiCxUm2fiT977_p5Jz_hk8uclndg&amp;sig2=JD2nrI\" target=\"_blank\">   news jacking blog template  </a> </u>  is helpful as you learn to write this type of article.</li><li> <strong>  Challenges: </strong>  If you are participating in a self-imposed challenge or one issued by a business or blogger, share your progress with your readers. Or, issue a challenge to your readers and ask them to share their experiences. A great example is a reader challenge issued by Good Financial Cents to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/how-to-break-bad-habits-replace-with-good-one/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   break bad habits in 21 days  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Roundups:  </strong> Compile your favorite news and web links in your industry into an article. Our favorite examples are the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.trafficgenerationcafe.com/weekly-marketing-news-march-22-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Weekly Marketing Skinny  </a> </u>  by Traffic Generation Caf&eacute;, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kitces.com/blog/category/12-weekend-reading/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Weekend Reading for Financial Advisors  </a> </u>  by Michael Kitces.  Roudup articles are best received when published regularly: weekly, monthly or quarterly.</li><li> <strong>  Interviews: </strong>  Interview an industry leader, author, fellow financial advisors or bloggers. Share their stories in an easy Q&amp;A format. This not only confirms the authority of your sources, but helps establish the credibility of your site.</li><li> <strong>  Reviews: </strong>  Evaluate new products or resources. Examine new books, e-books, white papers and share your thoughts.</li><li> <strong>  Multimedia: </strong>  Using a new media can certainly stretch you to make more inspired content. If you haven&rsquo;t already, share a photo gallery, produce a simple video or podcast, offer a Slideshare or webinar. You may find a new favorite content medium!</li><li> <strong>  Case study: </strong>  Write a case study and offer it as a free PDF download when readers enter an email address.</li><li> <strong>  FAQ or SAQ:  </strong> Write an article comprised of the questions you most frequently hear from clients. No doubt others are curious to know the same information. A unique way to present this information is a SAQ (should ask questions) article, which lists the questions clients should be asking about services or products, but aren&rsquo;t. Both formats are a great introduction to someone shopping for your services.</li><li> <strong>  Checklist: </strong>  A cross between a list and how-to article, a checklist provides a list of materials needed or steps to accomplish a goal or task. An example could be, &ldquo;Your Retirement Plan Checklist.&rdquo; Bonus points for providing the checklist as a downloadable, printable document.</li><li> <strong>  Infographics: </strong>  Have infographics run their course?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/rosscrooks/2014/01/14/are-infographics-still-effective/\" target=\"_blank\">   If the content is strong, the infographic can be effective  </a> </u>  according to Forbes. Do the research, then hire a graphic designer or create your own with loads of free infographic-specific images at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Canva  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Questions/survey/poll: </strong>  Asking your readers to participate in a poll or survey or to participate in an online discussion not only gives you a better sense of the type of content your readers want, but when you share results and analysis, you provide your readers with more information about their peers and industry.</li><li> <strong>  Timeline:  </strong> A timeline can be an incredible storytelling tool. Share the history of your business or a product you offer. Tell the story of why your industry came about and what needs it serves today.</li><p> <strong>  Assess responses to your new content </strong></p><p> Using new article formats or media may stretch us to produce more inspired content, but if our readers don&rsquo;t respond well, it may be time to try something else.</p><p> Use your analytics tools to determine the content that receives the best response. Was the topic well received? What role did the format or medium used play in that response? You may have to experiment a bit to better understand what your readers appreciate.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  A New York-based Registered Investment Advisor who specializes in financial planning and investment management, and manages $180 million in assets, asked us to review and evaluate a long-term care (LTC) policy that a client had purchased. </strong> <br/> <br/> The client, a 65-year-old man, had purchased the policy in 2012.  </p><li> The basic benefits of the plan were  <strong>  $6,000 a month </strong>  for long-term care expenses for  <strong>  up to 3 years </strong> ;</li><li> The policy began with  <strong>  yearly premiums of $2,800, but these premiums go up every year </strong> , in exchange for annual cost of living increases of 3% added to the basic monthly benefits;</li><li> Due to the these scheduled premium increases, the  <strong>  client would eventually be paying over $16,000 a year in premiums by the time he was 84. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> We used financial modeling to analyze the policy within his financial plan and found several warning signs. We evaluated the client&rsquo;s assets under three assumptions: 1) no LTC claim, 2) a permanent claim in 10 years and 3) a permanent claim in 20 years. Without LTC insurance, the clients assets depleted before age 100 under a claim scenario. However, the existing policy&rsquo;s premium increases became a financial burden over time to maintain the benefit. The client had enough assets to assume some risk associated with a claim and needed insurance to balance the risk.</p><p> <strong>  We looked to see if we could find a long-term care plan that made more financial sense for this particular client </strong> . We were able to provide him a plan that offered the following:</p><li> <strong>  $3,500 a month benefits for 10 years </strong></li><li> A built-in inflation rider to cover cost of living increases without premium adjustments</li><li> <strong>  Level premium costs of $4000 a year </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The new policy cost over 22 years is $88,000 versus $178,282...a $90,282 savings.</p><p> The financial modeling on this plan put the client on very sound footing going forward and ensured that his financial plan will succeed, whether or not he suffers a long-term care situation. This case study just shows how having experts evaluate your clients&rsquo; long-term care options can save them a great deal of money, while also ensuring that they are getting a plan that will provide them with the type of solid coverage they may need one day.</p>",

    "link": "advisors-sales-metrics-what-are-we-really-measuring",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a consultative business development specialist my clients often ask me to provide metrics on my sales efforts. Fair enough, but what do they really mean? In too many cases metrics are used to measure quantity of activity rather than progress.</p><p> For me it's always important why we measure and to work toward an objective. What's more important for you? - Keeping nice, neat spreadsheets with lots of entries that might please the CEO or results that reflect a meaningful process and real progress toward closing sales?</p><h3> <strong>  Does Quantity Matter? </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is this widely-held misconception that quantity in sales is the key to success.</p><p> It's important, but only when it is tied to a process. It's certainly not THE key to success. If it were, all those high volume sales callers would be way ahead of the pack.</p><p> First of all, we need to understand who our ideal prospect is, what industry they live in and why they would want to buy from us.</p><p> Secondly, we need to find the decision maker/buyer within the target company and then we can start counting. It is meaningless, in my opinion, even wasteful to pick up the phone or shoot off an e-mail to just any company in your CRM without understanding who they are and why they would be a good fit. You might get lucky and make some progress, but it will take a long time to actually gain traction.</p><h3> <strong>  So, how many calls should I make? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sales metrics, as my experience has shown me, should be tied to results and to results only. It really doesn't matter how many phone calls, e-mails or marketing touches you make. All that matters is that every action you set will take you a step closer to closing the sale. Activity is important but only if it's streamlined, targeted and measured against a clear objective.</p><p> A sales person who makes 500 client touches a week and never gets to go on a qualified sales presentation or meeting will most likely never make a sale. On the other hand, sales people who work smart will research a great deal, find out about their prospects and then make fewer calls, followed by well written customized emails. And these sales people will open up doors faster. These are sales professionals who employ consultative selling strategies.</p><h3> <strong>  The SMART Funnel </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is a reason why we compare the sales process to a funnel. So, in a cutting-edge version of the funnel, we start with a large (or wide) number of potential prospects, and then we tighten the funnel with research. Every interaction with the targeted prospects will lead to tightening the funnel more. And if planned and executed well, will take us a step closer to a sale. Yes, quantity is important when keeping your sales funnel full, but all the activity in the world will not help you close if you don't work toward and measure actual results.</p><h3> <strong>  Reports or Real Results? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Whenever my clients ask me to provide results reports, I always ask them what they plan to do with them. I ask questions like: Do you hold your sales people accountable for setting up a follow-up meeting after the first meeting? What is planned to happen after the first meeting? Are there next steps arranged? Do we know more about the prospect than we did prior to the meeting? Do we know the decision-making and purchasing process? What is the budget cycle? Who is the decision maker? Who do they currently work with? And so on.</p><p> These are questions that not only help qualify a prospect further, but are also essential to compiling data for future prospecting. Don't ask your sales people to just put numbers on a spreadsheet.</p><p> Make sure the numbers show progress in developing business, deepening business relationships. The numbers should show a path to increased revenue and not just increased activity.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  I have learned the hard way that most of the improvements I have made in my personal and professional production come when I regain some form of consciousness. </strong>   That is, when I pay close attention to others, when I notice things and situations, when I ask questions, listen and genuinely become interested again in people. As I mentioned in my last post, curiosity is a good thing!  I further believe that this state of awareness occurs when we practice purposefulness and intentionality.</p><p> The first time I met Ernie Banks, I spent uninterrupted, joyful conversations about several topics. As I mentioned in a previous blog post, he is \"Mr. Cub.\"  Ernie played for 19 years for one team, one owner, in one city, for one mayor, in one stadium, under one light - the sun.  He is a member of the baseball Hall of Fame, The 500 Home Run Club and his number is retired from the Chicago Cubs and hangs on the foul pole in Wrigley Field.  He is well known for his optimism and positive spirit.</p><p> It frustrated me to have to end the meeting.  But as we were walking out of a chic skyscraper in the Chicago Loop, marble floors, gold-plated light fixtures and well-dressed security guards, we stepped onto an express elevator on the 44th floor to go to the lobby. I saw it right there, first hand, with my own eyes - this man's passion, wisdom and compassion. His spirit and optimism...his gift!</p><p> I held the elevator door for Mr. Banks and the two other unknown individuals who were joining us on the elevator for the direct decent to the lobby.  The first was a young African American woman; I thought she was in her late 20s. The other was an African American man, I'd say early 30s.  They were followed onto the elevator by Mr. Banks (early 80s) and then finally me (a white, nearly 5o-year-old man). I just stood and noticed.  The young man looked up at Mr. Banks (very recognizable in the city of Chicago) and went back immediately to his Blackberry without a word.  I was not sure if he recognized him or not.  The young woman didn't look up at all.  I said nothing.</p><p> Then the elevator silence was broken.  Mr. Banks said to this young woman, \"You look like you have something on your mind.\"  \"Excuse me?\" she said, still looking down in that very popular elevator position.  I took uncomfortable notice. \"You look distracted, young lady,\" Ernie retorted.  She added, finally looking up, \"I have a very long commute today, sir.\" </p><p> \"You need to get home to that baby of yours\" Ernie replied. \"Sir, my baby is 19-years-old now,\" she said.  Mr. Banks shot back with a smile, \"He's always your baby and he needs you now.\"</p><p> I watched as her eyes welled with tears, she again, now softly, looked up at him, smiled and said, \"Yes, he is. Thank you, sir,\" just as the elevator doors opened and she walked out.  Her step was now noticeably quicker and with a huge, beaming smile.</p><p> This old hall of fame baseball player in the less than thirty seconds lifted this woman's spirit in a way that I will never be fully capable of explaining.  What a joy to witness! I felt better just being around him. It helped me to begin to believe in society, in people again and in the power of a gentle spirit of optimism and availability.</p><p> <strong>  Do you want to know how to raise the bar for yourself, your organization and society? </strong> Act on the wisdom, wit and wealth of the \"so called\" silent generation.  Believe! Believe in someone, something and see what it does for you and the people around you - the people you serve. Act like Mr. Cub, Ernie Banks and you will change the world - one person at a time.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently visited a store to make a return. I suspect that few people relish this particular type of retail encounter &ndash; not the employees, not the customers. Both sides often seem prepared for a debate at best and an argument at worst.  It is an unexpected relief when the experience is seamless. The product I had purchased failed to meet reasonable expectations. Something you would expect to easily last a year or more wore out in a very short span of time. Sales receipt in hand, I headed to the counter.</p><p> It bears mentioning that this retail brand has a reputation as a customer service leader. The manager looked at the item that I have brought back and asked how often I had used it. This question surprised me. Does my answer impact the fate of this return? She goes on to say, &ldquo;As a courtesy, we&rsquo;ll refund your money this time, but this is what we consider normal wear and tear.&rdquo; At that juncture, she opined that the particular item I purchased doesn&rsquo;t last as long as others like it&hellip;</p><p> Was my mission accomplished? Yes. I was issued a refund. Did I feel cheerful about the experience? Hmmm. The manager&rsquo;s approach to the return was accusatory and the permission to allow me to return the item seemed more of a gesture to appease not a commitment to reasonable customer satisfaction. I heard a warning that my &ldquo;bad customer behavior&rdquo; would be tolerated once and only once.</p><p> Invariably, some customers are emotional, erratic or unreasonable in their requests. Often the best we can do is try in earnest to help that customer walk away feeling whole. Sometimes the simplest word choices and &ldquo;presumptions of positive customer intent&rdquo; can help those who frequent our businesses walk away feeling more valued than when they approached. In my case, the manager could have simply and graciously said: &ldquo;Thank you for taking the time to bring this back to us and share your concerns about its durability.  We value the opportunity to make it right. Sorry for your trouble.&rdquo; The manager knew she was going to take my return, per the store&rsquo;s published and customer-facing policies.  But the policy seemed to be something she was working against and that she endured it in the context my brief interrogation and resulting placation.</p><p> So take a look around your business this week and ask yourself: Are my staff members openly or reluctantly securing customer loyalty through a gracious and grateful response to customer issues? What barriers can you eliminate to make service recovery effective, pleasant, and loyalty building?</p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Documenting the progression of our employees&rsquo; training, performance and development is critical for managers because documentation provides independent and objective evidence of what happened or what didn&rsquo;t happen. </strong></p><p> Somewhere along the way, howver,  documentation has become the way managers &ldquo;built a case&rdquo; against employees to prove cause to demote or terminate for poor performance. As a result, employees have become suspicious and uncooperative with the performance documentation process. They either refuse to participate or refuse to sign off on anything they perceive as negative because they don&rsquo;t want bad things going in their permanent record. They don&rsquo;t care that they have a right to add their comments to the forms. They don&rsquo;t believe their signature is an acknowledgement and not agreement to the contents. They simply do not trust that management isn&rsquo;t planning to use the information against them at any more to justify an employment decision that will adversely impact them in some way.</p><p> <strong>  They are usually right. </strong></p><p> As managers, we are generally conditioned to handle documentation this way. I&rsquo;m guilty of it as the HR person. I&rsquo;ve had countless conversations with managers about the importance of documenting negative performance trends &mdash; and I&rsquo;ve had just as many conversations with managers about how their failure to praise their employees is causing low morale, dissatisfaction, turnover, etc &hellip; We chastise managers for failing to give consistent praise and positive feedback &mdash; but we don&rsquo;t hold them accountable to document it the way we do for the negative stuff.</p><p> If our goal is to correct inappropriate or non-productive behavior so employees truly improve instead of turning over, we&rsquo;ve go to change this. If our goal is to redirect off track employees onto the right path, we&rsquo;ve got to change this. If we want our feedback and review processes to have real meaning and value, we&rsquo;ve got to change this.</p><p> <strong>  How? Simple. Document the good. </strong></p><p> Not simple emails or pats on the backs but true documentation. Take time at least 3 times each year to outline the positive behaviors and results of the consistent and outstanding performers among your employees.</p><p> <strong>  That way, when/if negative feedback comes </strong></p><li> It will not be a surprise</li><li> It will not completely cripple or discourage the employee</li><li> The employee will be much more receptive and responsive feedback. <br/>  </li><p> The only time employees have documents to sign shouldn&rsquo;t be when they&rsquo;re hired, fired or when something is wrong. By adding in documentation on positive performance trends alongside whatever corrective documentation is needed, you&rsquo;ll create trust with you employees, set the atmosphere for truly productive feedback and assemble a historical records that illustrates the totality of performance.</p><p> <strong>  That&rsquo;s the case worth building. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  In his   <u>   WSJ article, wealth advisor Paul Hynes  </u>   points out that financial advisors can spot and do something about financial elder abuse. </strong>  He comments that financial advisors are in a unique position to observe their clients over years, sometimes decades.  Knowing a client well gives them the vantage point to understand their clients&rsquo;  normal general life situations as well as their patterns of using their accounts.</p><p> I agree with Mr. Hynes that advisors are well positioned to spot red flags in their clients&rsquo; lives and any unusual activity in their accounts.  He suggests that advisors can contact Adult Protective Services if abuse is suspected. Here is where I question his advice as falling a bit short.</p><p> As part of the national legal community dedicating time to the protection of vulnerable elders I see communications from lawyers all over the U.S. with complaints that Adult Protective Services are not taking financial elder abuse seriously enough in many places.  When it is reported, APS may dismiss it as &ldquo;a civil matter&rdquo; in which they have no interest.  APS is essentially an investigative help to the criminal justice system. It can intervene when an elder is in physical danger. Social workers and investigators from APS look into reports of abuse and help the DA determine whether there is evidence sufficient to prosecute a crime.  If the matter involves the undue influence of a family member and the elder seems willing to give away money, even if duped into doing so, APS is unlikely to take any action.</p><p> <strong>  Financial advisors cannot rely on the average community&rsquo;s APS to protect their clients when abuse is suspected. </strong>  Particularly in the case of family, close associates, and caregivers, APS may not wish to interfere unless or until an obvious crime has been committed. Many of these abusive situations are not so obvious, or the elder appears to be willing to give away his assets, and he may not see that anything is wrong. it is up to others to work to stop the abuse, including financial advisors, who may be in a highly trusted position with the elder.  </p><p> The financial services industry, generally, has avoided certain kinds of communication with family of aging investors due to privacy laws, concerns which they interpret as precluding them from sharing financial information.  I do not agree that privacy should stop advisors from communication with family when an elder clearly needs protective action.  There is a way around the privacy question.  Policy can be created to obtain permission from every client to communicate with a family member or trusted other appointed to step in when the advisor (and compliance) have reasonably concluded that the elder is being taken advantage of financially or otherwise.</p><p> <strong>  If you see something, say something&rdquo; is what we are supposed to do to stop terrorist attacks.  It is also what we need to do to stop elder financial abuse. </strong> The financial  industry needs to develop new, forward looking, senior specific policies to address what Hynes correctly points out as the rampant problem of elder abuse.</p><p> Here at Aging Investor, we are doing our part to help by developing educational materials for industry professionals.  We want every professional to recognize the red flags warnings of potential abuse, to understand diminished financial capacity and to  how to get the necessary document in place around the issue of privacy. Aging expertise from outside the financial services field is needed for all of these points.  I hope all advisors, their compliance departments and organizational heads will pursue what FINRA has urged on you since 2008: that senior-specific policies be put in place to stem the rising tide of elder financial abuse of their own aging clients.</p>",

    "title": "How To Pitch Yourself—And Your Content—To New Media",
    "link": "how-to-pitch-yourself-and-your-content-to-new-media",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  A year after I started my first company, I got a big lesson in using media. </strong> I&rsquo;d hired a publicist to help us build our authority as experts and&mdash;ultimately&mdash;bring us new clients. When she asked for my dream goal, I blurted &ldquo;the cover of the Wall St Journal&rdquo; since that was the biggest &ldquo;get&rdquo; I could imagine.</p><p> Suppressing a laugh, she explained that would be the ultimate stretch goal and I should adjust my sights. Not two months later, there we were, featured in a cover story about small firms making big waves.</p><p> The only problem? Being profiled in The Wall St Journal was more about stroking my ego than being the perfect perch to pitch clients. Our story was syndicated and ran in about 50 local news outlets. I spent the next six months fielding inquiries from consultants looking for work. Total number of hours invested: countless. Total number of new clients: zero.</p><p> <strong>  So trust me. The first lesson in pitching media is to know your end goal. </strong> Who do you want to reach? Be very specific about your target (if you&rsquo;re not sure,  <a href=\"http://www.rochellemoulton.com/developing-your-client-avatar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  try this exercise to get clear on your perfect client  </a> ) What do you want your audience to think, feel and do after they&rsquo;ve experienced you in the media?</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve got deep enough pockets to buy yourself a well-connected media team, you may well be able to dive right into the deep end of the pool.</p><p> But the beauty of new media is that you can own the keys to the kingdom. You can organically build your own coverage. And here&rsquo;s how you do it.</p><p> <strong>  LAY THE GROUNDWORK </strong></p><p> Frankly, an awful lot of those pitching have gotten lazy, failing to do even the most rudimentary research before dashing off a self-centered email. Even just a little bit of thoughtful preparation can jettison you to the top of the list of harried reporters, editors and bloggers.</p><p> <strong>  Once you&rsquo;re absolutely clear on your target audience, you need to find out where they congregate. </strong> What do they read? Who do they watch? Where and how do they take in their information?</p><p> I challenge you to go beyond the usual suspects that everyone in your niche is bombarding. Get creative. Search on your keywords and check out up and coming bloggers who will resonate with your message. They are often desperate for good content and a little homework will tell you what they value most: guest blogs, articles, interviews, podcasts, digital summits.</p><p> Spend some time at this&mdash;you may well have 20 or even 30 possibles before you can start whittling down your list to your perfect-fit targets. If you&rsquo;re new to this, think training wheels. You want to build a media target list of no more than 10&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll be able to better focus with just five. Have your dream outlet(s) in there for inspiration, but be sure it includes some easier wins. Your goal after all is to get your message out and build traction.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve got your list complete, zero in on the writers, reporters and editors who cover your beat. Do your homework the same way you&rsquo;d prep for a sales meeting: what do they care about? What kind of content do they publish? Tip: troll their site and/or bylines to find their written (and unwritten) rules of engagement. Your pitch needs to fit THEIR platform, not the other way around.</p><p> <strong>  CRAFT YOUR PITCH </strong></p><p> Consider starting with a piece of content for an outlet that routinely accepts outside submissions. Choose wisely&mdash;you want a post that is custom-edited for their audience and point of view.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll vastly increase your chances of success if you draft your pitch (email) like you&rsquo;re wooing an important prospect. Make it about them&mdash;their needs, theirdeadlines, their audience. Make it a no-brainer for them to say yes.</p><p> <strong>  And then&mdash;the hardest part&mdash;WAIT. </strong> Contrary to popular opinion, sending multiple follow-up emails doesn&rsquo;t increase your chances of being published. It&rsquo;s more likely to get your name on the spam list. So cool your jets for three business days and politely follow-up (adding your follow-up to the original message so s/he doesn&rsquo;t have to search for it). If you still get no response, drop it. Move on to the next target on your list. Rinse and repeat.</p><p> If you still have no takers, don&rsquo;t be discouraged and especially don&rsquo;t take it personally. Rejection happens more often than the wins, even to media stars. Take a breather and then shop your next piece of content, being sure to give that prospect at least a month between pitches.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;re getting your content regularly published in your strategically targeted venues, you should start seeing the results you aimed for. How can you continue to build your authority in the media?</p><p> <strong>  GET YOURSELF QUOTED </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s much easier to make yourself sought-after for media quotes when your on-brand, thought-provoking articles are published on a handful of influential media platforms. Reporters on deadline searching for expertise will find you quickly since articles on these highly trafficked sites will pop up higher on search engines and social media.</p><p> But of course, you&rsquo;d like to make it move more swiftly than simply hoping they&rsquo;ll find you. So as you take off the training wheels, slowly add to your targets list the reporters and bloggers you most want to influence.</p><p> <strong>  A word. A little empathy and respect for reporters&rsquo; deadlines and editors goes a long way. </strong> When one says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running this story and my deadline is 3PM&rdquo;, they aren&rsquo;t messing with you. Bend yourself like Gumby to accommodate them. First callback can get you the primo quote when two or three sources say essentially the same thing.</p><p> Be prepared to look at courting new media as an investment in relationships. You may give background several times before they actually include you in their story. Groaning about it only takes you out of their first-call queue. So suck it up and be generous.</p><p> <strong>  Oh and save the marketing-speak for anyone but a reporter. </strong> Talk to them like a real person&mdash;give them facts and figures when you can and don&rsquo;t be afraid to take a controversial opinion. They&rsquo;ll love you for it. Even if they don&rsquo;t quote you, you&rsquo;ll be on their must-call list next time.</p><p> Organically building your influence and authority isn&rsquo;t quick (assume 12-18 months of consistent, focused effort), but it does have pretty impressive staying power.</p><p> <strong>  The best part? You can start right now. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  For the past few years I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work alongside an amazing man, Warren Rustand, as part of the Entrepreneurs Organization Leadership Academy. </strong> When I was asked to join the faculty for this event, Warren&rsquo;s position as Dean of the Academy was used as a bargaining tactic; I was promised that my experience with him would change my life. And so it did.</p><p> Warren and I immediately connected around our interests in both practicing and preaching concepts related to energy management and peak performance. But what drew me most to this man was his ability to be fully present in the moment with the person who was in front of him. While it seems like a simple thing to do, I have only had this experience twice in my life, where I could sense someone&rsquo;s ability to be that connected and grounded in the moment, reaching out to fully grasp the shared experience of giving energy to another.</p><p> While his resume is overly impressive, having played professional basketball, worked in the White House and run massively successful organizations, it was Warren&rsquo;s connection to giving the best of himself in each moment that continues to inspire me to be a better person. Having taught along side Warren, I know how he would guide us to living a life fully lived: practice the power of purpose and create a life of discipline. </p><p> Using what I&rsquo;ve learned from my work at Synergy along with techniques shared by Warren, I&rsquo;ve created a new morning jumpstart for myself. This doesn&rsquo;t replace my &ldquo;high five&rdquo; routine, but it does allow me to get the process started. Immediately upon waking up, I&rsquo;ve begun to ask myself 3 questions to help shift my brain to a positive focus:</p><p> <strong>  #1 &ndash; Why am I alive today? (Thanks to Warren for this one.) </strong></p><p> This first question helps me consider who I want to be before determining what I want to do. It also helps me focus more specifically on today, rather than letting my mind race with concerns about the bigger future. </p><p> <strong>  #2 &ndash; How can I serve? </strong></p><p> Bringing my focus to an even more targeted effort, these words speak to me on a deeper level. I believe my purpose in life is to serve others to the best of my ability. But that can feel overwhelming when I look at the big picture, especially when I start comparing myself to others or becoming judgmental of my efforts. I think only about the day ahead, and think about the small moments where I&rsquo;ll be able to serve others by giving my full and best energy. </p><p> <strong>  #3 &ndash; What do I really want? </strong></p><p> <strong>  In this final step I think about what&rsquo;s most important to me. </strong> Coming back again to purpose, and my desire to serve others, I notice that what I really want most is deep connection with others. This requires emotional vulnerability, faith and love. At the foundation of everything I do it is these core values that drive me, and when I think about them and how important they are for me, I feel inspired to get up and take the steps required to give myself the best chance for success. Not success in a financial or materialistic way, but success at being more like the person I want to be and believe I have the potential to be if I keep moving in the right direction. Staying mindful of the power of my brain to either push me towards my goals or unintentionally pull me off course. </p><p> <strong>  By focusing my mental energy on what matters most to me, I can then step into the daily routine that I know will prepare my brain to support me in accomplishing a presence that enables me to have meaningful connections with others. And the more I connect, the more I am inspired to connect, and the more I sense what it is I most long for &ndash; love. </strong></p>",

But despite all these amazing newcomers, I always wondered&hellip;how the Private Banks are coping with these changes?Clients are getting more educated than before, having a strong desire to be involved in their investment decisions with an increased level of security, so how do Private Bank match their demands?  <a href=\"http://www.chappuishalder.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Chappuis Halder &amp; Cie </a>  &ndash; a consulting firm dedicated to the Financial Sector with offices in Geneva, New York and Singapore to name a few &ndash; has published a great presentation on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ThibaultLEPOM/chciedigital-in-private-banking\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rising importance of Digital in Private Banking  </a> </u> ; see below a few key points. <strong>  &ldquo;Leverage on Technology enablers to keep ahead of the Game&rdquo; </strong> For more than a decade, smartphones and tablets have considerably changed the way we communicate and consume products and services. No matter where we are or what time is it, the world is ours at a finger touch. E-glasses, connected watches and &ndash; in a not so distant future &ndash; biotechnological devices will have an even stronger impact. All 24/7 connected, these devices collect a massive amount of data helping marketers to better understand how we consume products in order to better address our needs. Just like any retail banks, Private Banks have a great card to play bringing better services and relations to their customers. Just like any business, innovation rather than improvement, is the key! <strong>  &ldquo;Borrow ideas from accross the world to trigger innovation&rdquo; </strong> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   KickStarter  </a> </u>  (a popular crowd funding platform),  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mint  </a> </u>  (personal finance management) and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etoro.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eToro  </a> </u>  (Forex trading platform where users can follow the best traders&rsquo; move) are some of the most famous startups connecting the greatness of the internet to the financial world. Besides, we see an increasing number of industries being shaken by our usages of new technologies;  <a href=\"http://www.airbnb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   AirBnB  </u>    </a> provides a great alternative to hotels and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Uber  </a> </u>  brings taxi to the 21st century. Innovation is all around and successful Private Banks, instead of improving their current business model, will completely re-think it as well as their client&rsquo;s relationship (from product-centric to client-centric). <strong>  &ldquo;Focus on uses, get into the life of the users&rdquo; </strong> In October 2013, PwC published an amazing paper on how  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/publications/viewpoints/unlocking-big-data-value.jhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial Institutions can leverage of the power of Big Data  </a> </u> .  Big data is indeed a gold mine for all Financial players; greater focus on customer centricity, improved customer risk analysis, higher customer retention, improved ability to introduce new products and services, and so much more! Despite big data, it is of a major importance to carefully keep track on how the usages of some services are being changed by the internet; not only it can give you ideas for innovation, but it tells you a lot on what people are expecting in terms of relations. More educated than ever, an increasing number of clients want to have a direct control over their investments, live updates with offers and propositions dedicated to their own lifestyle. <strong>  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think only about Finance, user&rsquo;s life is much bigger!&rdquo; </strong> My sales mentor,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.davidmasover.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David Masover  </a> </u> , taught me one thing &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put the light on you, but on your lead&rdquo;. Because Trust is the key for any business relation, it is of a major importance to constantly focus on how client&rsquo;s are living day by day, what are their problems, their challenges and more. A successful entrepreneur, investing in different assets, might probably be interested in privileged investments into carefully selected startups. Instead of focusing only in Finance, be a business partner of your client to help him in all his activities.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In my article called &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/do-financial-advisers-really-hate-your-wife-2014-01-13\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Do Financial Advisers Hate Your Wife?  </a> </u> &rdquo; I explained a discussion I had with  <u>  Dan McGrath </u> , one of the authors of &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Dont-Know-About-Retirement/dp/0985082097/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389621533&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=what+you+don%27t+know+about+retirement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What You Don&rsquo;t Know About Retirement Will Hurt You!  </a> </u> .&rdquo; <strong>  Dan&rsquo;s point was that the traditional approach of financial planning for retirement and beyond is flawed given many of the realities and impacts of health-care costs on living well in retirement and one&rsquo;s later years. </strong> &ldquo;The rules for retirement have changed and advisers have been slow to adapt to these new rules and thus we see many seniors, particularly women, get hurt financially as they need to adjust to the new costs that no one helped them to plan for,&rdquo; McGrath says.In the last article Dan painted a scenario that a widow may encounter after the loss of her husband. The widow is now faced with lowered income overall including less Social Security income along with increased health care costs due to her age and health and lack of long-term care coverage. In Dan&rsquo;s scenario, the adviser held to the age-old approach of spending cash and non-qualified assets first. <strong>  Dan says, &ldquo;this is a scenario that is occurring every day in this country. </strong> The last part about having all of her non qualified assets spent first, including her Roth, is particularly troublesome given the means tested nature of Medicare. It&rsquo;s very similar to what happened to my mom.&rdquo;In fact, in the  <u>  book </u> , Dan discusses a conversation that he had with his mother, who felt that her son was able to address her financial planning needs and she would be in good hands. What Dan discovered is that the new rules of retirement require an approach that many advisers have avoided and one that he feels they need to utilize to help investors going forward. <strong>  This new approach would have addressed Dan&rsquo;s scenario with a different strategy. </strong> &ldquo;While the couple was alive and implementing a retirement financial plan, I&rsquo;d include products such as life insurance with LTC riders for each of them along with a LTC product such as Lincoln&rsquo;s MoneyGuard or Pacific Life&rsquo;s PremierCare. I&rsquo;d also start using those precious tax deferred assets once they reach the qualifying age, while allowing the cash, the non qualified assets and the Roth accounts to grow, &rdquo; Dan says.He goes on to recommend what he feels are two things that most advisers avoid for clients and he feels that they should be considered given the new rules of retirement: opening a home equity line or Reverse Mortgage to allow access to potential income, and use some of their non qualified assets to purchase a Single Premium Immediate Annuity the year they retire. <strong>  How would this have changed the scenario? </strong> Dan reveals, &ldquo;When the husband gets sick, the LTC is triggered, allowing her to hire someone to tend to him and helping her maintain her health. The life insurance kicks in to supplement the lost Social Security income when he passes away. Along with paying her bills with her cash, non qualified assets and Roth assets, she can tap her home equity or reverse mortgage to help as well.&rdquo;In the first scenario, Dan points out that the woman in declining health could find herself in a Medicaid situation which may lead her to a facility far from home and family. When Dan&rsquo;s strategy is used, the widow doesn&rsquo;t lose her home and uses her LTC coverage to hire someone to help her and stay in her own home.&ldquo;Along with the fact that her income from the SPIA, her home, cash and the Roth are either not taxed or taxed at a lower amount, the best part&rdquo;, Dan says, &ldquo;is that they are not recognized by Medicare so her health costs remain low and her Social Security benefits remain constant.&rdquo;In the next article, I&rsquo;ll dive into this topic of means tested Medicare and how it impacts the income of retirees, including reaching into their Social Security when I discuss this with another author of &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Dont-Know-About-Retirement/dp/0985082097/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389621533&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=what+you+don%27t+know+about+retirement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What You Don&rsquo;t Know About Retirement Will Hurt You!  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; Michael Gerali.</p>",

    "content": "<p> All executives (at least all that I know) want to show that they can come into a company, break everything down and make it faster, better, stronger and leaner. They want to convince you that they will lead your company into the next level of performance efficiency and innovation because&hellip;well, they are executives and they&rsquo;ve been fixing things for years, right? Uhm, so why are all Executive Resumes bloated and inefficient?</p><p> Executive Resumes all look the same really- the name prominently displayed (with a huge &ndash; really  huge font) followed by a &ldquo;Professional Summary&rdquo; the usually begins &ldquo;An exceptional Leader with 25 years of experience of highly effective, cross functional leadership abilities&hellip;&rdquo; yada, yada, yada. And that&rsquo;s usually followed by a &ldquo;Core Strengths&rdquo; section chocked full of every buzzword imaginable, for instance:</p><li> Employee Engagement                  </li><li> Strategic Planning</li><li> Workforce Management</li><li> Talent Management</li><li> Mergers</li><li> Organizational Change</li><li> Infrastructure</li><li> Strategic Partnerships <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Executive Execution (I&rsquo;ve actually seen it) </strong></p><p> Executives should be able to do all those things however anyone can Google &ldquo;Executive Resumes&rdquo; and then load their resumes, CV&rsquo;s, cover letter, websites, biographies and LinkedIn profiles with all kinds of words.  While talking with some of the Recruiters and Head Hunters in my network of thousands, they all say the same thing; &ldquo;Executive resumes just aren&rsquo;t attractive or eye-catching.&rdquo;By eye-catching they are not referencing gimmicks or pictures; they are talking about a visually stimulating design with clear and concise content.</p><p> <strong>  There is a new Executive Resume in town &ndash; and it&rsquo;s streamlined-  lean, sexy and totally relevant. </strong></p><p> Do you want to impress Headhunters, Recruiters and Hiring Authorities? Then you need to cut through the belabored adverbs and adjectives and just tell them how you have added value in the past and how you intend to add value to their company in the future.</p><p> It&rsquo;s alright to have a number of specialties and accomplishments however, instead hiring someone to stretch the margins of your resume and add a bunch of words; consider hiring someone who will apply the lean process to your credentials.  Time is money; Headhunters and Recruiters don&rsquo;t have time to filter through all of that rhetoric to figure out if you are the right one for the job &ndash; remember they have a bunch of traditional Executive resumes to scan through.</p><p> <strong>  Where is it written that an Executive Resume has to be verbose and loquacious? </strong></p><p> The ultra-talented and experienced individual does not need a per ponderous of color language as evidence of skill; they simply need to show accomplishments.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Structure is the difference in doling out drivel and telling a story. We&rsquo;ll outline some storytelling basics you can use in your next blog post to hook the reader early, keep them reading along, and finish with a bang. There&rsquo;s an old adage about public speaking that suggests you start by telling your audience what you&rsquo;re going to tell them. We think there&rsquo;s some merit in that thought.</p><p> <strong>  Shine a Light on Your Purpose </strong></p><p> Start with a purpose, point your way to where you&rsquo;re going and tell your reader what they&rsquo;re going to get out of the deal. Just don&rsquo;t give the end away. A real hook will create interest without answering all the questions and give the reader a reason to continue reading.</p><p> <strong>  Lights, Camera, Action </strong></p><p> Next, set the stage. Introduce your relevant facts, information, or set the scene. Ground your reader in the world you&rsquo;re going to be discussing. If you&rsquo;re making a case for the use of all-natural organic fertilizers, here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;d talk about the ways chemical pesticides can harm the earth. If you&rsquo;re telling the story of an amputee realizing her goals through the use of prosthetic limbs, here&rsquo;s where you talk about the difficulty she faces. Stories need a setting, so create yours here.</p><p> <strong>  Create Drama </strong></p><p> Setting the stage should include creating some obstacles. Whether your story is about the futility of fighting intractable forces or an inspiring tale of overcoming impossible odds, you&rsquo;ve got to have an obstacle to overcome. It might be a mountain and it might be a molehill, as long as it provides tension, you&rsquo;ve done your job.</p><p> <strong>  Create Suspense </strong></p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve set the stage and built your obstacle, provide the spark. Stories need action. Action creates interest, and here&rsquo;s where you provide yours. Set your hero on the path to overcome their obstacle or tell your audience about the solution to the problem you&rsquo;ve described.</p><p> <strong>  The Triumphant Return </strong></p><p> After you&rsquo;ve provided the spark that sets your story in motion, feed the fires and watch the fireworks. Combine your previously constructed obstacles with your newly-introduced action. Something&rsquo;s going to give, and the fun part is figuring out what. Telling a story about how your pool chemicals create the safest swimming environment? This part is where you&rsquo;ll describe how they work, the problems they solve, and all the exciting chemical reactions. In your inspirational tale, this is when the heroine actually reaches her goal. This is the climax, the final battle.</p><p> <strong>  Wrap It Up </strong></p><p> Finally, wrap it up nicely. Did you hang a big unanswered question in the air when you opened? You&rsquo;d better answer it here. Reflect on the action, remind the reader how the hero triumphed and apply the moral of whatever tale you&rsquo;ve told to whatever lesson you&rsquo;re teaching. Once you&rsquo;ve got that under control, you&rsquo;ll be on your way to telling compelling stories.</p>",

But I soon learned that despite my best intentions, I was considered &ldquo;the boss.&rdquo; Yeah, you&rsquo;ve got it&ndash;  <a href=\"http://imperfectboss.letsgrowleaders.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo; kind  </u>  .  </a> When I called, they answered&ndash;dropping everything to get me what I needed.</p><p> Of course every now and then that&rsquo;s EXACTLY what you need. The sky is falling, the customer&rsquo;s really ticked off, or your bosses&rsquo; hair is on fire. Got it.</p><p> Just remember, creative work and breakthroughs require concentration. No one does their best thinking in a constant barrage of interruption.</p><p> If it can wait, give back some mental energy by making ongoing lists for each person and setting a time to run through what you need. They&rsquo;ll be in a better space to think and respond, and in the meantime they got on with their other priorites. Resist the urge to just pick up the phone and disrupt their flow.</p><p> <strong>  2. Give Permission to Do </strong></p><p> I recently met with the founder and CEO of a medium size company who had brought me in to do some leadership development work with the frontline team.  I shared the laundry list of amazing business improvement ideas that had surfaced as we talked leadership&ndash; literally side effects of deeper conversation. These were solid ways to improve revenue and customer service. His response, &ldquo;Karin, what CEO in their right mind would be upset with them just doing these things? If they&rsquo;re good ideas, why didn&rsquo;t they just do them?&rdquo;</p><p> His entrepreneurial spirit couldn&rsquo;t imagine a mindset of waiting for permission, but he&rsquo;d not said that out loud. Be sure if your team is busting with ideas they feel encouraged to share and try them.</p><p> <strong>  3. Expose Them to More </strong></p><p> In almost every company I&rsquo;m working with one of the big asks is to help the team think more strategically. As I dig in the number one issue is almost always lack of exposure to the bigger context of the vision, the financial strategy, or how their work connects with other departments. It&rsquo;s impossible to connect the dots if you only see half of them. The more your team knows, the deeper their thinking will become. If you want to grow big picture thinkers, give them something to think about beyond their current role.</p><p> <strong>  The Rest of the Story </strong></p><p> This is part four in a seven part series of how to outsmart the competition. If you&rsquo;re just tuning in, here&rsquo;s the rest of the story.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/learning-development/getting-there-early/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Alex Pirouz </u></p><p> Over the last 10 years, we have undoubtedly witnessed a fundamental shift in the way traditional businesses operate and engage with their customers.</p><p> The explosion of the internet and mobile technology, and the seemingly endless potential of the ways that they can be used, is outstripping and sometimes undermining structures of working that have prevailed for more than a century.</p><p> And it keeps changing every day. These changes have also had a big influence on how the business world operates. Its influence is felt in practically all aspects of the day-to-day operations of businesses, large and small.</p><p> This revolution is removing commercial and technological barriers that have previously hampered free communication between people. Major advancements in mobile technology and the advent of mobile web mean we can now shop, advertise, read, purchase and bank with our mobile device.</p><p> By challenging traditional business models, the convergence of readily available internet services and mass mobile devices has delivered unimaginable benefits to both consumer and brand.</p><p> Mobility delivers choice for the customer and also lowers barriers to entry for third parties. Integrating old business models with new to provide choice to all demographics, whether in internet or non-internet ready markets, will continue to unlock the full potential of mobile technology to all industries.</p><p> There is no doubt that business technology has revolutionised the way companies conduct business, but the question remains: are small business owners ready for the shift in technology and if so, what resources have they got in place to handle these rapid changes?</p><p> In a survey conducted by Small Business Technology Institute (SBTI) and Small Business Technology Magazine, managers from more than 3000 companies reported that after health care, managing the evolving technologies available is proving to be a major concern.</p><p> The report also indicated that small businesses tend to allocate very limited human and financial resources to support their IT functions; and small businesses approach IT support on a reactive basis and rely heavily on tactical support by product lenders.</p><p> This type of approach and decision making around an area that is arguably the most important sector within any business operating under a rapidly evolving marketplace is a sure fire way to get taken over by competitors or go out of business.</p><p> For the very first time small businesses have the opportunity to implement business technology and level the playing field with larger organisations &ndash; a chance that should not be taken lightly for those looking to remain in business.</p><p> While the list of advantages are too long to document, below you will find several key advantages to how your business will improve as a result of technological advances.</p><p> <strong>  REDUCING BUSINESS COSTS </strong></p><p> Small business owners can use technology to reduce business costs. Business technology helps automate back office functions, such as record keeping, accounting and payroll. Business owners can also use technology to create secure environments for maintaining sensitive business or consumer information.</p><p> <strong>  IMPROVE COMMUNICATION </strong></p><p> Business technology can help small businesses improve their communication processes. Emails, texting, websites and personal digital products applications (apps), can help companies improve communication with consumers. Using several types of information technology communication methods allow companies to saturate the economic market with their message.</p><p> Companies may also receive more consumer feedback through these electronic communication methods. These methods also allow companies to reach consumers through mobile devices in a real-time format.</p><p> <strong>  POTENTIAL INCREASE IN BUSINESS </strong></p><p> Technology allows small businesses to reach new economic markets. Rather than just selling consumer goods or services in the local market, small businesses can reach regional, national and international markets. Retail websites are the most common way small businesses sell products in several different economic markets.</p><p> Websites represent a low-cost option that consumers can access 24/7 when needing to purchase goods or services. Small business owners can also use internet advertising to reach new markets and customers through carefully placed web banners or ads.</p><p> <strong>  CONSIDERATIONS </strong></p><p> Business technology allows companies to outsource business function to other businesses in the national and international business environment. Outsourcing can help companies lower costs and focus on  completing the business function they do best. Technical supportand customer service are two common functions companies outsource.</p><p> Small business owners may consider outsourcing functions if they do not have the proper facilities or available manpower. Technology allows businessesto outsource functions to the cheapest areas possible, including foreign countries.</p><p> The society as we know it is going through a radical makeover, thanks to constant connectivity everywhere.This is creating a need for a digital makeover of everything &ndash; from retail to our postal system. It is changing our infrastructure needs and it is also increasing the velocityof business.  To stay ahead of the game business owners must also change the traditional way of operating their day-to-day business.</p>",

    "title": "Seven Employee Engagement Lessons from the Gridiron",
    "link": "seven-employee-engagement-lessons-from-the-gridiron",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s that time of the year when the world is obsessed with American football. </strong> Even those of us whose team is not involved in the playoffs (sigh, better luck next year my beloved San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants) get caught up in the drama and action. As I was watching the playoff games, I started to think about how football relates to the field of employee engagement.</p><p> There are so many lessons that we can all learn from the game of football. You don&rsquo;t need to know how to play the game to find value in what happens on the field.</p><p> <strong>  1. Engaging your employees (and yourself) is not a contact sport, it is a connect sport. </strong>  It&rsquo;s not about hitting someone as hard as you possibly can as you chase him down the field. It&rsquo;s about looking them in the eye and making a one-on-one connection. Even opposing players stare intently at each other before the play to assess what they believe is going to happen. Think about a cornerback watching the quarterback&rsquo;s eyes as he snaps the ball or the defensive lineman carefully eyeing the offensive guard across the line.</p><p> <strong>  2. Alignment is what matters. </strong>  The coach is responsible for leading and setting the goals for his team. He needs to make sure that all his players are aligned with those goals. There must be complete transparency in the workplace (in this case the locker room and playing field) as to where you are going and how you will get there.</p><p> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t just tell me what to do, tell me why it matters.  </strong> Setting context is a key role of the coach and a leader. Simply barking orders at people won&rsquo;t engage them, but if you tell them why you believe this is the right thing to do, your team will rise to the task with commitment and passion.</p><p> <strong>  4. One size does not fit all. </strong>  There are 53 people on the active roster of a football team at any time. Each one of them has a different trigger for their own engagement and it is imperative that the coach knows what drives his players. What is important to one player might not mean that much to someone else. Those engagement triggers are crucial to achieving engagement.</p><p> <strong>  5. You don&rsquo;t usually reach your goals alone. </strong>  Football is a team sport that requires full commitment, passion and engagement from everyone on the team. A running back needs a blocker to open a hole for him and a quarterback needs his offensive line to hold off the defense so he has time to make the play. If even one member of the team is disengaged and not giving their full effort, it can have a devastating effect on the field through miscues like a fumble or missed tackle.</p><p> <strong>  6. It&rsquo;s important to never give up on your goals and stay engaged until the very last moment.  </strong> The Seattle-Green Bay playoff game was a prime example of this. Even though the Seahawks were playing terribly for three quarters of the game, they never lost sight of the prize at the end. The coach continued to keep them aligned on their ultimate goal and team members remained steadfast in their support of each other. Being so incredibly connected to each other and the mission and purpose of the organization allowed each player to never lose hope as they all put forth their best efforts.</p><p> <strong>  7. A thank you really matters. </strong>  Engagement is what motivates people to not only feel dedicated to their job and their life, but also to feel rewarded by what they do and how they do it. It pushes people to look at things differently and go above and beyond, not because they have to but because they want to. The two coaches taking their teams to the Super Bowl are complete opposites. Pete Carroll is boisterous and demonstrative and runs on to the field to hug someone who made a great play. Bill Belichick is quiet and thoughtful, and relies on a quick pat on the back to recognize someone. One style is no more effective than the other; it&rsquo;s all about appreciating and recognizing great work.</p><p> Employees want to be part of something bigger than themselves and part of the underlying success of the team. They want to be energized by their job and look forward to going to work, willing to put in the extra effort it takes to make their organization a success, or in this case the winner of the Super Bowl. Here&rsquo;s to an engaging and passionate game on February 1st for all involved, including those of us that are watching from our couches. No matter what &lsquo;game&rsquo; we play, the message is the same. <strong>  It&rsquo;s all about starting out connected, committed and dedicated to a shared goal. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cathycurtis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Cathy Curtis  </u> </a></p><p> There was a time when men&rsquo;s grooming and fashion was as complicated as women &ndash; but that time is long gone. Today, women probably spend 4 x as much as men on their appearance and unwittingly get caught in the trap of trying to keep up with the fashion and beauty industry. Clothes shopping can get out of control, destroying other financial goals. Fortunately, with some effort, it&rsquo;s possible to start spending more prudently.</p><p> The first step is to face reality. Go over last year&rsquo;s credit card and bank statements and figure out how much money went to clothing and accessories. Then, cut back 30% from your past spending at first. (To try to cut spending abruptly and drastically is a recipe for failure, so best to do it in stages).</p><p> <strong>  So now, with your new reduced budget &ndash; here are some tips to stick to it. </strong> Notice that many of these tips are as much about the psychology of shopping as they are about the acquiring of new clothing.</p><p> 1. Try very hard to schedule shopping trips and not spontaneously drop into your favorite stores just to &ldquo;take a look at what is new.&rdquo;</p><p> 2. Don&rsquo;t shop when you are lonely, tired, frustrated, anxious or bored.</p><p> 3. Avoid shopping immediately after a setback or a major victory.</p><p> 4. When you catch yourself in a shopping frenzy, leave the store before buying anything and get centered.</p><p> 5. Don&rsquo;t let friends, shop-owners or salespeople convince you that something looks great on you when you know perfectly well that it doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> 6. Decide what you need in your wardrobe and make a list. Take the list with you when you go shopping.</p><p> 7. Before you buy anything on sale ask yourself whether you would buy it at full price.</p><p> 8. Think quality, not quantity. Not only will the item of clothing last longer, but you are likely to love it longer too.</p><p> 9. Stop the rationalizing- you don&rsquo;t need a whole new wardrobe because you got a new job.</p><p> 10. Buy things you&rsquo;re going to wear now, not for a far-off occasion or event that may never happen.</p><p> 11. Buy clothing for the way you live now, not for the way you wish you were living. (Buying a cocktail dress when you never go to cocktail parties.)</p><p> 12. Avoid buying one-off pieces of clothing that don&rsquo;t go with anything in your wardrobe.</p><p> 13. Don&rsquo;t buy clothing in the wrong size thinking either that you will lose weight or that you will have it &ldquo;taken in&rdquo;.</p><p> 14. Try shopping with cash not credit cards &ndash; easier to set limits.</p><p> 15. Limit the amount of trendy items you buy to just a small percentage of your wardrobe.</p><p> 18. Think #10 &ndash; everything you buy should be as close to a &ldquo;10&rdquo; as possible.</p><p> 19. Realize that a new dress, skirt, blouse or jacket are not going to make you more beautiful or change your life.</p><p> 20. To help make better buying decisions, analyze your wardrobe to understand what your favorite go-to pieces are. What are the common themes?</p><p> 21. Hone-in what colors and styles look best on you to limit choices.</p><p> 22. Instead of going shopping with girlfriends, do something else, go for a hike, to a museum, out to lunch.</p><p> 23. One-in, one-out rule. (If your wardrobe is very large, you may want to release 2 or 3 pieces for each that you buy).</p><p> 24. Think like an economist and analyze cost per wear before buying.</p><p> 25. Now, track your clothing and accessory spending for a few months. Set a new lower budget for the next month. Tracking will also show whether you buy the same items over and over, which is very common. How many pairs of jeans or black tank tops does one need?</p><p> <strong>  It may take several attempts to kick the shopping habit. </strong> But with each small victory you will get stronger. Just think about all the time and money you will gain by not buying so many clothes. It will be worth it.</p><p> p.s. This post is written by someone who loves fashion and who continues to incorporate these tips into her own shopping habits</p>",

    "title": "9 Ways to Motivate Advisor Firm Employees with Performance Reviews",
    "link": "9-ways-to-motivate-advisor-firm-employees-with-performance-reviews",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Let&rsquo;s face it, this time of year managers and employees alike are starting to think about performance reviews. Stress and anxiety levels rise and less than favorable opinions about performance reviews are muttered between peers. To top it off, a recent <u>  <a href=\"https://www.leadershipiq.com/how-can-leaders-and-managers-make-performance-reviews-more-meaningful/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leadership IQ study  </a> </u> of 48,000 leaders said that only 13% of those leaders find reviews useful.</p><p> Effective performance reviews are an opportunity for honest and open communication. Although past performance is discussed, you can inspire and engage employees by placing focus on plans for the future. As leaders, we need to change the perception of performance reviews from ineffective, uncomfortable, and criticism focused to collaborative and positive, even when communicating negative results. </p><p> There are 9 actions managers can take to conduct performance reviews to encourage and motivate employees.  </p><li> <strong>  Hold Reviews On Neutral Ground: Get out of the office! </strong> One of the worst places to hold a review is on your turf. Employees will feel more relaxed and are more likely to contribute to a conversation in an environment that is neutral.</li><li> <strong>  Know Your Team: </strong> Attitude and performance are two key components of every team member&rsquo;s position. The two are often linked together and at times there are outside forces causing employee unhappiness, poor attitude, and unsatisfactory performance.  Be friendly enough to know what&rsquo;s going on in their life. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to be friends with employees but you should know them well enough to talk casually about their life outside of work. This will help develop trust and allow you to see the whole picture.  </li><li> <strong>  Have Systems And Processes In Place: </strong> Employees want to belong to a company that understands how to manage people and has consistent performance review processes in place. Share your process with employees early on to avoid surprise and to create mutual respect between both parties.</li><li> <strong>  Hold Informal Meetings: </strong> Make performance management part of your culture. Schedule informal reviews throughout the year to improve communication, build rapport, and provide a benchmark to ensure goals are consistently met. Keep in mind; employees will support what they help create. This is a great time to reassess tasks and collaborate with team members.</li><li> <strong>  Prepare In Advance: </strong> Plan for reviews. Leaders typically get anxious 6-8 weeks before the review but wait until crunch time to prepare. Effective leadership manages performance year round. Document performance along with specific metrics and store them in an electronic folder to maintain uniformity and organization.</li><li> <strong>  Avoid Using Stock Phrases: </strong> Reviews need to be specific and meaningful. Avoid generic phrases such as; &ldquo;Jane, you really did a great job this year.&rdquo; Instead, provide clear-cut examples; &ldquo;Jane, your input on our project in the 2nd quarter really made a difference to the bottom line and engaged our clients.&rdquo; The more specific your language,  the more impact it will have.</li><li> <strong>  Provide Alignment: </strong> Employees are motivated when they see how their day-to-day work applies to the big picture. Educate employees so they understand how their job duties contribute to the overall goals of your firm. </li><li> <strong>  Talk About The Future: </strong> Recreate your performance appraisals to include future plans and goals for your firm and employees. While past performance is reviewed, employees will be motivated when you incorporate a vision that helps move them forward. Discuss career ambitions, new responsibilities, and professional development. Employees are likely to be receptive and motived when you talk about where you see them in the next 12 months versus placing the entire focus on the past.</li><li> <strong>  Ask Good Questions: </strong> A good leader must listen, ask questions, and position employees so they feel comfortable during reviews. Start with discussion and questions; &ldquo;Tell me about your highlights during this performance period.&rdquo; &ldquo;What areas would you like more help?&rdquo; &ldquo;How have you used your skills and competencies?&rdquo; Team members will realize that the review isn&rsquo;t just a one-way drill. <br/>  </li><p> In conclusion, employees spend more time each day with their managers and co-workers than with family. A quality relationship is critical to the level of engagement and success of a team. Train managers to plan for and deliver performance reviews that empower and strengthen employees. Employees won&rsquo;t leave a company, but they will leave a manager.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Leaders become great, not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others.&rdquo; &ndash; John Maxwell </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  When prospects meet with you for the first time, usually they already feel positive, negative or neutral about doing business with you. </strong> The mindset they come to you with can be a critically important factor in determining whether they will eventually do business with you or not. Why is this the case?</p><p> Our predispositions often play out the way we think they will. It&rsquo;s not a mystery but really just human nature and psychology. If people come to the table wanting to work with you, they will find reasons to support their initial thoughts &ndash; even if you don&rsquo;t have a perfect presentation. If they come to the table NOT really wanting to work with you, only willing to hear what you have to say &ndash; they will be consciously or subconsciously looking for reasons to be right and not choose you. It is true in politics, in business, in dating and in life. We want to be &ldquo;right,&rdquo; and often that need overshadows many other factors.</p><p> <strong>  If I come to the table positive about you, I will likely find a reason to be right. Have you given people a reason to be positive about you before they meet you? That&rsquo;s what marketing is supposed to do. </strong></p><p> Instead of having to put on the hard sell at the end of your seminar, what if attendees came to their own conclusion that they want to work with you? What if your website made people feel they have arrived at the right place, and your firm could truly serve them? What if your clients were powerful advocates promoting your positives and generating referrals? It&rsquo;s possible, of course. But you have to start with the end in mind. Ask yourself &ndash; does my marketing do this?</p><p> I believe the goal of your marketing is to share who you are and what you do, focused on creating a positive aura around your business. The only way to do this is by sharing more about you in an authentic way and avoiding the overly stiff, professional marketing speak. The more you connect through your marketing, the more you will give your prospects a reason to later say, &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; . . . in a positive way of course!!</p>",

    "title": "What 4 Real Success Stories Can Teach Us about Social Selling in Financial Services",
    "link": "what-4-real-success-stories-can-teach-us-about-social-selling-in-financial-services",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  If you are not an active participant in social networks, it can be difficult to imagine how social engagement and online networking leads to actual business opportunities. </strong></p><p> Yet, there are financial professionals out there that have embraced social selling and are having real success driving business development with it.</p><p> I asked some of these advisors to describe a situation in which they acquired a new customer through social networking.</p><p> Here are four stories that illustrate some powerful lessons every advisor can apply to their own social selling strategies:</p><p> <strong>  1. Connect with people around common interests. </strong></p><p> I started following a person on Twitter because of our common interest in dogs and dog rescue. We developed a friendship on and offline. When this person left their employer and had a pension to commute, she contacted me through DM (Direct Message) on Twitter to ask me if I could help them with the options they were given. This person and their spouse are now my clients.</p><p> Lessons for professionals:</p><li> Pursue connections with people online based on genuine, shared interests.</li><li> Get to know your online connections offline and your offline connections online.</li><li> Give people real reasons to know, like and trust you before doing any business. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Build an audience by contributing value. </strong></p><p> I was approached through email by a woman that runs a small publishing company. She was looking for a personal finance columnist for her quarterly local publication that targets families. She told me that she&rsquo;d crowd-sourced on Twitter asking for recommendations and three people gave her my name. So far, my articles in this publication have generated several leads and two new clients/sales.</p><p> Lessons for professionals:</p><li> Treat your online followers as an audience you are serving, never as leads.</li><li> Recognize that the real benefit of social engagement is that others will tell your story &ndash; and refer opportunities to you. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3. Create &ldquo;social proof&rdquo;. </strong></p><p> I met a prospect at a business networking breakfast. We tweeted back and forth for a period of time and eventually she transferred all her business to me. When she checked out my social profiles, she said she liked my digital personality which is a reflection of who I really am. This person now comes with me to community events as a client/guest and always Tweets and Instagrams to her followers that she&rsquo;s with me doing stuff with me in the community.</p><p> Lessons for professionals:</p><li> Your online presence &ndash; your website and social profiles &ndash; functions as &ldquo;social proof&rdquo; helping people validate who you are and what you do.</li><li> In social media, conversations are markets. In other words, the conversation that starts with a face-to-face meeting at a networking meeting continues via social media. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4. Helping is the new selling. </strong></p><p> Within my firm, I&rsquo;m known as &ldquo;the social media guy&rdquo;, so I often get asked questions about my strategies and requests to teach colleagues.

It is senseless to squander time with ill-matched possibilities.  </p><p> Once you have reasonably qualified those you wish to approach, the next step is to reach out with a reason as to why their time might be well spent in speaking with you.

The long process includes speaking, listening and negotiating a preferred outcome for all parties.  Adhering to desires of the other party as much as possible, being punctual, and accepting fault as appropriate, all go toward building trust. </p><p> For those long-term sales, mini tests may be thrown your way to see how you handle difficult situations.  Passing the test, the trust is achieved and business begins to flow your way.</p><p> In the hiring realm, on occasion mini tests are thrown at job applicants.  In this case, honesty is monitored in terms of truthful answers, facial expressions and reactions.

This businessperson resolves problems as quickly as possible, apologizes for the inconvenience, and delivers beyond expectations.  In return, that person becomes &ldquo;the go-to provider&rdquo;.  No competitor is able to get a foot in the door.  That is the definition of true client loyalty.</p><p> Why would a client seek out a &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; vendor?  Should they recognize the vendor is dependable and delivers as promised, the need to interview many suppliers for future needs diminishes.

    "title": "Using Digital Channels to Listen to Your Customers",
    "link": "using-digital-channels-to-listen-to-your-customers",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Listening is key to the entire sales process. Here&rsquo;s how social media and search engines can help you listen and connect with the people who have the most impact on your business. </strong></p><p> There&rsquo;s a single distinction between great and not-so-great salespeople that just about everyone can agree on: It&rsquo;s the ability to listen. The same thing can be said of managers, customer service personnel and small-business owners. Those who are most successful aren&rsquo;t just doers; they&rsquo;re great listeners.</p><p> When we converse with people face to face, we not only listen to what they&rsquo;re saying, we also learn to catch subtle social cues. Those who are observant enough can see when a person&rsquo;s body language suggests they&rsquo;re losing interest or that the expression on their face indicates confusion. And while it&rsquo;s harder to listen in the digital environment, with more and more business being conducted on social channels, it&rsquo;s absolutely crucial that we learn how to do it.</p><p> <strong>  Looking People in the Eye Digitally </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s a simple concept: People want the same things on social media channels that they want when they walk into a store. If they ask a question that applies to their unique circumstances, they don&rsquo;t want a boilerplate response. If they post a complaint, they want someone to respond to it. While we recognize and act on this all the time in face-to-face settings, the standard for digital interaction has been lowered dramatically in comparison. Why?</p><p> A big part of that disconnect is the lazy marketing that&rsquo;s been going on for a while. Over the past few decades, we&rsquo;ve become used to broadcast messaging, display advertising and a &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; mentality. We&rsquo;ve been trying to apply those concepts to digital media when, in fact, we should be going back to the basics of person-to-person interaction to focus more on customer relationships.</p><p> Another reason is that social cues are easier to miss without the benefit of body language and personal interaction, so it seems easier to manage your digital presence at arm&rsquo;s length than to truly dig in and get involved. However, easier isn&rsquo;t always better. Social isn&rsquo;t magic: It takes time and effort, much as it does with personal interactions.</p><p> The key is to learn digital listening skills and use them to relate better with individuals. I call it &ldquo;looking people in the eye digitally,&rdquo; and it comes down to re-learning some of those face-to-face skills and applying them to digital channels.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t Let It Overwhelm You </strong></p><p> Learning to listen digitally can be intimidating, especially if you&rsquo;re inexperienced in social technology. There&rsquo;s a lot of noise, and it&rsquo;s coming from many different directions. But don&rsquo;t let that discourage you. While listening to the broader community is an important part of looking people in the eye digitally, your primary concern is listening to one person at a time.</p><p> There are two simple social skills that apply in equal measure to social channels: respect and honesty. No matter where you meet people or where your conversation takes place, if you treat people with respect and honesty, you can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t worry so much about the technical trappings. While it&rsquo;s important to learn about the different features that social platforms offer, you don&rsquo;t need specialized knowledge to get started. Just be human&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be safe as long as you keep your eye on connecting and conversing in a respectful, authentic way.</p><p> <strong>  Take Advantage of the Social Time Lag </strong></p><p> One of the advantages of social over face-to-face interaction is that it can take some of the inherent nervousness out of the listening process. Digital conversations allow for the type of measured, detailed responses that are rarely possible in a face-to-face setting.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve all been there at one time or another. You have an important conversation with someone and leave feeling as if you didn&rsquo;t make your point clearly enough. Later, when you&rsquo;re driving back to your office, you think of the joke, anecdote or example that would have framed your point perfectly.</p><p> With social, you can listen without having to worry about committing rapid-fire facts to memory. The information you need to listen effectively is already compiled&mdash;the person&rsquo;s name, profile and a documented account of their question or comment is just a click away. Take advantage of those things! Consider reading the information that your connections share in their profile. Look at the pictures they post and the links they share. You can take the time to learn about your connection, and demonstrate that knowledge when you talk to them.</p><p> As a young salesman, I was taught to find out as much as possible about my contact prior to meeting with them. A great way to do that was to look around their office (if you were lucky enough to have a minute or two before they arrived). You could see diplomas on the wall, pictures, trophies&mdash;anything to get a sense of who this person was. Did they like to golf? Fish? Did they have kids? Where did they go to college? It was a great way to find commonalities and bring personal context into the conversation: &ldquo;Oh, I see you went to school near Park City, Utah. I love to ski! When was the last time you were there?&rdquo;</p><p> The great thing about social is that you can do this even while you&rsquo;re chatting with the customer in real time. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with them, you can visit their profile and brush up on important details. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with something related to the topic at hand, you can conduct a quick search and find the relevant facts while you&rsquo;re chatting. Compare that to a face-to-face meeting where you have to remember the name of the person to whom you&rsquo;ve just been introduced, listen to what they&rsquo;re saying, make mental notes of important details and think about how you&rsquo;ll respond, all at the same time.</p><p> On the flip side of the coin, you should make sure your social profiles share enough about you that others will also be able to connect quickly and easily. For instance, use your real name (and a smiling photo) in your personal profile. Provide a description that offers people ways to relate to you personally, and include a link to your website. Don&rsquo;t force people to dig around to find out who you really are.The important thing is to be real&mdash;not perfect.</p><p> <strong>  Lurking Can Be a Good Thing </strong></p><p> The great thing about the digital environment is that you don&rsquo;t need to be involved in a conversation to start listening. In fact, listening passively (or lurking, in digital lingo) can be a great way to get your feet wet and learn about a given medium simply by watching how others use it.</p><p> Lurking in digital channels isn&rsquo;t usually considered creepy or nefarious. In fact, most sites have tools to help you find the type of conversations you&rsquo;d like to listen to. For instance, Facebook has added a trending function, while blog-oriented channels like Tumblr and WordPress allow you to browse by tags and key terms. LinkedIn indicates groups you might be interested in joining based on what you put in your profile. Twitter&rsquo;s search function is perhaps the most efficient because it allows you to search hashtags to find conversations around a common phrase.</p><p> Searching hashtags can be a great way to start listening. Just Google &ldquo;#[topic of interest],&rdquo; and browse the results. Typically you&rsquo;ll find more than a few sites and blog posts with lists of hashtags relevant to your topic of choice. This method is especially useful when you&rsquo;re searching for hashtags on conversations with long shelf lives, like those that involve professional networking and skilled services.</p><p> You can use hashtag terms to search on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook or search engines, and you can also use them to connect. For instance, on Twitter, you can find TweetChats within your industry or on any topic of interest. Want to find conversations around customer service? Check out #CustSvc on Twitter, and see what conversations come up.</p><p> The connection advantages to searching with hashtags is a big plus. If you&rsquo;re listening to a specific conversation and like what someone has to say, follow them and send a personal &ldquo;hello&rdquo; message. If you like their tweets, read some of what they share in other places. If you like something they share, check out the profile of the person who made the original post. This is all part of the digital listening process. Repeat a few times, and you&rsquo;ll quickly start building connections with similar interests.</p><p> <strong>  Should Listening Be Automated? </strong></p><p> If listening seems like a lot of work, you might be thinking &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t there an app for that?&rdquo; Yes, there are automated listening tools out there. Some good ones include  <u>  <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite  </a> </u> , which you can use for viewing multiple hashtag searches. Use  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Alerts  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.mention.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mention  </a> </u>  to get media alerts about where you or your company has been mentioned.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important not to depend too much on tools, however. We&rsquo;re talking about connecting with individuals, after all, so it helps to go directly to someone&rsquo;s individual profile on Twitter and Facebook to get a sense of what they&rsquo;re having conversations about.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard the expression &ldquo;I wish I was a fly on the wall.&rdquo; Well, today, consumers are offering to let us be a fly on their wall, and we&rsquo;re not taking them up on their offer. You should go to the pages of your fans or followers and see what they&rsquo;re saying&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I call &ldquo;getting your hands dirty.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not about collecting data points, but getting a feel for how people perceive you. It&rsquo;s marketing intelligence that&rsquo;s right at your fingertips.</p><p> Businesses can scale this kind of listening by empowering their employees to do it. Many times, when I&rsquo;m in front of an audience, I&rsquo;ll ask, &ldquo;How many people here go to the profiles of their friends, fans and followers every day and see what they&rsquo;re talking about? Or have employees who do it for you?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m always surprised at how few hands go up.</p><p> Whatever automated listening tools you have, nothing replaces personal, &ldquo;look-them-in-the-eye&rdquo; individual listening. If all your employees were able to make room for that on a daily basis with your customer profiles, think of what that collective intelligence could do for your company.</p><p> The bottom line is, many of us have let personal interaction with our prospects and customers take a back seat to technology, when it should be the other way around&mdash;actively listening is a human skill that can&rsquo;t be replicated by a machine or an app. Digital channels give us more ways to connect with more people and drive more conversations than ever before.</p><p> In the end, people want to be treated like people. We just have to remember how important true listening is in the process and use those old-fashioned skills to give value and build the kind of relationships than turn those people into customers.</p>",

But it&rsquo;s also firms like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.learnvest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LearnVest.com  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Amazon.com  </a> </u>  that I keep wondering, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;  I know, I know.  We were so comfortable before and now these organizations are all up in our nut and crackin&rsquo; it.  What&rsquo;s that about?  What do we do?</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s that about? </strong>    <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lifehealth.com/half-financial-executives-surveyed-predict-outside-disruption-life-insurance-market/?utm_source=iContact&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=e-newsLink&amp;utm_content=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LIMRA   </a>  <a href=\"http://www.lifehealth.com/half-financial-executives-surveyed-predict-outside-disruption-life-insurance-market/?utm_source=iContact&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=e-newsLink&amp;utm_content=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recently shared on Life &amp; Health Advisor  </a> </u>  that 57% of financial executives believe an outside source will be a disruptive force in the next few years.  Holy smacks!  Add to that mix 21% of middle market consumers who are willing to buy insurance online and you have a business in the making, people.  That&rsquo;s how disruption works!  When a fifth of the people raise their hand and say, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll never meet face-to-face with a person and buy insurance online with my credit card&rdquo; that&rsquo;s something that needs to sink in deep.  That&rsquo;s scary because the likelihood is the survey is probably conservative; it&rsquo;s probably closer to a fourth of the people.</p><p> <strong>  What do we do? </strong>   What we don&rsquo;t do is keep doing what we&rsquo;ve always done.  We have to innovate.  We can no longer work 8am to 5pm, make clients come to our office during our office hours and only talk about assets under management.  I have mad respect for wealth managers, but we must think past the AUM market and diversify our practices&hellip;become more holistic.  This same report talks about the underserved markets and low-interest rate environments being large concerns &ndash; why?  Because they REALLY are!</p><p> <strong>  In every challenge lies an opportunity. </strong>  That message is no different for our smaller practices as it is for mammoth companies like Google.  Can you reach out to some different people than you normally do?  Can you try using social media as a way to differentiate?  Are you learning new ways of doing business and marketing your business?  We must innovate.</p><p> <strong>  I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I read reports like this I always get a little pissy. </strong>  The thought of people who have no business being in our business makes me mad &ndash; and drives me to change the status quo.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  When we review existing life insurance policies for the clients of our RIAs, we find that certain plans are failing and at risk of lapsing prematurely. There are generally 3 main causes for this: </strong> <br/> <br/> Reason 1: Loans and withdrawals taken against the policy. <br/> <br/> Reason 2: The premiums were not paid as they were supposed to be. <br/> <br/> Reason 3: Assumptions that were made when the policy was sold were too optimistic. <br/> <br/> <strong>  In this article, we will explore loans and withdrawals. </strong> <br/> <br/> Loans and withdrawals are attractive selling features for life insurance because the premiums paid into a policy grow tax-deferred over time and the policyholder does not pay taxes while the policy accumulates wealth, similar to a 401(k). That money is accessible through either loans or withdrawals without paying tax on the amount taken out. Because of this feature, many view these policies as cash accumulation vehicles, putting money into them with the intent of funding college educations, or even supplementing retirement plans. Unfortunately, many insurance agents fail to explain that there can also be negative consequences associated with using policies for this purpose.</p><li> Making a withdrawal from a policy permanently means there is no intention of ever putting it back in. However much the policyholder takes out of the policy is tax-free up to the amount of premiums already paid - it&rsquo;s essentially just getting a return of the premium. Eg: If $100,000 were paid into the policy, the policyholder can withdraw up to $100,000 without being taxed. <br/>  </li><p> Problem: Taking money out of a policy may permanently reduce its cash value, and the death benefit. And if funds are withdrawn too early in the policy, it may trigger a taxable event.</p><li> A loan is when a policyholder borrows against the cash value of the policy. <br/>  </li><p> Problem: Loans accrue interest over time, so the outstanding loan amount gets significantly larger if it is not promptly paid back. Also, if a policyholder takes out a large loan and the policy lapses, or if the policy is surrendered or the policyholder dies, the outstanding loan becomes taxable as ordinary income, which can impart a tax burden.</p><p> If a client is considering taking money out of a life insurance policy, you will first need to find out whether a withdrawal or a loan is the most prudent course of action.</p><li> In the case of a withdrawal, an amount up to the basis (the total premiums paid) is usually the smartest route because it will not trigger any tax debt. The policyholder may forfeit some percentage of the death benefit, and some cash value, but it may still be the more cost-effective choice.</li><li> In the case of a loan, the cash value or death benefit of the policy will not be reduced permanently; the policyholder can simply return the money to his or her plan and the policy amounts revert to what they were before. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  A policyholder who has decided to take a loan should consider increasing his or her premiums:  </strong> The increase in premiums can be used to structure a loan pay off. Doing so will better sustain the death benefit and cash value. For example, if a given policyholder has taken a $10,000 loan and wishes to pay it off over 2 years, an increase in premiums of $500 a month can help prevent the loan from eroding the value of the policy.</p><p> Before your client decides whether to take a withdrawal or a loan on a policy, you will want to request an &ldquo;in force illustration.&rdquo; That will show hypothetically what the impact will be to the policy long term, and that will offer an insight into whether or not it will create serious problems down the road. You should also be sure to consult a qualified insurance expert to discuss the impact of taking money out of a policy before doing so.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The ranch I grew up on in the middle of Wyoming was isolated so it was impossible for my brother and I to attend public schools. Instead, we had a private tutor. The only person I had to compete against in my class was myself, so it was a continual game of personal best.I worked hard to beat my own record, and my teacher would respond by saying, &ldquo;Look at you&mdash;you&rsquo;ve worked hard to get a better score.&rdquo;As I&rsquo;ve gotten older, I realize that my teacher&rsquo;s response was incredibly unusual. Instead, most teachers, parents, and others in the educational system respond with, &ldquo;Look at you&mdash;you are so smart.&rdquo;</p><strong> Without realizing it, my teacher had  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck\" target=\"_blank\">   a growth mindset  </a> </u>  which believes that people get better by challenging themselves.</strong>The opposite represents a fixed mindset and is represented by how our educational system distributes grades and how most corporations conduct performance appraisals: talent is something that happens to you, not something you make happen.<strong> Whether you have a fixed mindset or a growth mindset influences how you approach peak performance.</strong>Peak performance is successfully using <u> mental toughness to develop the power of the mind</u> and to practice mental skills training in every aspect of life.Successful people believe that they can challenge themselves to continually grow and improve performance.Let&rsquo;s take a look at how they do this:<strong> 1.  <a href=\"/category/grow/human-performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  WHAT GRABS YOUR ATTENTION RULES YOUR LIFE </a></strong>We intentionally focus our attention on what is important in our life and those areas we want to grow.Our consciousness can handle only so much information, so we have selective attention. One key part of the brain which focuses our attention is the <u> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_activating_system\" target=\"_blank\">  Reticular Activating System (RAS </a> )</u>. It filters out important information that needs more attention from the unimportant that can be ignored. Without the RAS filter, we would be over-stimulated and distracted by noises from our environment around us.Focusing on the goal + focusing our attention on the activity to achieve the goal at the same time overstimulates the brain.<strong> Attaining a goal is something that happens in the future, and it pulls our attention away from where it needs to be in order to focus in the present moment. This explains why so many golfers miss a putt at the end of the final round or why football players drop the ball inches from the finish line.</strong>They choke because their attention switched from the present and moved into the future. As a result, they lose their focus.Whatever we choose to focus our attention on will make it past the mind&rsquo;s filtering system.<strong> 2. CHUNK IT BY BREAKING DOWN GOALS</strong>Successful people establish their goals. They visualize themselves achieving those goals. And then they break those goals down into tiny, clear chunks.<strong> Successful people understand that clarity gives us certainty.</strong>You and I can also break down our goals into tiny, bite-size tasks and move from there. Small, clear goals keep our attention focused and yet are not enough to stress us out.<strong> 3. LOOK FOR FEEDBACK TO HELP KEEP YOU MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION</strong>In order for feedback to be most effective, it needs to be immediate. The smaller the gap between output and feedback, the more we will know how to perform better. The reason is that our attention does not need to wander because the information is at hand.<strong> If real-time feedback is not possible, find a way to measure your progress. It&rsquo;s important that your feedback loop is timely. </strong>For yourself, and others, tighten the feedback loop as much as possible&mdash;try to make it a daily habit.<strong> 4. STRETCH YOURSELF TO ACHIEVE PEAK PERFORMANCE</strong>You need to stretch yourself to perform to your greatest potential. Exactly how much you need to stretch each time is debatable, but experts generally agree that the <u> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-ebook/dp/B000W94FE6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400435397&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  challenge should be 4% greater than either your skill or your last effort </a></u>.<u> Increased stress will lead to increased performance</u>&mdash;up to a certain degree. When you move beyond the healthy levels of stress, both performance and health will decline.<strong> In high doses, stress can kill us. Ironically, it is also  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes-Dodson_law\" target=\"_blank\">   fundamental to psychological and physical growth  </a> </u> . 4% growth is seen by researchers as the magical tension between challenge and skill. Most of move past 4% increase in performance without noticing, and it&rsquo;s beneficial because this tension keeps us locked in the present and gives us enough confidence that we can do it again. </strong>Our success begins and ends with our mental toughness. We can move toward peak performance once we find ways to use our mind to do it.",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Fully understanding the impact of the female investor on your business is essential to your long-term success. </strong>   In my opinion, the real challenge for advisors is learning how to attract, retain and serve female clients. <br/> <br/> Before taking on those three challenges, I recommend that you first evaluate the actual gender demographics of your practice. That assessment will provide a good measure of your success with attracting and retaining female clients. If your practice reflects U.S. demographics―according to the U.S. Census Bureau's there are nearly 5.5 million more women than men in the country― more than half of your client base would be women. Only after you evaluate demographics of your practice can you move forward with repairing the disparities and pursuing the untapped opportunity. <br/> <br/> Once you've evaluated the actual gender demographics of your client base, the next step is to allow the information to guide you.  Ultimately, you shouldn't just pursue the untapped opportunity, but rather pursue the untapped opportunity in a manner that can be a long-term win-win for all through a multi-faceted, well-executed approach. Like many others, I readily recognize the opportunities presented by building a female client base. The challenge that I think we all agree on is how to genuinely and effectively serve the female marketplace. Recommended next steps include:</p><li> <strong>  Look at your practice: </strong>  Analyze your practice and ask yourself probing questions such as:  How do I stack up? Do I have enough single women clients?  Have I built a strong client relationship with the married women? Then grade yourself on how well you're doing.</li><li> <strong>  Analyze the scope of your local market for women clients: </strong> Find out the depth of the women's market in your community and in your service niche. The more you know, the more you will be motivated to go after it.</li><li> <strong>  Determine your ideal female client: </strong>  Depending on your focus and your community, the ideal client may be younger professional women or older women responsible for legacy wealth.</li><li> <strong>  Connect to women professionals and learn how to connect with female prospects:  </strong> Reach out to female peers! <br/>  </li>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Employee Happiness. </strong></p><p> This coupling of words has been a buzz for quite some time for HR pros, but I am not sure the buzz has been taken seriously simply because it gets on the bandwagon with the other shiny objects that can change the business today. But I am here to tell you employee happiness is one of out the thousands of shiny objects on the bandwagon you need to pay attention to0.</p><p> <strong>  Why? </strong></p><p> Many of us measure employee happiness with just that, whether or not an employee likes their job. However, happiness is manifested in so much more than just liking a job. Happiness is weaved into liking one&rsquo;s position, duties being completed, workload, co-workers, work environment, etc. and not finding enjoyment out of the host of impacts in the work environment can cause stress for someone. Especially as we see more workplaces shift to less people completing more work.</p><p> Stress alone can impact the organization through increase turnover, decreased productivity, and high absenteeism of employees. Lost productivity from employees in the US costs organizations approximately $200 billion each year. And this isn&rsquo;t from employees not being at work, this is on the basis the employee is present, but lacks productivity. If this doesn&rsquo;t wake you up, it should.</p><p> Getting employees engaged in the work they do is not easy, but it does start with the work environment, culture, and relationships. And we know this because we see it time and time again. Take Zappos for instance &ndash; they have created a culture and work environment that has lent itself to create a $2 billion dollar business.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juney\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Juney Ham  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  How to avoid mutually-assured destruction </strong></p><p> My friend Tristan* recently started an IM conversation with the following phrase:</p><p> <strong>  I just made Albert&rsquo;s* fianc&eacute;e cry. </strong></p><p> Oof. I could already tell that this one was going to be a doozy.</p><p> You see, Tristan and I have a bit of a history together. We&rsquo;ve been friends for a long time, and at one point in the mid-2000s, we worked at the same company when he led the engineering team that supported my marketing team. Tristan had always had a reputation among his friends as being a &ldquo;hothead,&rdquo; and at work we ended up having pretty epic disagreements about &hellip; well, basically everything.</p><p> While working with someone like Tristan was stressful, we learned a lot from the experience and became better employees, co-workers and leaders to others as we continued our careers. Nowadays, we&rsquo;ll ping each other for feedback when handling conflict resolution scenarios &mdash; both good and bad.</p><p> However, this one was a bit of a #fail after a long track record of successes:</p><p> <strong>  I literally blew a gasket. </strong></p><p> Anyway she starts saying she&rsquo;s telling me this because Albert can&rsquo;t communicate and is bad at communicating and I went into this long diatribe about like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been friends with Albert for longer in my life than not, and I&rsquo;ve never had a problem communicating with him, and every time we argue it&rsquo;s because YOU decided to insert YOURSELF into a conversation between ME and HIM, and I don&rsquo;t know how many arguments we have to get into before you realize this is a bad idea and never works and you&rsquo;re always creating more problems than you think you&rsquo;re solving!  That&rsquo;s around the point when she cried and said &ldquo;do whatever you want&rdquo; and hung up.</p><p> Even without really processing this, when she hung up I was like &ldquo;&hellip;fuck.&rdquo; So intuitively I knew it was like &ldquo;ok, I could have handled that better.&rdquo;</p><p> Without going into too much detail about the entire saga, I felt he was completely justified in his frustration (even as an outside observer)! Unfortunately, while he had legitimate reasons for being upset, he practically &ldquo;went nuclear&rdquo; with his delivery. It was clear to him that even though his reasons were valid, losing his cool didn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. He still had an unresolved problem and an upset friend&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e.</p><p> I suggested the following, which he thought would be a good thing to write a brief blog post about (which brings us full circle).</p><li> <strong>  First, stay silent. </strong> Don&rsquo;t say anything until you&rsquo;ve taken a few breaths. This is important!</li><li> <strong>  Separate the problem from the emotion. </strong> What is the issue, exactly? You&rsquo;re mad and you want to yell, sure&mdash;but yelling will just get the other party upset, defensive and less willing to end things on a positive note.</li><li> <strong>  You can now start thinking tactically about coming up with a solution. </strong> Armed with a clear head, you&rsquo;d be surprised at how many potential answers stare you in the face.</li><li> <strong>  Speak calmly but firmly about how you feel </strong> , using &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements. An example of an &ldquo;I&rdquo; statement is &ldquo;I felt frustrated because the schedule kept changing&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;you kept changing the schedule on me!&rdquo; This helps keep the other party from getting defensive or feeling attacked.</li><li> <strong>  Propose the solution. Again, speak calmly, but firmly. </strong> You don&rsquo;t need to be conciliatory, but you should definitely present anything as objectively as possible.</li><li> <strong>  Pat yourself on the back because you just averted World War 3! </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Now, not every situation will warrant an approach like this. Death threats, a cheating spouse, or someone eating more than their fair share of cupcakes&mdash;these are all situations where you should rain napalm and activate your Mutually Assured Destruction scenario (kidding).</p><p> However, for most situations, this process might help resolve issues and come up with solutions that work for everyone involved.</p> ",

    "link": "the-path-to-becoming-a-good-female-leader",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  One of the biggest fears that career women normally have is their inability to get noticed by their boss, especially when it&rsquo;s time for promotion. </strong> They are worried that they will be stuck in their current position and will not have the chance to hold a leadership position. Unfortunately, many companies also lack the resources or funding for the professional development or training of their staff. For women in the workplace, a bigger challenge for them is how they could grow, improve, and develop as professionals.</p><p> If this is the same concern that you are having, perhaps it&rsquo;s time that you rely on nobody for your career development and personal growth. Read the tips below on how you could become the kind of leader that you want to be.</p><p> <strong>  1. Deal with your colleagues and managers with integrity and enhance your leadership attitude. </strong> Showing your leadership attitude to your coworkers is one way of proving to your managers you are worthy of a promotion. It is important also that you show discipline by strictly complying with company policies. Be committed to your work and always remember that you are being watched both by your colleagues and your managers.</p><p> <strong>  2. Understand your own strengths. </strong> How confident you are with yourself can be determined by how well you know your own strengths and weaknesses. To become a good female leader, you shouldn&rsquo;t try to be someone else. You have to figure out what makes you special and find ways to make others see it. Don&rsquo;t get intimidated by men especially, because you&rsquo;ve got things they certainly don&rsquo;t have.</p><p> <strong>  3. Be an expert at time management. </strong> One very important skill that every leader should have is time management. It is crucial that you are organized and disciplined enough to finish your tasks and complete your projects on time. Keep in mind that being a leader, the way you manage your time has a direct impact on how productive your team will be. If your coworkers witness your inability to manage your time properly, they will find no reason to look up to you.</p><p> <strong>  4. Educate yourself more about men. </strong> There is no doubt that women leaders are pressured to work in a male dominated workplace. You should be prepared to deal with stereotypes and gender expectations. For you to overcome these challenges, you should try to know what it is exactly that keeps men motivated at work. This way, you can gradually establish respect and trust with your male colleagues or subordinates.</p><p> <strong>  5. Find someone to coach or mentor. </strong> A coach is someone who helps others realize their strengths and potential. By becoming someone else&rsquo;s mentor, you are setting yourself as a good example of a leader. Teaching a mentee about  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/category/career-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  career management  </a> is an effective way of showing your competence as a leader.</p>",

    "title": "Can Coffee Prevent Suicide?",
    "link": "can-coffee-prevent-suicide",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Very few drugs can be shown, convincingly, to be associated with a definite reduction in suicide rate. People have tried to show this for antidepressants, but it isn't an easy connection to demonstrate. To my knowledge, only two drugs seem to show a consistent connection with reduced suicide rate: lithium (widely prescribed for bipolar disorder) and caffeine.</p><p> Lithium's tendency to prevent suicide in high-risk groups (like bipolar patients) is fairly well known, and the literature on this is extensive. I'll save that discussion for another time (or you can refer to the Mania chapter in the book I'm writing on mental illness). <br/> <br/> The results for caffeine are correlational; they do not prove cause and effect. Still, the evidence is intriguing. In 2011, Michel Lucas et al. published  <u>  <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1105943\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a study in   </a>  <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1105943\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   JAMA Internal Medicine  </a> </u>  that looked at 50,739 U.S. women (mean age: 63 years) who were free of depressive symptoms at baseline (in 1996), then prospectively followed up through June 1, 2006. During 10 years of follow-up (1996-2006), 2,607 incident cases of depression were identified. The researchers went back over the data for coffee consumption. They found that depression risk decreases with increasing caffeinated coffee consumption. What's more, they found a clear dose-response relationship. The relative risk was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.95) for those consuming 2 to 3 cups per day and 0.80 (0.64-0.99; P for trend &lt;.001) for those consuming 4 cups per day or more. In plain English, that means a risk reduction of 15% for drinkers of 2 to 3 cups of coffee per day and 20% risk reduction for those drinking more than that. <br/> <br/> Lucas followed up two years later with  <u>  an expanded study </u>  that looked specifically atsuicide risk among coffee drinkers. In this study, Lucas et al. analyzed data for 43,599 men and 164,825 women, covering a period of 20 years for men (14 to 16 years for women), and found a strong dose-dependent inverse association between coffee consumption and suicide, with the risk of suicide 45% reduced for drinkers of 2 to 3 cups per day and 53% reduced for drinkers of more than 4 cups of coffee a day. The researchers corrected for a variety of potential confounding factors, including smoking, antidepressant use, alcohol consumption, age, gender, and marital status. (Read the study to get the full discussion.) Neither tea nor decaffeinated coffee conferred any risk reduction. <br/> <br/> The Lucas results confirm two earlier studies. A 1993 study showed lower suicide risk among coffee drinkers in a longitudinal investigation of over 120,000 individuals who were followed for an average of 8 years ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8275213\" target=\"_blank\">   Klatsky et al. 1993  </a> </u> ). Suicide risk decreased monotonically with increasing coffee consumption, and was 80% lower in drinkers of six cups of coffee per day as compared to non-coffee-drinkers. <br/> <br/> Likewise, a 1996 study involving 86,626 female nurses found suicide risk was 72% lower among women who drank four cups of caffeinated coffee per day as compared to non-drinkers during the first 10 years of follow-up ( <u>  <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=621677\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kawachi et al. 1996  </a> </u> ). <br/> <br/> Before you get too excited, bear in mind that  <u>  <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007614714579\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a research team in Finland found, in 2000  </a> </u> , that suicide risk is 58% greater in people who drink eight cups or more of coffee per day. One can hypothesize that agitation, anxiety, and impulsivity (all of which are likelier if you ingest too much caffeine) may be important effects here. But there are other possible explanations, including the likelihood that people who feel the need to self-medicate with 8+ cups of coffee a day are probably at high risk for suicide for other reasons. Certainly, the evidence is abundant that substance abuse, depression, and suicide are closely linked. Perhaps in a future edition of the DSM we'll see a Coffee Use Disorder diagnosis for people who drink 8+ cups a day. <br/> <br/> The studies aren't definitive. We still can't say for sure that coffee-drinking preventssuicide. But it's starting to look as though it's at least possible that the cheapest, most effective, most widely available suicide-prevention drug in the world might well be none other than caffeine. <br/> <br/> I'm nearly done writing a 115,000-word book on mental illness; please add your name to the <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   mailing list  </u> </a> to be notified when it's ready (and how to obtain free sample chapters).

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The frightening fact is that many service providers are unaware of the level of satisfaction among their clients. </strong> Even if we work hard to ensure that we live up to our commitments, there may be silent relationship-killers undermining our best efforts. For example, there is a very, very high cost of system errors. Something as basic as a delayed statement mailing can dramatically impact the level of satisfaction that your clients experience. This may not seem like much, but I have witnessed that overall investment performance is frequently not the reason a client moves on; rather it is the administrative aspects of the service delivered.</p><p> As your business grows, so does the risk of service delivery experience. Think about your last hotel stay with a brand name chain. The hope of the entire chain depends on the single interaction that you had, either in person or not, with a particular staff member, and how it will drive your entire assessment of that chain.</p><p> Here is a simple solution that can actually bring massive unexpected benefits. During my days of growing a business, we advertised that I, as CEO, would be on the client service desk taking calls from 4:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m., one night a week, for clients to reach me if they had any issues to discuss. The astonishing result was this: about fifteen percent of the calls were from clients wishing to express concern over an unresolved issue, but the other <strong>  eighty-five percent </strong> were calls from clients giving me suggestions and ideas about products and services&mdash;I now had a volunteer marketing department with a vested interest&mdash;our clients! Here&rsquo;s the other value that accrued&mdash;I was able to be a role model for our team. I was able to model for them a particular approach to client interaction that I hoped they would emulate&mdash;and, of course, I learned more than one or two things from them.</p><p> The bottom line is that your management style and thoroughness of understanding the entire value-chain in your organization, whether it is a five-person operation or a major corporation, will become legend, and you will get some great new ideas from your increasing loyal clients.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Time is money. The adage is certainly true if you&rsquo;re spending an insurmountable amount of time and effort writing and revising blog articles.Don&rsquo;t stress about perfection when writing blog articles. Instead, focus on getting your message across clearly and succinctly with these four tips. <strong>  1. Keep a list of story topics </strong> My story ideas come to mind while I&rsquo;m driving, in the middle of conversations, as I&rsquo;m drifting off to sleep, as I&rsquo;m reading other&rsquo;s content. When inspiration strikes you, jot your idea on a master list or editorial calendar. Starting an article is easier when you have a list of topics to choose from. <strong>  2. Identify your best writing method </strong> Find a writing method that works for you. For many writers, this means:Research &gt; Outline &gt; Content &gt; Revise</p><li> Research: what do industry leaders have to say on the topic? Research by professional organizations? Government agencies? Do your research and attribute your findings.</li><li> Outline: there are many options for outlines. Basic outlines could include: intro, thesis statement, short supporting paragraphs, and conclusion.  <u>  <a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Outlining a story around policy debate&rsquo;s stock issues  </a> </u>  works for me. Others like to incorporate storytelling into their articles and use: setting, plot, characters, conflict and theme.</li><li> Content: this is where you simply fill in your outline with content including research, supporting quotes, and personal experience and knowledge.</li><li> Revise:  <u>  grammar and punctuation can affect your message, even how your article is recognized by search engines </u> . Review your article for clarity. Can your points be made more succinctly?</li><strong> 3. Find or Create a Good Writing Environment</strong>Your environment can also play a factor in the speed and quality of your writing. Do you write best in a quiet setting? Do you need music?No matter the environment, try to eliminate distractions and disruptions &ndash; close your door, turn off your cell phone, and close your email and social media accounts.<strong> 4. Set a timer</strong>When you set a timer, you are more willing to concentrate fully on the task at hand. Give yourself 10 minutes to outline, and a 20-minute writing deadline to find focused productivity.Write for 20 minutes. Take a break. Come back to your writing at a predetermined time (schedule it!) and write for another 20 minutes. Repeat as needed.Want to take the &ldquo;timer&rdquo; idea to a new level &ndash; try a program like <u> <a href=\"http://writeordie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Write or Die </a></u>, which provides consequences for procrastination and rewards for producing.<strong> 5. Outsource editing</strong>If you neglect to edit your own writing or feel you&rsquo;re not an objective critic, consider outsourcing editing. Who would you trust with the task: a co-worker, family member, or professional copyeditor? The choice is yours. Inevitably, outsourcing editing takes the pressure off and can result in a better message to your readers. ",

    "content": "<p> <i>  This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog. </i></p><p> You only have a few seconds to make a first impression, and the majority of your website visitors will hit the back button long before they scroll down to get a better idea of your website&rsquo;s value proposition.</p><p> If you are losing the majority of your visitors due to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/b2b-website-mistakes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bad website design  </a> </u> , the costs can be enormous.</p><p> Not only will a high bounce rate penalize you in search rankings, but it can also have direct financial costs since it lowers the chance of converting paid traffic and it makes all of your other organic marketing campaigns less effective.</p><p> No matter how skilled you are at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/7-ways-to-drive-quality-traffic-to-your-website/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   driving traffic to your website  </a> </u> , these three mistakes can turn your website into nothing more than a money pit.</p><p> <strong>  1. Confusing or Vague Value Proposition </strong></p><p> According to leading design experts, your website has less than 10 seconds to convince a visitor to stay on your website.</p><p> Your homepage is the single most visited page on your website, but many companies have homepages that are confusing and fail to get across the necessary information in the 10 second window before users leave.</p><p> The sheer volume of information on the internet has created a society that is profoundly impatient &ndash; and demands immediate satisfaction without having to read through bullet point after bullet point.</p><p> You need to give an &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo; for your company or product on the first screen that your visitors see, and it has to be acutely relevant.</p><p> There have been numerous studies on what makes a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/landing-page-tips/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   high converting landing page  </a> </u>  &ndash; but most great landing pages share a few characteristics:</p><li> There is a clear value proposition that puts the company&rsquo;s purpose and product/service upfront.</li><li> There is an overt &ldquo;ask&rdquo; for the user to take action &ndash; an immediate &ldquo;second click&rdquo; that the user can make to sign up for a trial, learn more, or download something &ndash; thus keeping them on the site and allowing you to serve more content. <br/>  </li><p> The only way to find out what works for your company is through testing &ndash; specifically A/B testing that pits two versions of your website landing pages against each other to see which works better.  You may want to test:</p><li> Which version has the lowest bounce rate</li><li> Which version has the highest call to action click rate</li><li> Which version gets more clicks on the links you want clicked</li><li> How far visitors scroll down the page <br/>  </li><p> Regular A/B testing will help you gradually refine your marketing message and your homepage.</p><p> <strong>  2. Slow Load Times and Errors </strong></p><p> The best designed website in the world isn&rsquo;t going to attract customers if the website doesn&rsquo;t load when someone visits.</p><p> One &ldquo;modern&rdquo; trend &ndash; having a large video or large images that fill a computer screen &ndash; can be deceptively bad for conversion rates if they take too long to load.  Those large images (if not optimized properly) and videos rely on a fast broadband connection to display the content quickly.</p><p> If a website doesn&rsquo;t load for your user in a couple seconds, they are probably going to click away from your website.</p><p> Do everything you can to optimize your site, and to minimize loading errors. Host your site with a fast provider on a server with plenty of processing power and bandwidth, and make sure your hosting company can meet the demands during peak traffic times.</p><p> Compress your images, style sheets and javascript, use server caching, and use just enough media on your homepage to convey your brand message.</p><p> Plan for mobile visitors, and make sure that your content is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/what-is-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   responsive  </a> </u>  and doesn&rsquo;t rely on plug-ins (like Flash or Java) that might not run on mobile browsers.</p><p> <strong>  3. Low Value Traffic </strong></p><p> Finally, one of the biggest reasons for a high bounce rate and low conversion rate is that the people that visit don&rsquo;t have any need for your product or service.</p><p> Some level of poorly-qualified traffic is inevitable. But if you are receiving a large amount of low quality traffic, it might be worth re-examining your traffic generation strategy.</p><li> Don&rsquo;t work with SEO companies that buy links from irrelevant websites.</li><li> Optimize your website for &ldquo;long tail&rdquo; keywords and phrases.</li><li> Bid on keywords that are more narrow in scope.</li><li> Use social networks that are used frequently by your target customer, or use Twitter hashtags that your prospects monitor (instead of your peers).</li><li> Re-examine the keywords that you are using &ndash; and try to use keywords that are specifically oriented to the &ldquo;buy stage&rdquo; of your business. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Take a close look at your website, especially your homepage.  What could you be doing differently to make it more relevant for target prospects? </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/smart-marketing-template.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Most of my clients fall into 2 camps: 1) How can I change myself? 2) How can I change others? Needless to say, those that fall into the first group tend to have a lot more success.</p><p> This may seem obvious. Those that are willing to take responsibility are more willing to change their behaviors, surroundings, and beliefs. But how does that willingness turn into action? In other words, HOW do they actually do it?</p><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s look at some examples of things I&rsquo;ve recently said to clients &amp; friends: </strong></p><li> &ldquo;So you want to have more alone time, but you fill all your time with doing things for others?</li><li> &ldquo;You want to save more money, but you&rsquo;re spending it on things that don&rsquo;t make you happy?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;You want to stop comparing yourself to others, but you just spent an hour social media stalking your ex&rsquo;s new girlfriend?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> You don&rsquo;t need to be a coach to see that most of us engage in self-sabotaging behaviors. We create negative circumstances and then act surprised when things play out according to our actions.</p><p> Most people don&rsquo;t see their actions as a cause and effect. They see it as &ldquo;I want more alone time AND I&rsquo;m doing things for others&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to save money AND I&rsquo;m spending it on things that aren&rsquo;t satisfying&rdquo; Being able to see the &ldquo;but&rdquo; is the key to the simple math of happiness, also known as, addition by subtraction.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the simple truth we like to ignore: A crowded life doesn&rsquo;t create a fulfilling life. We need to stop glorifying busyness. Most of us are busy with things that either:</p><li> Don&rsquo;t make us happy</li><li> Prevent us from doing things that will make us happy <br/>  </li><p> And it&rsquo;s not just the things we do. It&rsquo;s also our relationships and our physical space. Are your friends draining? Is your bedroom floor so covered in clothes that you can&rsquo;t remember the color of your rug?</p><p> <strong>  If you want to create space for your dreams, goals, and passions, you need to: </strong></p><li> Get honest about what you really want</li><li> Take a hard look at the things that prevent you from getting there</li><li> Clear out some space for the magic to happen <br/>  </li><p> Instead of looking at how much of our To Do List we can cram into a day, let&rsquo;s look at how much of our day can be used for the things we actually want.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s my challenge to you: Create a TO NOT DO LIST </strong>  </p><p> <strong>  HERE&rsquo;S HOW: </strong></p><li> Grab a sheet of paper. In Column 1, write out all the things you that you&rsquo;d like to add more of.</li><li> In Column 2 write out the activities you currently spend time on.</li><li> Look at where you&rsquo;ve been saying &ldquo;AND&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;BUT,&rdquo; by drawing lines between each column where conflict might exist. Some items may intersect with multiple items in the other column. For example, spending excessive time on Netflix may impact your sleep, the time you spend reading, and your ability to connect with more like-minded people.</li><li> Look at what changes can be made. What can you scale back on from Column 2? How can you add more of Column 1? What are the creative compromises you can make?</li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/simplemath-insert.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p> And don&rsquo;t worry! You don&rsquo;t have to change things drastically. Not everything needs to be cut. You can find small hacks to create space:</p><li> Want more time to read, but you spend 45 min. driving to work? Take the bus and read or try books on tape.</li><li> Want time in nature, but you&rsquo;re constantly out running errands like buying toilet paper? Use Amazon prime. <br/>  </li><p> Finding the &ldquo;But&rdquo; hidden in your &ldquo;And&rdquo; will help you to master addition by subtraction. And when in doubt: Prioritize what you like. Cut out what you don&rsquo;t. Find creative compromises.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.bluechipcommunication.com.au/author/aliciaeu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alicia Eu  </a> </u></p><p> In the first few months of my career as a comms consultant, I believed that success for my clients equated to media coverage. I quickly learnt that media relations is not synonymous with PR, and that media is simply ONE of many channels that can be used to reach my clients&rsquo; key audiences.</p><p> As a recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/17881.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Savicom&amp;utm_campaign=Is%20PR%20obsessed%20with%20coverage%3F%3B%20Wet%20Seal%27s%20store%20closings%3B%20Social%20media%20goals%20for%20PR%20pros%3B%20Politician%27s%20odd%20demand%3B%20and%20much%20more&amp;utm_term=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prdaily.com%2FMain%2FArticles%2F17881.aspx&amp;utm_content=michelle%40bluechipcommunication.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u>  in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Home.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PR Daily  </a> </u>  reminds us, PR is &ldquo;a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organisations and their publics&rdquo;.</p><p> With that definition of PR in mind, think about the way information consumption habits have shifted in recent years. Traditional channels for communication, like broadcast and print news, are no longer seen as the leading information source. We now need to think of the individual as being at the centre of all channels &ndash; both print and online.</p><p> If we are to build &lsquo;mutually beneficial relationships&rsquo; with our audiences, we must remember that media relations isn&rsquo;t a standalone means to reach them. We should look at an integrated omni-channel approach that segments and targets the audiences we want to communicate with according to their consumption habits.</p><p> There is also an opportunity to educate business executives to look at how PR is supporting them in reaching their end goal. Rather than merely counting article numbers, PR can help them achieve their business goals, be it through generating leads, making sales or educating.</p><p> An omni-channel approach also allows us to look at different tools of measurement, particularly online. For example, we can now look at where leads are generated and who is engaging with our content. At the end of the day, it is this sort of data and analytics that will help us show the true value of our work as PR consultants.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; media relations is still a very important component of many PR programs &ndash; it can offer third-party validation and can help build and protect a brand and its reputation. But as Kevin York, Founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://kevinyorkcomms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kevin York Communications  </a> </u>  said in his PR Daily article, PR will lose some of its business relevance when it becomes too reliant on media coverage. We must integrate other communication channels to &ldquo;solve problems, meet business objectives and both support and drive sales&rdquo;.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  We identified investor education as one of six hot topics. </strong> Why? Because we think teaching your clients about investing will help you build trust.</p><p> But what kind of education should you offer? What do your clients want? Here are three tips to improve your investor education efforts.</p><p> <strong>  1. Start at the beginning </strong></p><p> Where are you going to start? Even before explaining a mutual fund, examine the importance of saving.</p><p> &ldquo;Why is saving so important?&rdquo; is an important question that many current and would-be investors don&rsquo;t have a clear answer to. An added bonus is that you can speak about this subject without getting into technical language.</p><p> Lay a strong foundation in &ldquo;Saving 101&rdquo; and then build your way up to mutual funds.</p><p> Suggestion: Create a  <u>  microsite </u>  with videos and accompanying one-page brochures.</p><p> <strong>  2. Engage them </strong></p><p> How are you going to engage your clients and prospects? Try &ldquo;gamification.&rdquo;</p><p> Doesn&rsquo;t it seem like we learned a lot more and a lot faster when we were children? One reason why was that we were learning in a much more interactive manner.</p><p> Enter  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification\" target=\"_blank\">   gamification  </a> </u>  &ndash; interactive learning that is fun, challenging and goals-based. Sites like www.khanacademy.org use design elements and the mechanics of games to improve learning, helping people retain more information and offering a better user experience.</p><p> Suggestion: Create quizzes built around a story &ndash; and make sure you reward people with points and certificates.</p><p> <strong>  3. Stick with them </strong></p><p> How are you going to do this? By planning for the long term.</p><p> Investor education isn&rsquo;t a sprint, it&rsquo;s a marathon. A three-month education campaign just isn&rsquo;t enough because if people see that you are light on content, they may question the value of getting involved.</p><p> Educating your clients will take time and cost money, but we believe it is an unmatched opportunity for financial services firms to build trust and get their clients engaged in their businesses.</p><p> Suggestion: Create a detailed  <u>  editorial calendar </u> , and be prepared to produce comprehensive briefs and find data to back up your requests.</p><p> To provide top-notch investor education to your clients and prospects, provide truly informative material, deliver it in a creative and engaging way, and stick by their sides for the long haul.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  It would be nice to think that careful financial planning is behind the critical decision of when to start collecting Social Security benefits. </strong></p><p> But psychological traits &ndash; perhaps impatience or one&rsquo;s fear of losing money &ndash; can also affect whether an individual claims his benefits right at age 62 or waits a few years to increase his monthly income from Social Security.  A new study reveals another powerful influence that can jeopardize financial security: how a person&rsquo;s dollar benefits might appear on the printed Social Security statement.</p><p> Business professors Suzanne Shu at UCLA and John Payne and Namika Sagara at Duke University tested this on people over age 40, controlling for psychological influences on the research subjects, such as their impatience, loss aversion, and expectations of how long they&rsquo;ll live.</p><p> In the first experiment, some people were shown tables presenting their monthly Social Security benefits for each claiming age from 62 to 70 &ndash; this layout highlights the  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/getting-what-you-need-for-retirement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   significant benefit increases  </a> </u>  that come with each year of delay.</p><p> A second set of subjects saw more complex tables displaying their total potential benefits accumulated over their entire time in retirement, which depends on both the age they first claimed and on how long they&rsquo;ll live. This presentation emphasized a different aspect of the decision: the later someone claims and the longer he lives, the more money he&rsquo;ll receive over many years. Die young, however, and the accumulated benefits are higher for those claiming at 62.</p><p> The experiment&rsquo;s outcome was significant. The cumulative tables &ldquo;make people want to claim earlier&rdquo; &ndash; six months earlier than people shown the tables with monthly benefits &ndash; Shu said during a  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/about-us/events/2014-retirement-research-consortium-meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent presentation  </a> </u> .</p><p> In a second experiment, the researchers used eye-tracking software to identify where the subjects focused their eyes on tables that displayed their potential benefits. These tables, shown below,  presented monthly Social Security benefits at various claiming ages in the left-hand column, while total benefits were in a matrix, based on the subject&rsquo;s claiming age (by row) and how long they might live (by column).</p><p> Those who decided to collect benefits early &ndash; between ages 62 and 64 &ndash; focused on much different figures than those who decided to claim later.  The early claimers spent far more time &ndash; 13 seconds &ndash; studying their monthly benefits at age 62 (shaded dark orange in table below). They also spent more time on their cumulative benefits, if they were to live to just 73.  They only glanced at the total benefits they would receive if they live into their 80s or 90s.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"182\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/table-1.png\" width=\"828\"/></p><p> In contrast, the late claimers focused most intently on their monthly benefits at age 66 &ndash; 8.4 seconds &ndash; and on their cumulative benefits if they lived to age 83.</p><p> &ldquo;Information presentations do have a big impact on people&rsquo;s intentions and on how they use information in decisions,&rdquo; Shu concluded.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/table-2.png\" width=\"858\"/></p><p> These findings may be useful to financial planners or policymakers trying to help people make good financial decisions.  The personal lesson here: carefully consider all the options before signing up for your Social Security benefits.</p>",

    "title": "Thinking Inside The Box",
    "link": "thinking-inside-the-box",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve all heard about &ldquo;thinking outside the box.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a tired expression really. </strong> &ldquo;You need to put on your innovation hat! You need to think outside the box!&rdquo; OK, true enough I guess. But actually, we live in a real world with real constraints. We are, truth be told, in a box. There are timelines, there is physical space, there are responsibilities, there are budgets. Yes, we can solve problems with new ideas that are transformative. But arriving at those ideas, the pathway to uncovering those ideas isn&rsquo;t as straightforward as people seem to imply. If it was, many more people would be SteveJobsian. But Mr. Jobs was a special case indeed. He had the money, the space, the authority, to step outside the box and create a pristine environment where he had tons of white space to invent the future. It was the same with Bill Gates and his famous Think Weeks.</p><p> <strong>  For most of us though, our jobs come with a big list of minimums. </strong> Track your time, file your expenses, answer email, buy lunch for the team, manage up, manage down, write this report, develop this point of view, complete this budget. That&rsquo;s what you get paid for. To deliver. That&rsquo;s your box. And it takes 9, 10, 11 hours a day including time before and after the work day and on weekends.</p><p> <strong>  Make no mistake. It&rsquo;s a good box. </strong> The company creates value for its customers and shareholders and you&rsquo;re part of that process and you are compensated and appreciated for your part. It&rsquo;s all good. But, with this box that we&rsquo;re in, how do we invent the future? Simply put, you need to make a bigger box. Here are some ways:</p><li> <strong>  Find some whitespace.  </strong> Maybe you can&rsquo;t break away for a two day retreat. But you can block out two hours and disconnect. It&rsquo;s important to do both. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://petapixel.com/2014/10/20/john-cleese-shares-inspirational-speech-creative/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Cleese points out  </a> </u> , it takes a half  hour just to get in the right rhythm.</li><li> <strong>  Work at it. </strong>  No, I mean really work at it. Stick to it. Dig. There&rsquo;s a false platitude out there that says these ideas just switch on like light bulbs. That&rsquo;s rarely the case. Mostly it takes persistent, perpetual, habitual, pushing, pulling, digging, uncovering, connecting, abandoning, retrying. Sometimes, if you&rsquo;re not getting anywhere, keep going. It might mean you&rsquo;re almost there. Great ideas sometimes come into view slowly.</li><li> <strong>  Be visual. </strong>  It&rsquo;s not all about words. It&rsquo;s not all about listing thoughts on a whiteboard. It&rsquo;s not. We are all visual people. Draw. Doodle. Make crazy diagrams and connections. Print out pictures and put them on your walls. Use Pinterest to collect visual cues to the ideas you resonate with. Inspire yourself and others with art! Sometimes, adding beauty, adding the visual element, is the only way a brilliant idea gets a heartbeat.</li><li> <strong>  Listen. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t interrupt. Just don&rsquo;t do it. Let people talk, pontificate, get out all of their thoughts. Then, ask one simple question. And listen some more. Your team is full of ideas. But ideas follow a journey in real time. Those ideas can be developed and created in real time. But only if you give them room to breath. Create a culture in the room of letting people work out their thoughts live, in real time.</li><li> <strong>  Read. </strong>  Yes, read. As Joseph Addison so aptly put it, &ldquo;Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.&rdquo; Aldous Huxley said, &ldquo;Every man who knows how to read has it in his power to magnify himself, to multiply the ways in which he exists, to make his life full, significant, and interesting.&rdquo;  <a href=\"http://www.innovationexcellence.com/blog/2014/03/03/if-you-want-to-innovate-read/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   If you don&rsquo;t read, you really can&rsquo;t innovate  </u>  .  </a> Simple as that. Make sure some of the space in your box contains a library. You don&rsquo;t have to read every book either. Skimming books provides innumerable inspiration. It&rsquo;s true that one of the constraints of the box is time. It&rsquo;s tough to find time to read a 300 page tome. So skim. Underline. Pick out relevant chapters right out of the middle of the book.</li><li> <strong>  Self Talk. </strong>  Try your ideas out verbally in private. All by yourself. Out loud. You need to let them flow out of you. You need to hear yourself present them, try out different formats, different patterns, let your hearing mind be your own critic and creator. Maybe it&rsquo;s in the shower, maybe it&rsquo;s while driving, maybe you take a walk. But put your ideas out there in verbal form and see what they look like. You&rsquo;ll be amazed when it comes time to present them how much cleaner and more organized and articulate you&rsquo;ll be.</li><li> <strong>  Connect.  </strong> This one&rsquo;s easy but so often avoided. Find like-minded people and fuel each other&rsquo;s thoughts. 1+1 = 3 in this case. It is true that many people will be pessimists and randomists (that is, they feel the future is merely random luck). Avoid them. Can you put a dent in the universe? Yes you can. Connect with other future sculptors and start chipping away. Small chips over days, weeks and months turn into your David.</li><li> <strong>  Diverge. </strong>  Get outside your scope. It&rsquo;s a very uniform world indeed. Beethoven, Matisse, Chihuly, Musk, Gladwell, you, me. In many ways we&rsquo;re all working on the same things. How can we create something of value, for our families, for ourselves, for our companies, for society? Find as many masters as you can outside your specific discipline and get to know their paths.</li><li> T <strong>  ranslate. </strong>   <a href=\"http://technologycreated.com/2013/11/29/remembering/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   From history  </u>  . </a>  Not so much your own history. The history of innovation, invention, creativity. How has it been done in the past? Steam engine (Watt), automobile (Ford), energy company (Edison). Same planet, same human characteristics, different mediums, different technology. Translate. Go.</li><li> <strong>  Persistence. </strong>  Duh. This should really be #1. The world will tempt you to give up, to accept that the box you&rsquo;re in just doesn&rsquo;t allow for breakthrough ideas, successes. It&rsquo;s not true. But the number one reason why isn&rsquo;t the world or the box. It&rsquo;s us. It&rsquo;s that we stop when we&rsquo;re right on the doorstep of that breakthrough. Keep. Going. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  You live within constraints. </strong> To acknowledge that in a real way is the way forward. But to stretch those constraints, to speak out the future in terms of possibility, this is the path to innovation. As TR would say &ldquo;Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell &lsquo;em, &lsquo;Certainly I can!&rsquo; Then get busy and find out how to do it.&rdquo; Go for it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A friend of mine has been having problems with someone on her team for awhile now. The guy has been missing deadlines, making errors and missing a lot of work. Before the holidays, she wrote him up for these issues. When we met up for lunch right before the year ended, she said she thought the warning had done the trick. She believed he would get focused and turn things around in 2014.</p><p> When we met up for lunch right after the first of the year, she said things were going well. His work and attendance got a little better. She made sure he knew that she recognized the effort and improvement. She even approved his annual increase. She thought these things would reinforce the positive behaviors.</p><p> However, when we met up for lunch last week, things with him were worse than ever. His attendance and performance had fallen off again. Work was piled up and she was working overtime to catch things up. She had completely lost confidence in his ability to do the job. She was starting the search to replace him.</p><p> And she was wondering did her attempts at positive reinforcement cause him to think everything was all better and slack when she really wanted him to keep pushing?  <strong>  Did her compliments and rewards cause his demise? </strong></p><p> I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p> On the one hand, I can understand wanting to encourage the guy when she saw him doing better. Getting in trouble with the boss is no fun and, when that happens, we all want to feel the security of good grace as soon as possible. And we all want the person who supervises us to praise our efforts and results. She was trying to be that kind of manager &mdash; and I think workplaces need more people like that.</p><p> However, giving too much praise too soon and/or rewarding someone monetarily so soon after such a fall-off in performance wasn&rsquo;t the best move. She probably should have held off on his annual increase until he produced more consistent performance results. The praise combined with the pay increase undermined the prior warnings &hellip; Sure, you don&rsquo;t want to hold a performance hiccup over someone&rsquo;s head forever &mdash; but 90 &ndash; 150 days is a better guideline than 60 days or less.</p><p> <strong>  In the end, his demise is really no one&rsquo;s fault but his own. </strong> Showing up, on time for the days you are scheduled and accurately completing the tasks assigned to you on time is the foundation of work life. People who cannot do these basic things will not remain employed in any job.</p><p> When that happens, you may just have to wish the guy the best in their future endeavors and move on.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In catching up with some old friends and co-workers in the past few weeks I have been made aware of the fates of some &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; that I had the pleasure of being subordinate to at various times in my career. These leaders I speak of were dastardly, vile creatures who took great pleasure in harassing me and others- while collectively trying to destroy the careers of innumerable colleagues of mine.</p><p> <strong>  The power trip was glorious once upon a time. </strong> They never thought it would end. Day after day they sat in their offices, in meetings plotting the many ways they would make their employees&rsquo; lives miserable and they got away with it. Claims of harassment and unfair treatment were swept under the rug as they smirked and pranced out of conflict mediation meetings to discuss employee complaints. They were careful not to commit too many infractions in public- like cowards often do- they resorted to closed door tactics.  The legacy of their leadership was founded on the dismissal of people&rsquo;s ideas or concerns, belittling employees in meetings, making grown adults cry because they were made to feel their work was never good enough, and having employees carted out of the office on stretchers because the combination of the job and these leaders caused anxiety, ulcers and other ailments.</p><p> <strong>  By the way this was all in HR. </strong></p><p> Year after year, we discuss the virtues of what it means to be a leader-yet very little changes. It does cause one to question how seriously organizations take the need of having competent, effective and kind leaders at the helm. By and large, companies have done well to get the competent and effective part right, but the lack of kindness and humility at the top is startling.</p><p> In each of my jobs, I have done well to see when the writing was on the wall. My career spidey sense has allowed me to jump ship right before shit hit the fan. Many of my co-workers will also remember me saying before all of my departures that these toxic leadership regimes would not last forever. In some cases, the fall from glory was quick and shocking-yet for others it has been a long, painful journey.  I am a firm believer of the idea that you get what you give in life and that also holds true in business.</p><p> If you lead with negativity and malice in your heart, that karma will come back to bite you. Alternatively, if you choose to lead with dignity,  <a href=\"http://thearistocracyofhr.com/does-humility-have-a-place-in-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  humility </a>  and positivity this too will be your legacy and follow you as you progress in your career.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t have to tell you that the people that I speak of are now out of the very roles they abused and on the unemployment line. While I am sorry for their current imposition, I am far more disappointed in how common this narrative is in the workplace.</p><p> With this realization in mind, I urge leaders everywhere to remember the following:</p><li> <strong>  Your employees today may be in a position to lead you tomorrow. </strong> Be careful how you treat them.</li><li> <strong>  Power is a dangerous thing. </strong> Do well to ensure that you are using your leadership power for good, because it comes back to you.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t let organizational politics change who you are as a person or a leader. </strong> Rely on your values before playing the political game.</li><li> <strong>  Organizations are cyclical. </strong> You may be on top for a time, but there will come a time when you are not. Let your time in leadership be something that inspires rather than something that becomes fodder for &ldquo;what not to do as a leader&rdquo;.</li><li> <strong>  Trying to destroy your employees&rsquo; careers will only lead to the destruction of your own career. That&rsquo;s leadership karma. </strong></li>",

    "content": "<p> This is the third part from the book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Alive-Journey-Reengage-Career/dp/1935953648/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423159376&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coming+alive+the+journey+to+reengage+your+life+and+career\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Coming Alive: The Journey to Reengage Your Life and Career  </a> </u>   by Ruth K Ross.  </p><p> <strong>  Why are managers like accordions? </strong> Have you ever thought about how an accordion works? In order to make a sweet sound come out of that cumbersome instrument, both sides need to be embraced in perfect harmony.</p><p> If you apply more pressure to one side than the other, you won&rsquo;t exactly hear sweet music. But if you play the instrument precisely as it was designed, the sound it produces will be beautiful. So what does this have to do with employee engagement?</p><p> Think about it this way. Engagement is like a two-sided instrument such as an accordion. The left keyboard stands for top management, handing down a mandate to produce more in a faster timeframe, all the while keeping resources flat or even reduced. The right key- board stands for employees. They require more of management&rsquo;s time, energy, and support. Each side relies upon the other for sweet music to be made. And therein lies the lasting conundrum. How are managers supposed to keep both of these sides playing in harmony, creating in-tune music together resulting in increased productivity, higher customer satisfaction, and increased revenue?</p><p> Managers can&rsquo;t play a harmonious tune if even one person on their team is disengaged. It&rsquo;s like trying to play a song on a piano missing a key. In today&rsquo;s tough business environment, managers can&rsquo;t afford to have a team working for them that is not fully engaged. Even worse, if your manager is operating on a low battery, then how can you expect him to charge and reengage others?</p><p> Most disengagement is silent unless someone is actively disengaged and wants everyone around them to know it (and potentially harm the organization along the way). As we&rsquo;ve talked about in prior chapters, there are many ways to spot the symptoms and diagnose the disease. Our goal should be to think prevention first, rather than having to get out the cardiac-arrest paddles when it might already be too late. How do we get ahead of the curve and limit the number of people who are choosing to &ldquo;quit and stay&rdquo; in their chairs? How do we make sure that everyone is alive and healthy in the workplace? How do we ensure that the accordion is played properly? I&rsquo;ve got the cure.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I met with a former colleague the other day to discuss his wealth management firm&rsquo;s marketing message and capabilities. The firm has experienced strong, steady growth since its inception, largely due to the hard work and strong reputations of its partners and some smart acquisitions. But now that the partners are approaching retirement and a new generation of advisors has been tasked with maintaining the firm&rsquo;s growth trajectory, their marketing deficiencies have become a problem.</p><p> The tricky part is convincing the partners that the firm needs to invest in marketing today when it never had to before. They built a successful firm and careers without any kind of strategic marketing. Why should they start doing it now?</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s why&hellip; </strong></p><p> <strong>  Your competition is  </strong> &ndash; <strong> </strong> The financial services industry was late to this party, but it&rsquo;s now common to see even small firms with clearly defined brands, great websites, slick user experiences and high visibility in multiple media. These companies tell great stories that illuminate and engage their audiences.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s crowded out there </strong>  &ndash; The advisor community has experienced some consolidation and the pace of retirements will soon be picking up, but anyway you look at it there are a lot of companies and advisors all competing for the same clients. Anything that gives your advisors and edge &ndash; makes them more memorable or more credible &ndash; can make all the difference.</p><p> <strong>  Who you are is just as important as what you do </strong>  &ndash; Unless you really do have a one-of-a-kind planning or investment strategy, the surest way to win new business is by expressing your firm&rsquo;s unique sense of purpose, the qualities that define your character. You&rsquo;re working to win the trust of investors, a challenge that demands a real conversation about real people&rsquo;s hopes and fears. You have to show them you understand. You care.</p><p> <strong>  You have to get &ndash; and hold &ndash; people&rsquo;s attention </strong>  &ndash; There has never been more competition for your audience&rsquo;s eyes and ears. Getting through to them when and where you stand a chance of making an impression is hard. You need a plan, a message, a style and a system for making adjustments to capitalize on wins and correct underperformance.</p><p>  </p>",

The fastest growing demographic is the 55-64 year age bracket, which has grown 79% since 2012.</p><p> <strong>  Are you reaching the fastest growing demographic online? </strong></p><p> Social media is everywhere, and it is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/infographic-growth-social-media-2014-financial-insurance-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   growing in all demographics  </a> </u> . Some social network sites have user bases larger than the populations of most world countries. People are increasingly basing their purchase decisions around a business or individual&rsquo;s online presence. The growth of older generations using social media has been staggering over the past three years. In fact, the 50 and over age group is the fastest growing demographic online, and constitutes a majority of the online consumer population.</p><p> This Infographic from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.accredited-online-college.org/internet-usage/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Accredited Online Colleges  </a> </u>  looks at the Internet and social media usage amongst the older generations:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/older-generations.jpg\" width=\"315\"/></p><p> <strong>  So, what does this mean for financial and insurance advisors? </strong></p><p> It is easy to overlook the importance of Social Media in an industry such as Finance or Insurance however; everything we know about Social Media applies to these industries as well. Your clients and prospects are online and they are searching for news and helpful information. Social Media is an excellent and effective channel to engage with these prospects, build trust and position yourself as a thought leader in the industry. Share tips, discuss recent news, offer advice, and expand your reach online through sharing helpful content.</p><p> Investors often picked Advisors based on trust and the ability to build relationships . Think about it this way. Who would you trust more? The Advisor who is open about their business and expertise on Social Media, discussing industry updates, insights and advice. Or an Advisor, without a website or with a website that only publishes the services they provide and contact information.  The older generations have the most spending power, of any group, so it is important that they are being reached through the channels that they are using to make their buying decisions.</p><p> Social Media has become an essential part of the lives of millions of people around the world, and is a powerful platform to reach all demographics.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Want to know the secret to customer retention? I'll tell you, but first a story.  </strong> <br/> <br/> I grew up on a farm in Ohio and, as a young girl, had many horses over the years. One of my horses was named Rusty, and he was what many would call \"barn sour\" and \"herd bound;\" he either didn't want to leave the barn or leave the other horses. I hadn't thought about this horse or those terms in a long, long time, until I stumbled on a story the other day about a barn sour horse. <br/> <br/> I do sometimes find inspiration to write about both customer and employee experiences in the strangest ways, but that story got me thinking about this blog post that I needed to write about customer retention and how to keep customers coming back. For the horse, his desire to stay in the barn was clearly driven by the fact that he loved his food, his stall, and his companions. All the things that made him feel comfortable and loved. <br/> <br/> Probably not so different from what keeps your customers coming back, too. <br/> <br/> If only companies we do business with understood that - if only they knew what they truly needed to do to keep us coming back, to keep us feeling loved. If only they would shift the ratio of acquisition : retention focus to be more about to how to keep the customers they already have than on how to acquire new/more customers. <br/> <br/> I've posed this question before: What happens when companies spend huge sums of (marketing) dollars on customer acquisition when they can't even keep the customers they have because their products, services, and experience stink? <br/> <br/> I don't think I'm going out on a limb here to say: \"Customer retention is paramount to acquisition!\" As a matter of fact, this isn't an original thought at all. The stats speak for themselves.</p><li> A 5% reduction in the customer defection rate can increase profits by 25-95%. -Bain &amp; Co/HBR</li><li> A 2% increase in customer retention has the same effect as decreasing costs by 10%. -Emmet and Mark Murphy</li><li> The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%. The probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20%. -Marketing Metrics</li><li> Customer profitability tends to increase over the life of a retained customer. -Emmet and Mark Murphy</li><li> 55% of current marketing budget is spent is on new customer acquisition and only 12% on customer retention. -McKinsey</li><li> It is 6 to 7 times more expensive to acquire new customers than it is to keep a current one. -White House Office of Consumer Affairs</li><li> A 10% increase in customer retention levels result in a 30% increase in the value of the company. -Bain &amp; Co</li><li> Most important marketing objectives? 29.9% think it should be customer acquisition, and 26.6% think it is customer retention; however, 62.2% admit that they concentrate on customer acquisition, with only 20.6% focusing on customer retention. &ndash;Emarketer</li><li> 80% of your future profits will come from just 20% of your existing customers. -Gartner</li><li> A 10% increase in customer retention yields a 30% increase in the value of the company. -Bain &amp; Co</li><li> Repeat customers spend 33% more compared to new customers. -Laura Lake <br/>  </li><p> And yet, companies continue to focus on sales, sales metrics, and customer acquisition. It becomes a never-ending vicious cycle, if you can't keep your current customers. In talking to clients about the perils of focusing more on acquisition and sales rather than on the experience and retention, I like to say: \"As fast as you're bringing new ones in the front door, current ones are running out the back door.\" Some refer to it as the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/09/the-leaky-bucket-syndrome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   leaky bucket syndrome  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> I don't get it. Don't get me wrong; I do know that acquiring customers is important, I just wish that companies would put at least as much effort into keeping the customers they already have. If they did, they wouldn't have to work so hard to get new ones. Not that they wouldn't need them - you always need customers to keep the business alive - but your existing customers would become an extension of your sales force and do some of the work for you. And save you money! <br/> <br/> So, what should companies be doing? Here's a hint: <br/> <br/> 82% of consumers in the U.S. said they stopped doing business with a company due to poor customer experience. -RightNow</p><p> To focus on delivering a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/12/a-remarkable-customer-experience-trumps.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   great customer experience  </a> </u>  (which you know by now I've  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/11/when-you-take-care-of-your-customers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   defined  </a> </u>  as memorable, remarkable, personalized, emotional, and consistent), companies must improve the customer experience. How? Here are some tips.</p><li> <strong>  Know your customers. </strong> What's their story? Who are they, what are they trying to achieve with your products or services, and how are they going to do that or use them? Personalize the experience for them, as well... knowing them means never having to ask!</li><li> <strong>  Map the customer journey. </strong> Understand the steps they walk to get the job done, to do what they are trying to do when they interact with your company. You can't improve the experience without first knowing what the experience is.</li><li> <strong>  Be easy to do business with. </strong> Simplify the customer journey and your processes along the journey. Don't forget about the multichannel experience and the omnichannel experience.   </li><li> <strong>  First impressions are important. </strong> Everything from truthful advertising to the greeting at the door or on the phone - if you make a great first impression, you're well on your way to delivering a great customer experience.</li><li> <strong>  Exceed expectations. </strong> Customers have expectations about your products and services, whether those come from advertising, reviews, or what they've heard or what they know about your brand. Your brand promise sets those expectations. Without question, live the brand promise, be remarkable, delight, and do so every time.</li><li> <strong>  Hire the right people. </strong> Don't just hire them, train them and make sure they know what your expectations are for delivering a great customer experience. </li><li> <strong>  Remember that the employee experience drives the customer experience. </strong> There's  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/12/this-trumps-customer-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a ton of proof  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/12/this-trumps-customer-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>      </u> </a> to support this premise.</li><li> <strong>  Communicate your purpose. </strong> This simplifies the hiring process and both customer acquisition and retention. Both customers and employees want to be aligned with brands with purposes and values similar to their own.</li><li> <strong>  Listen to your customers. </strong> Always. In whatever mode they want to speak to you or provide feedback. Pick a metric and measure it, but don't focus on the metric - focus on the improvements. Listen, learn, act, and improve.</li><li> <strong>  Build long-term trust relationships. </strong> Not transactional or opportunistic relationships.</li><li> <strong>  Communicate. </strong> Early, often, proactively, honestly, candidly, and transparently.</li><li> <strong>  Quality. </strong> Don't forget that if you sell crappy products or deliver crappy services, customers won't come back. Period.</li><li> <strong>  Be different. </strong> In a world of commodotized products, delivering a great customer experience is a differentiator. Figure out why customers (would) choose your products and services over others.</li><li> <strong>  Last and lasting impression. </strong> Appreciate the customers you have. Always say \"thank you.\" In words and in actions. <br/>  </li><p> I know the title of this post states that I'm going to tell you a secret. Ready? What's the secret to customer retention?  <strong>  You need to work at it; it's earned, not assumed. </strong> <br/> <br/> The brands that succeed wildly don&rsquo;t just give people a reason to choose, they give people reasons to believe and to belong. And they work hardest of all to give people more ways to matter. -Bernadette Jiwa</p>",

    "content": "<p> (First, apologies for starting this new adventure off on a blue note. Truthfully, I&rsquo;ve had this 90% written for about a month, and my brain has just flat refused to let me do anything else until I put this out into the world.)</p><p> I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been feeling it where you are, but the new year has felt heavy to me this time around. Like one of those hulking winter coats from a thrift store that smells kind of funny and never fits you quite right. There&rsquo;s sorrow and loss around every corner, it seems, and I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if my heart can survive it.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not even talking about the big guns like ISIS and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30708237\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Charlie Hebdo  </a> </u> , or even Ferguson &ndash; the huge, gut-wrenching calamities we can&rsquo;t begin to comprehend, let alone cope with. No, these are closer &ndash; intimate personal tragedies that hit much too close to home, sinking their teeth into your tender spots and leaving you bruised and utterly bewildered. More dear friends and family members than I can wrap my brain around have lost parents, grandparents, friends or beloved pets already this year &ndash; and it&rsquo;s only February. Others are dealing with unimaginably hard things in their lives that can only be described as staggeringly unfair. My husband&rsquo;s 36-year-old barber died of a heart attack 3 days into the new year. In what universe does that make sense?</p><p> Of course there&rsquo;s never a &ldquo;good&rdquo; time to go through something this bottomless and dark, but starting the new year on such a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVadl4ocX0M&amp;list=RDpVadl4ocX0M#t=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fugue-like note  </a> </u>  has left me in a strange place, one that&rsquo;s too quiet, too aware. I&rsquo;m trying to hold tight to what I have while making room in my heart to grieve all of these losses at once. Turns out, that&rsquo;s quite a lot to carry.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve caught myself squinting into the distance, hoping to catch a glimpse of the bigger picture or anything resembling meaning &ndash; something to gain from all this loss. But the light is faint, and sometimes it feels a bit like a mouse pointing a flashlight into the abyss. What can little old I possibly hope to illuminate in all this darkness?</p><p> After hearing that someone we love had lost her father suddenly, a dear friend said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re too young to lose our parents.&rdquo; And she&rsquo;s right of course. But when are we old enough? For any of this? We&rsquo;re too young, too fragile, too human for any of it. To be losing our friends, our partners, our colleagues, our pets&hellip;it&rsquo;s just too much.</p><p> All I know is that I don&rsquo;t know much of anything. There are no answers, and the sorrow I feel for these people whose lives will never be the same sits heavily on my shoulders. But I&rsquo;m hoping against hope that somehow in the great karmic game of Hot Potato, my wearing all of this grief for a while lightens the load for someone else, even for a moment or two.</p><p> So, what can you do? When you&rsquo;re faced with so much and feel so helpless? That&rsquo;s the Big Question, of course. We all want a solution, so very badly. A + B, carry the 1, and that will get you straight to C. But Big Questions never have Easy Answers. To be honest, this is where I stopped writing last week. Because I was stumped. And platitudes&hellip;well, a pinch of Hallmark is better than nothing, but it seldom gets the job done.</p><p> The other day, when the cashier at my little neighborhood post office was as close to tears as a man gets in public over the loss of his friend, the aforementioned barber, he shrugged and said, &ldquo;What can we do but move on?&rdquo;</p><p> Now just a minute, I told him. Not so fast. Sit with your grief for a while. It&rsquo;s okay. Miss your friend, honor his life, and feel the loss before you file it away. And though I feel like I almost never have the right words, the look of relief on his face when I said this to him makes me think it might have helped just a little.</p><p> The next day, though my heart was still heavy and I was in no place to be social, I found myself chatting with the handyman at my building as he strolled by. Out of nowhere, and having almost nothing to do with anything we were talking about, he suddenly said to me, &ldquo;Just do the best you can with today.&rdquo;</p><p> (I tell you, almost without exception, profound comes from the one place you absolutely never expect to find it.)</p><p> The more I thought about it, the more his words just sort of wriggled their way through the dark, twisty places in my head and took root. Do the best you can. Just for today. Whatever&rsquo;s happening, whatever&rsquo;s brought your heart low&hellip;instead of wondering how you&rsquo;ll ever manage to solve the world&rsquo;s evils, focus on any small thing that would make even one dark corner just a tiny bit brighter. Compliment someone. Buy a stranger&rsquo;s latte.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mesothelioma.com/heather/lungleavinday\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smash a plate  </a> </u> . Just do the best you can with today.</p><p> With those wise little words still wriggling around in my ears, we &ndash; my heavy heart and I &ndash; came home and sent flowers to my friend whose father died. Then we made a coffee date with a friend who&rsquo;s struggling, and sent a loving email to another. And after that, we called my great aunt, whose son died just before Christmas, to let her talk about nothing at all for as long as she needed to.</p><p> Nothing was fixed, of course &ndash; loved ones were still gone, struggles were still there. But we&rsquo;d done the best we could. And when I hung up the phone, my heart and I felt just a little bit better. For today.</p>",

(Note: this advice is NOT for would-be novelists or memoir writers.)</p><p> Your driving reason for writing a book is not to tell your story or explore your creative muse (although you&rsquo;ll need to do both), but to drive your business.</p><p> The question you struggle with is this: should you dedicate hundreds of hours of your time researching, writing, editing&mdash;and let&rsquo;s not forget marketing&mdash;your book? Is it the right investment for you?</p><p> <strong>  Well here&rsquo;s the rub. Before a book can drive ANY business your way, you have to add value to your audience. Clear, compelling value.

The last thing the crowded, over-saturated book marketplace needs is another big fat yawn.</p><p> But if you&rsquo;ve clearly got something to say, well, the beauty of book-writing these days is that you can make a book pay for itself in a myriad of ways.

You know their triggers and can write as though you&rsquo;re speaking directly to them.</li><li> You&rsquo;re ready to build a digital platform, including using social media to drive future clients and buyers to your virtual doorstep. The beauty of Book as Social Proof is that you don&rsquo;t have to start with a built-in audience&mdash;you can grow it as you build your content.</li><li> You&rsquo;re willing to laser focus on your expertise&mdash;go deep and be THE expert, willing to invest the time and energy to be ahead of the curve and, occasionally, take on the pretenders-to-the-throne. This also has the side-benefit of making you like catnip to the media. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Book as Solidifier.  </strong> This book is almost an after-thought, typically written after you&rsquo;ve ALREADY achieved some fame and plenty of revenue for your expertise. The goal is normally to introduce a wider audience to what has been a high price point service or product. Jeff Walker, the creator of Product Launch Formula is an excellent example. He built a multi-million dollar highly successful on-line business&mdash;typical price point: $2,000&mdash;but wrote a $10 book that encapsulates much of his thinking (and made the NY Times Bestseller List). Exposing his ideas to a wider audience gave him a whole new pool of potential prospects for his programs.</p><p> This might be for you if:</p><li> Your goal is to expand your reach beyond your typical buying audience.</li><li> Your goal transcends money (if it was only about money, you could make more of that by plowing your book-writing hours into your core business). It&rsquo;s really about influence. You want to direct the conversation in your niche in new ways, building a bigger platform. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Book as Game-Changer. </strong>  This book is the big kahuna&mdash;the one everybody strives for. It&rsquo;s the breakthrough that allows you to do anything from speaking to inventing deep business models that leverage your talents best. Timing helps, but don&rsquo;t kid yourself. The folks that have been successful in this arena not only work hard at their craft, they tend to be unwaveringly focused on creating value for their core audience. Think Dan Pink, Seth Godin, Tom Peters or Michael Port of &ldquo;Book Yourself Solid&rdquo; fame.</p><p> This might be for you if:</p><li> You&rsquo;re writing for an audience you can almost feel&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that visceral.</li><li> You can dedicate the time (and the money if you&rsquo;re self-publishing) to do this right.</li><li> You have an established platform&mdash;email list, social media, media contacts in your niche&mdash;or are going to make a concurrent commitment to build a well-constructed one.</li><li> You are willing to work with an editor who won&rsquo;t always tell you what you want to hear, but will make your work 10 times better than it was without her.</li><li> You understand that marketing your book begins when you&rsquo;re writing it, not when you&rsquo;re done.</li><li> You already have a business model that allows you to fully exploit the success of your book OR are ready to create one. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Writing your book&mdash;launching your ideas out into the universe&mdash;is an exciting, fascinating, soul-stirring time. By all means, fully embrace the process. </strong></p><p> Just know that if your goal is to create a book that sells&mdash;whether you measure it in copies sold or revenue from your other services and products&mdash;creating the right strategic plan BEFORE you commit is an excellent investment.</p><p> Tweetable Question: Have you considered writing a book? What stopped you cold or made you pull the trigger? @ConsultingChick</p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Remember, the fish starts stinking at the top </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s right, it always does. And when it comes to the sales process it&rsquo;s not different. CEOs need to understand, embrace and support the sales process. If your CEO expects immediate results and you are stuck in a sales cycle that takes 3-6 months, guess what will happen? Your CEO will question you, your boss, your team and that&rsquo;s usually where the panic starts.</p><p> <strong>  Always get buy-in from your CEO </strong></p><p> Why? So there is no surprises. While I preach that CEOs should not meddle with the sales process once it is established, I also feel that the process needs to be developed, agreed upon and fine tuned with the CEO in the room. It&rsquo;s a cultural shift that will build a trusting environment where everybody involved in sales knows the parameters and the name of the game.</p><p> <strong>  Everybody is in sales </strong></p><p> Everybody within your organization should have a sales mindset. Why? Because you are constantly selling and building trust. Everybody who is client facing, and I mean everybody is responsible for the reputation of your company. It&rsquo;s hard to sell when people don&rsquo;t trust. If I visit a client and the receptionist is not friendly, that leaves a negative impression.</p><p> If I then talk to a customer representative and they are not knowledgeable. Guess how that will impact my decision to buy?</p><p> And if I then get referred to a sales person who pitches something that I don&rsquo;t need, because they don&rsquo;t listen, they just &ldquo;sell&rdquo; it will probably make me think about buying anything from that company. Right?</p><p> Your people are selling all the time, in a direct or indirect way. So, they need to understand that their livelihood is directly tied to their demeanor, mindset and behavior. Our training program helps companies to establish a common Sales &amp; Service language. No matter who you encounter within the organization, they should all speak the &ldquo;same&rdquo; language.</p><p> <strong>  Train your account people </strong></p><p> When we think about the sales, we think about sales people, database management, phone calls, etc.</p><p> But, if your account people are charged with growing revenue within existing accounts and they are not trained to do that, they will most likely resist it.  Most opportunities are right under our noses. It&rsquo;s the trusted clients we work with who are most receptive to our new service offerings. But if your account people feel that they are only responsible for account management and they are uncomfortable talking about new business, the up-selling will be difficult.</p><p> <strong>  Help your CEO with driving directions </strong></p><p> CEOs are visionaries, they know where they want to end up, but it is up to his people to provide the map. CEOs often don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with details, but if they are presented with a concept that helps everybody within the organization to become more focused on new business development (which will result in additional revenue), they will open up their ears. Our most successful training programs are the ones where the CEO agrees with the philosophy and his/her leaders drive the direction.</p> ",

    "link": "ten-steps-to-successful-presentations",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> So, you&rsquo;ve been asked to give a presentation? Perhaps&mdash;for the first time&mdash;to senior management or even the board of directors? These steps will take you from content selection to post-delivery feedback. You&rsquo;ll be able to give better presentations and get better results.</p><p> <strong>  Focus your topic. </strong>  You can&rsquo;t say everything in one presentation. The more you try to include, the less your audience will be able to remember. Resist the temptation to include every data point. Resist the urge to incorporate everything you know about the subject. What do you most want the audience to understand? That&rsquo;s what you need to put in.</p><p> <strong>  Understand your audience. </strong>  Are you presenting a budget to a few associates seated around a table? Addressing a large audience at a major conference? Hosting an international conference call? Consider the demographics of each audience: age range, educational backgrounds, professional goals, etc. Consider the psychology of each audience. What do they want to hear from you? What do they worry about hearing from you? Do you need to break bad news?     Adjust your content, your PowerPoint and your speaking style to suit the unique personality of each group.</p><p> <strong>  Target your research. </strong>  Use a wide range of research: interesting statistics, personal anecdotes, powerful examples, lively quotations, clever definitions, references to the day&rsquo;s news, client comments (&ldquo;Yesterday I received an email from a client asking about &hellip;&rdquo; ), real-life comparisons and visual illustrations all work here.</p><p> <strong>  Organize your material.  </strong> Make your presentation easy to follow. Give it a strong beginning, an orderly middle, and a strong ending. Don&rsquo;t fade away at the end. A tip to help you improve your structure: Make sure your ending directly relates to your beginning in some way. Does your last PowerPoint screen echo your first? Do your final sentences reinforce your opening sentences? Does your concluding call to action reinforce your opening goal?</p><p> <strong>  Speak in everyday language. </strong>  Make it easy to understand. Avoid legalese or bureaucratese. Use plain English: short words, clear sentences. Look at your PowerPoint. If you have full sentences on the screen, you&rsquo;ve got too much verbiage. No audience will read through a wordy screen. Cut ruthlessly. Read your presentation out loud several times. If you find yourself stumbling over awkward phrases or tripping over complex sentences, rewrite those lines.</p><p> <strong>  Give it style. </strong>  One financial professional told me, &ldquo;I never paid much attention to presentation style. I&rsquo;ve always thought the numbers mattered most.&rdquo; Yes, the numbers matter. But any presentation can be improved significantly by using a few simple speechwriting devices:</p><li> Repetition: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how we benefit. Here&rsquo;s how we all benefit.&rdquo;</li><li> Rhetorical questions: &ldquo;What happens if you do nothing?&rdquo;</li><li> Triads (expressing items in groups of three): The most famous triad you&rsquo;ve probably ever heard came in President Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg Address: &ldquo;government of the people, by the people, for the people.&rdquo; But any financial presentation can benefit from the same triad technique: &ldquo;We need to investigate, to explore, to question.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Use humor with great care (if at all).  </strong> You will never have the opportunity to &ldquo;undo&rdquo; a tasteless joke, and you will never have the opportunity to &ldquo;redo&rdquo; a botched punch line. So think before you use any humor. Remember: Humor should not be gratuitous. If used, humor has to blend into your remarks. Above all, understand that humor should not offend the audience in any way.</p><p> <strong>  Allow adequate time for rehearsals.  </strong> Good presentations require practice. It isn&rsquo;t just what you say, it&rsquo;s also how you say it. Analyze the way you use your voice, body language, eye contact and audio/visual aids.</p><p> <strong>  Consider the attention your presentation might generate. </strong>  What do you want your audience to remember? What do you want them to tell their colleagues? Write down your marketing goals and then make sure your presentation has the memorable lines you need to impact your listeners. A good presentation includes quotable phrases (sound-bites). The most concise and clever sound-bites get tweeted, re-tweeted, quoted, noted and repeated. This produces valuable attention for you and helps market your organization. Positive attention will multiply your message, increase your professional network, and help you build a strong reputation in the finance field.</p><p> <strong>  Seek feedback. </strong> A presentation doesn&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum. It exists in conjunction with an audience. Find out: Did your audience like your presentation? Did they find it interesting? Do they see you as an authority? Do they respect your expertise? You can get valuable feedback by providing written evaluation forms at your session, offering online evaluation forms, or simply speaking informally with attendees in the days following your presentation.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The findings of a powerful research study emerged in the Harvard Business Review last year and it&rsquo;s clear from the behavior of some companies I&rsquo;ve visited recently that word has not been disseminated widely.  The article was titled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/09/the-truth-about-customer-experience/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Truth About Customer Experience  </a> </u> &rdquo; and in it the authors Alex Rawson, Ewan Duncan, and Conor Jones noted that customer satisfaction at transactional touch points with your brand may positively distort how customers truly feel and more importantly how they behave toward your company.  Here is the lynchpin conclusion of their work:</p><p> &ldquo;In our research and consulting on customer journeys, we&rsquo;ve found that organizations able to skillfully manage the entire experience reap enormous rewards: enhanced customer satisfaction, reduced churn, increased revenue, and greater employee satisfaction. They also discover more-effective ways to collaborate across functions and levels, a process that delivers gains throughout the company.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The power of those two sentences is so profound I need to unpack their content. </strong>  Customer experience is not about winning a few battles it is about winning the entire war.  A victory with a cut-over in one silo of the business may result in transactional satisfaction that has little to do with repeat business with that customer; particularly, if the customer is dissatisfied in another silo or is neglected in between what a company views as &ldquo;moments-of-truth.&rdquo;    Success at touch points does not necessarily translate to roll-up measures of emotional engagement or loyalty.  Doing well at key moments in a badly designed process or customer journey may get you a few positive satisfaction scores but also a customer ripe to churn to a competitor.</p><p> <strong>  The big message here is measure both the overall experience with roll-up metrics and satisfaction at touch points. </strong>  Work to design, refine, and execute the end-to-end customer journey.  Don&rsquo;t be content with transactional success&hellip;your customer&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Competition for clients has always been there, but as investors age, something you might not have anticipated can happen. </strong> The vultures are out there. Competition with you for their invested assets can become an increased threat when an older client&rsquo;s judgment is compromised. With impaired judgment, they might fall for the &ldquo;free meal&rdquo; seminar, a device to get them to buy an inappropriate product.</p><p> An older client who has always behaved a certain way about her investments can go through changes because of cognitive decline. You have absolutely no control over this process and in fact, you may not even notice it initially.  <a href=\"http://www.agingparents.com/financial-abuse-elderly.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Cognitive impairment </a>  can come on very subtly at first. What it can do over time is to cause your client&rsquo;s ability to make good judgments about finances to go downhill.</p><p> <strong>  A person who is actually ok financially may start to worry unreasonably that he is going to run out of money. </strong> Or a spouse gets ill and the costs of care skyrocket, making your client think he needs to do something fast to get a high return on his investments. There are a lot of slick salesmen out there who know this and count on it. They are the first ones to offer your client a free meal and a so-called &ldquo;financial education seminar&rdquo;.</p><p> According to FINRA research, 64 percent of those responding to a survey of people age 40 and over had been invited to an &ldquo;educational&rdquo; seminar with a free meal offered. FINRA, the SEC and state regulators conducted more than 100 examinations involving free-meal seminars. <br/> <br/> They found that in half of the cases, the sales materials contained claims that appeared to be exaggerated, misleading or otherwise unwarranted. <strong>  And fully 13 percent of the seminars appeared to involve fraud. </strong></p><p> These highly polished and sleazy sales people are more than happy to tell your client that they can do a lot better for the client than you are doing with your old, conservative and safe investment strategy. They dress well, have engaging personalities and are looking for someone who is fearful or easily manipulated. That could be your client. No matter how educated, smart or experienced your client is, anyone can suffer from loss of cognitive ability. Aging investors may not be as sharp as they were in a younger day, due to memory loss or other issues. The early warning signs of memory loss also suggest erosion of financial judgment. That can lead to impulsive purchases and lack of financial judgment about the risks.</p><p> <strong>  What can you do about this? </strong> You have an opportunity to do a campaign with all your older investors which can enhance your image, increase the frequency of contact with them and educate them in the process. It could be a series of emails or personal letters. Remember that FINRA has issued a warning to all investors to be wary of the free meal &ldquo;educational&rdquo; seminar. You are the good guy or gal, bringing them this important information from regulators who want to protect them. The body of your email or letter can contain this information:</p><p> For every consumer, note these points FINRA wants you to keep in mind before you attend any &ldquo;investment&rdquo; or &ldquo;financial education&rdquo; seminar, especially with a free meal.</p><li> <strong>  Investment seminars are intended to sell you something. </strong> Their purpose in not merely educational.</li><li> <strong>  Beware of the persuasive effect of a high end venue, an expensive meal and a smooth, well-dressed presenter. </strong> These are collectively designed to impress you, but it does not mean that the opportunity being pitched it right for you.</li><li> <strong>  Find out who is really sponsoring the event. </strong> At times, insurance companies, mutual funds or other companies offering their products are behind the pitch, financing the event and expecting that the speaker, who could be someone you know or recognize, will use the event to drive sales of their products.</li><li> <strong>  You can use FINRA&rsquo;s Broker Check (800) 280-9999 to see if the presenter is licensed to offer financial products. </strong> If the sponsor is an insurance agent, find out if he is licensed through your state department of insurance or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. You can find out information about the one offering products for sale through your state&rsquo;s securities regulator or the North American Securities Administrator&rsquo;s association at (202) 737-0900. <br/>  </li><p> Feel free to copy this right into a letter to your clients today. Vary it with your own words and headline. Anyone age 50 and up would be a good candidate to receive it.</p><p> <strong>  Stay in communication with your aging clients. </strong></p><p> Let them know you are concerned about the prevalence of these offerings by supposedly qualified people and ask if they&rsquo;ve been solicited to attend any of them. If they tell you they want to go to a seminar, dig deeper. Ask questions. Offer to check out the presenters. If you step up the frequency of contact, particularly with an automated system of emailing your clients, you can only enhance the relationships you have with them. And in the process, you can not only build loyalty but perhaps save some of them from being seduced away from your responsible management by educating them about potential financial danger.</p><p> We encourage you to comment and share your own stories so that we all can become better informed and educated about new scams and ways to protect our older clients and family members.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If asked how well you understand your business, you can probably boast how well you know and manage your clients. You can forever talk about how good you are at managing money and giving investment advice.</p><p> It&rsquo;s great that you understand the front end of your business. <strong>  What about the back-office? </strong></p><p> The place that keeps your business up and running</p><p> The role of the back-office has evolved from an administrative role to servicing clients, processing information and managing the business.  The back-office does not get the credit it deserves for your business&rsquo;s success.  This may be because you are not 100% sure what goes on back there. Here are 5 things you should know about your back-office.</p><p> <strong>  1.  &ldquo;Operations Professional&rdquo; is not an oxymoron </strong></p><p> Gone are the days when &ldquo;back-office staff&rdquo; is associated with &ldquo;administrative assistants.&rdquo; Your staff probably comprises of college graduates and may have a CFA or CFP.  They are the ones who enter your trades, understand the CRM, and know how to retrieve information from your portfolio accounting and reporting system.  They are your interface to custodians, vendors, IT staff, and other service providers.  Depending on their skillset, they may also serve as your Constant Contact writer, website designer, and PowerPoint expert.  These employees need to be considered as an integral part of your firm.</p><p> <strong>  2.  It&rsquo;s about the number of accounts the back-office is servicing, not the number of households you are managing </strong></p><p> While it is common for advisors to talk about clients in terms of households, or families, the back-office must service each account.  Your 400 households can easily translate into 2,000 accounts. For every one household, the back-office can be servicing a joint account, two IRAs, and three children&rsquo;s trust accounts.  Your software tools store data at the account level &ndash; data gets consolidated to the household level.  Your staff ensures all transactions are handled properly at the account level &ndash; though the staff reports household level information to you.</p><p> <strong>  3.  Though not considered &ldquo;rainmakers&rdquo;, a good back-office helps keep clients happy </strong></p><p> Servicing clients should be considered at least as important as bringing in new clients.  However your back-office is structured, the goal is to ensure that client retention rates remain high.  A good back-office staff may know more about your clients than you think and may be the first to sense a client&rsquo;s pattern (i.e. recurring withdrawals).  The staff should be included in developing ways to enhance client services.</p><p> <strong>  4.  When developing the firm&rsquo;s work-flow processes and procedures, make sure they streamline the operations, not create more bottlenecks </strong></p><p> Work-flow process is currently a popular topic for advisors (either through the CRM or other software). However, the built-in flowcharts, or procedures, may not be right for your firm.  The steps may be too detailed or are not aligned with your firm&rsquo;s organizational structure.  If there are steps currently not being done, review whether they are necessary for compliance.  If compliance is not a factor, review whether the additional steps will streamline the process or have the opposite effect.</p><p> <strong>  5.  Utilizing outsourcing services still require back-office review </strong></p><p> Hiring outsourcing firms can ease the burden on your back-office and increase its efficiencies. However, a review process needs to be implemented so that their services are being monitored. The back-office also needs to ensure that all client transactions were properly executed (i.e. correct trades were placed), client information is correct, and reports are accurate.  Clients will be looking to you for answers, not the outsourcing service.</p>",

    "link": "dancing-to-our-own-beat",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The world we live in today is open. Yet most people still have the same conversations with the same people and wonder why nothing changes. It is those who don't want to be like everyone else who are often misunderstood by a society where conformity is the norm.</p><p> I'll give you an example. I recently went to an event, which was a celebration. We arrived from the rain and the traditional cocktail party was taking place but what was different was that I felt I was with people I adored, friends who shared an amazing life changing experience of being in the heart of the earth in the Amazon Rainforest. There was a shared purpose of a bigger mission around the world we live in to ensure all people and cultures survive.</p><p> I felt happy and connected although I only knew 20 percent of the people there. We were ushered into a beautiful and magical ballroom where about 20 tables were set. We headed toward our assigned table and settled in. The MCs for the evening came out to ease us in and let us know when it was our turn to get our dinner from the buffet, which was spread across three corners of the magnificent ballroom. They told us it was an opportunity to connect in conversation yet they had a full agenda for the evening. We were inspired and entertained and afterwards it was time to dance. Many of them needed an outlet to celebrate their hard work.</p><p> The second the music started, everyone jumped up and headed to the dance floor. I could tell the people who just wanted to let go and have their bodies take them to the freedom of being one with the music. I wasn't one of them. I was tired and happy to sit still and watch the passion of the people who loved to dance unfold in front of me like a musical. I sat back for the first time that week and breathed. The music and watching all these amazing people truly let go and have fun was  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ayelet-baron/whats-your-enough_b_5564338.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  my enough </a> . I was content.</p><p> But for some reason, my past returned to haunt me. I have spent so much of my life today allowing myself to be who I am and not be influenced by the right thing to wear, the right thing to say or the right way to be. I no longer care about fitting in. I don't like to dance in public. It's not my way of letting go. I am perfectly happy dancing on my own and my favorite place to dance is in water. Some people like to swim 100 laps in their pool, I love to dance and move in the pool. I have been married twice and at both weddings, there was no dancing. And I had two divorce parties where I traveled to reflect and maybe danced one night in beautiful Santorini in the ocean.</p><p> For some reason, my choice to enjoy my evening the way I wanted to was an issue for other people who kept trying to drag me on the dance floor. I enjoyed watching them let go and have fun the way they enjoyed it. But they assumed I was not having fun because I was not doing what they were doing. Was I simply transported back in time to school where I was expected to do everything possible to fit in?</p><p> My empathy lens came on where I decided to put myself in their dancing shoes. Their intent was pure. They wanted me to enjoy dancing because they were having a great time. They saw me sitting alone at the table and assumed I needed some coercion to get on the dance floor. I did twice when people I hugely respected and loved dragged me on. But as soon as they weren't looking, I slipped away since I didn't feel a need to be dancing at that moment in time. I just wasn't in the mood to dance and that was okay by me.</p><p> I was blissfully happy enjoying the evening my own way. I am still processing my trip to the jungle and am at a creation point in my life so I cherish those moments of tranquility where I can let go and show up as me. I am in a million situations where my need to show up is often misunderstood in a world where being like everyone else is the norm. A world where people don't realize we are wasting our energy being jealous of other people and recognizing that everyone has issues and a story. That story makes us who we are and then we have a choice as we get older to choose who we want to show up as. I will mostly show up as the woman who loves to watch others dance. And maybe just maybe once or twice, you will find me on the dance floor when it is what I want to do.</p><p> One of the biggest gifts we have in life, if we have our emotional and physical health, is the power of choice. When we figure out what makes us happy -- whatever that may be -- it is okay to be different. In a world that tries to make us like everyone else, knowing our enough when it comes to money and adventures helps bring that peacefulness in our lives. And like anything in life, it takes hard work to allow ourselves to show up and simply be. Every one of us has different needs and being clear helps us enjoy our journey. What do you need to be able to dance to your own beat?</p>",

That is the V in VOICE.</p><p> No matter all of the leadership roles we play, identifying what really matters to us is critical if we want to live a life of true alignment.   Not understanding or knowing what our core leadership values are, can be like a ship without a rudder&hellip;listless and just floating along&hellip;bumping into rocks, needing a tug or a push, and certainly lacking purpose and direction.  Have you ever felt like that?</p><p> In our daily life, whether we know it or not, we are constantly in situations where how we react, how we feel, how we engage with others are all determined by our core values.</p><p> Maybe it is somebody who is stating their opinion that we agree or disagree with. Maybe it is somebody who is doing something in front of us that we agree or disagree with.  Or maybe it is somebody who is asking us to do something that we agree to do&hellip;or perhaps not want to do (but we do it anyway).   Any of these scenarios call upon our values, our belief system, to determine how we react and feel.</p><p> <strong>  So how can you tell if you are living a life aligned to your values? </strong></p><p> Have you ever felt conflicted about doing something?  Or wanting to speak up because you don&rsquo;t agree?  Or feeling tired and drained after a certain experience or perhaps after engaging with a certain person? Or getting a feeling deep down inside that you know something is wrong? Or even feeling regretful about something you said or did?</p><p> This list can go on and on&hellip;but these can all be signs that we are running up against our values.  That something is out of alignment.</p><p> Those of us that work in an office setting can be surrounded by stated values all of the time, these organizational values tell us how we are supposed to act or think.  These values are sometimes on framed posters around the office or we carry them on a laminated card. Have you ever worked in an environment where the values of the organization are not aligned to your set of core values?  How does that make you feel? Each day thousands of people go to work at a place that they do no trust or respect&hellip;not the best place to do your best work I would think.  Have you ever worked at a company like that?</p><p> Our values are our inner GPS, our core belief system that guides our decisions and behaviors.  Most of the decisions we make on a daily basis derive from our values, whether we are aware of it or not.  Think of the different roles we may play in life.  As a parent, as a student, as a leader, as a partner&hellip;each of those roles has a set of values that determine how we act out those roles in life.</p><p> <strong>  Push yourself to remain genuine to who you are and what you represent&hellip;it&rsquo;s not that hard. </strong>  It is much harder to maintain a facade and not be true to your values and your purpose.</p><p> Living a life that is aligned to your values can mean living a life with purpose and commitment.  It doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything will work out splendidly all the time or that you won&rsquo;t have obstacles in the way or challenges to deal with.  But if you are aware of your core values and live your life true to them, you will be much better prepared with the confidence and the muscle to get through and thrive from any challenge life throws at you.</p><p> Finding your VOICE as a leader means discovering your core VALUES; creating a compelling vision to get the OUTCOMES you want; building relationships with INFLUENCE and credibility; making decisions that use your COURAGE to stand alone; and communicating your overall EXPRESSION for lasting impact.</p><p> Life is too short not to use your VOICE.  What are you waiting for?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Denis Story </u></p><p> For years, we&rsquo;ve discussed millennials as if, at best, they were some sort of novelty. Or, at worst, an annoyance, a temperamental demographic that lived as cultural aliens.</p><p> (Full disclosure: Born in 1970, I sit squarely in the middle-child generation known only as X, as if we were a simple unknown in the equation sandwiched between the almighty Boomers and the up-and-coming Millenials. We might not be as revered as our elders, but we get nowhere near the attention our successors do. In short, I&rsquo;ve got no dog in this fight.)</p><p> But Millenials are much more than a niche audience brokers are forced to deal with or employers have to live with. In fact, according to the latest data from the number-crunchers at Pew Research, Millenials will hit 75 million strong this year, surpassing the dwindling Boomers as this country&rsquo;s largest age demographic.</p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, this group &mdash; loosely defined (for now) as those born between 1981 and 1997 &mdash; continues to grow because of the burgeoning young immigrant population, according to Pew. While Boomers, obviously, are starting to, well, die out.<br/> <p> We&rsquo;ve already seen the impact Generation Y (see, they even have two nicknames) has had on the national stage, playing a huge part in electing Barack Obama not once, but twice. Love him or hate him, his campaign managed to speak to Millenials on their level, through late-night talk shows, social media and viral videos. The last two elections have had less to do with either the message (change) or the messenger (old white guys vs. a younger black man) than the medium itself.</p><p> And the trend is bound to continue until the Republican Party apparatus can catch up to the machine the Obama campaign managed to put together.</p><p> Hell, even Hillary &mdash; a longtime frontrunner &mdash; fell victim to Obama&rsquo;s strategy. Her campaign was as old school as the Beltway itself. The best thing that could happen to the Republicans in 2016 would be for her to run. At least the playing field would be level again, demographically speaking.</p><p> But I actually didn&rsquo;t mean to talk politics this time, despite the president&rsquo;s penultimate State of the Union speech tonight. I honestly think it&rsquo;s largely irrelevant. He&rsquo;ll propose a dozen things Congress will never agree to, even if they agree with it.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.benefitspro.com/2015/01/20/obama-to-push-retirement-reforms?ref=hp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Tax reform </a>  is the perfect example. All of us &mdash; even my regular online trolls &mdash; can agree our tax code is onerous to the point of parody. Its comical in its complexity while tragic in its lack of fairness. And in this era of hyper partisanship, Democrats and Republicans alike agree it needs to be fixed. Aside from giving themselves raises and days off, what else do politicians agree on these days?</p><p> But, more importantly, brokers and employers alike have to realign their thinking when it comes to Millenials. They are the new Baby Boomers. We just haven&rsquo;t caught up to that yet.</p><p> How long have we catered to Boomers, politically and economically? And how much has that short-term patronization cost us as a nation in terms of long-term viability. Social Security is the world&rsquo;s shakiest Ponzi scheme. Our energy policy is as antiquated as it is short-sighted. Our minimum wage, which Boomers could actually live off of back in the day, has deteriorated in real dollars as quickly as our national debt has ballooned.</p><p> Boomers &mdash; and to a lesser extent Xers &mdash; have lived like frats boys and sorority girls &mdash; leaving Millenials to clean up the house and nurse our hangovers.</p><p> No matter what Obama says, followed by the GOP&rsquo;s eye-rolling retort, nothing will change. Until it has to.</p><p> I liken it to the broker community&rsquo;s outrage over health care reform or even advisors&rsquo; hand-wringing over Dodd-Frank. We saw it coming. We knew &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; was unsustainable. But we keep going because business was good for brokers and life was easy for carriers.</p><p> Now it&rsquo;s not. The rules have changed. And instead of playing the game, we just want to pick up our ball and go home.</p><p> Sounds like a lot of Boomers I know.</p>",

    "link": "5-pivotal-prospecting-methods-for-financial-advisors",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p>Successful advisors know that prospecting is the lifeblood to continued growth for a financial practice. Yet, competition is getting stronger and to remain competitive, advisors need to employ new prospecting strategies in order to capture new assets and remain viable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prospecting is the method of proactively stepping out of your comfort zone and requires regular attention. While many advisors have some tried and true methods, it&rsquo;s a good idea to try a few new ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some crafty, leading-edge ideas to reach your target market and potentially bring in new clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Shake Up The Referral Tree</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Business is going good and clients are happy, but the number of qualified prospects in your pipeline has dwindled. Now what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t expect your clients to do the heavy lifting while you sit back and wait for the referrals to come in. Take time to rethink your approach. Define your <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/how-to-create-an-ideal-client-profile/\" target=\"_blank\"> ideal client persona </a> and develop a process to communicate the characteristics of your ideal client to everyone you know.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Implement a referral shake up campaign</li>\r\n\t<li>Identify connections of ideal clients you would like to be introduced to and ask for an introduction</li>\r\n\t<li>Plan and host client/referral only events</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Showcase Your Expertise</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your clients know you&rsquo;re an expert, but you need to proactively position your expertise in front of prospective clients. In addition to self-proclaiming your expertise on your website and other promotional materials, you must demonstrate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid generic industry messages when trying to appeal to specific groups of people. While market updates and commentaries add value, they don&rsquo;t always resonate with everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Choose and focus on a niche market</li>\r\n\t<li>Develop a strategy with targeted messages that draw your audience in and make them feel as though you are talking directly to them</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Connect With the Next-Generation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As aging clients transfer their wealth to the next of kin, firms are struggling to retain those assets. Research shows a very small percentage, just 2% to 15%, of clients&rsquo; children will retain the financial advisor their parents use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statistic is alarming! What you have seen as your usual revenue source is going to change. Advisory firms need to pinpoint a strategy that will balance serving existing clients with another strategy to connect with young investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Provide Immediate and Accessible Information:</strong> Next-Gen investors will find the information they are looking for. YOU need to be the one providing it.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Master a Variety of Communication Channels:</strong> Young investors prefer informal communication. You need to engage with this audience through texting, online meetings, Skype, and smart phone applications. Offer clients an option of meeting choices; online or in-person. They are much more likely to connect with you online first and then in-person once trust is established.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Expand Service Offerings:</strong> Overconfidence and required minimum account balances have stifled advisors from reaching out to Next-Gen investors. Offer a wide range of services and products to meet various investment levels and stages of entry points.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Build Your Prospect List Through Social Media</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Often times, advisors use social media to share articles or promote products and services. This type of content is beneficial; however you need to incorporate a method to build your prospect list.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Post messages that direct your online community to your newsletter sign up or LinkedIn group</li>\r\n\t<li>Manage your list by creating segments based on demographics and specific needs of the group. This will position you to provide valuable information, whether it be articles, products, or whitepapers that are tightly knit to the interests of your market.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Start Blogging</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Advisors who self-publish through blogging can reap multiple benefits that establish a solid online reputation, improve client communication, attract new prospects, and position you as an industry leader. Blogging is a subtle way to promote your expertise while increasing your online visibility and presenting an opportunity to establish trust and build relationships with prospective clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create articles and whitepapers that address the financial issues and challenges facing each of your niche markets</li>\r\n\t<li>Group specific topics together and share your resources by posting your blog to social media channels and your website</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I know I said there would be 5 pivotal prospecting methods, but I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. This final suggestion is too good to leave out:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>BONUS IDEA: Start Your Own MeetUp Group<strong> </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Meetup Group is a local community of people where face-to-face meetings happen in real life between members and organizers. Get creative and host a meeting geared toward a specific topic. Plan to meet regularly and discuss topics in your area of expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here&rsquo;s to your success!</h3>",

It can become quite overwhelming if we spend a lot of time on the internet or watching television. It can also have a major effect on our minds and influence our attitudes, behaviors which can have a major effect on our lives.</p><p> This why what Bruce Lee say&rsquo;s is such a great attitude to keep in mind whenever we are listening to other people, reading blogs, social media newsfeeds or watching TV and videos.</p><p> <strong>  #1. Absorb what is useful. </strong></p><p> If you find the information extremely value or with some type of validity then absorb it and you can use in your life further down the line.</p><p> <strong>  #2. Discard what is not. </strong></p><p> If the information you are seeking or reading does not on the other have what could be useful then discard it completely and move on.</p><p> <strong>  #3. Add what is uniquely your own. </strong></p><p> Every individual who is grown and able to think for themselves has something unique to bring to the world including you.

    "content": "<p> In the movie When Harry Met Sally Meg Ryan asserts to Billy Crystal that women can fake their orgasm well enough that the man would never know whether or not they were really feeling it. Crystal doesn't believe her, so she proceeds to demonstrate for him, clutching the table, moaning and yelling to a horrified Crystal right there in the diner. The punchline is delivered by a woman sitting at another table, too far to have heard the conversation building up to it but plenty close to hear the commotion. She waves to a nearby waitress and says \"I'll have what she's having.\"Is that the response you get when you tell someone your value proposition or one of your clients describes what you do to someone else? (I mean the other woman in the diner, not Ryan writhing and screaming. Although if you get Meg Ryan's reaction please call me because I'll pay you to teach me what you tell people.)So often when I hear an advisor describe what they do it is a recitation of facts and services. Informative but not very exciting. The whole point of having a value proposition you can tell people is to make them excited about what you can do for them. Not to understand what you do but to understand how they would be better off by working with you. Something that provokes their interest. When your client tells a friend about you, the response you want them to have is &ldquo;I'll have what she's having.&rdquo;When someone asks you what you do, do you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a financial advisor&rdquo; or &ldquo;We work with pre-retirees on their retirement plans&rdquo;? Or do you tell them how your target clients&rsquo; world is changed because of the special skill or experience you provide? When your clients refer their friends to you, do they say &ldquo;we really like our advisor, we have had a good experience with her, she provides us good service&rdquo;? Or do they say &ldquo;we are so lucky to have found our advisor &ndash; we did not think we would ever find someone who could have done this for us, and it is exactly what you just were describing. You HAVE to call her so she can do it for you, too.&rdquo;According to  <u>  Julie Littlechild </u>  your clients refer you about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.absoluteengagement.com/blog/growth/youre-getting-referrals-you-just-dont-know-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   15 times more often than you realize  </a> </u> . I believe the reason is because your clients talk about you like that first example. If they described their relationship more like the second example, that is, essentially grabbed the table and shouted praises about what you had done for them, I bet a lot more of those people would call you to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have what she&rsquo;s having.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;That Isn&rsquo;t Mountains, it&rsquo;s a Wave. And it&rsquo;s coming right at us!&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Anybody who has seen the film  <u>  <a href=\"http://interstellarfilm.wikia.com/wiki/Miller_%28planet%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Interstellar  </a> </u>  should remember that line.  &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t a Mountains it&rsquo;s a wave!&rdquo;  Apologies, I&rsquo;ve used changed it slightly to fit this blog, but the context is the same.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t seen the film, the &ldquo;two stars&rdquo; land on a planet and they see this beautiful calm sea, stretching out before them.  On the horizon it looks like wonderful mountains, they have a job to do, removing some debris and they can take their time.  It is then they realise (too late), the mountains are actually a wave, so high, it will engulf them.</p><p> I remember watching it and realising it made a great analogy to the parts of the technology industry which are ignoring cloud or hoping it will go way.  Somebody recently said to me &ldquo;Cloud wont happen as the cost of hardware will reduce so much, you won&rsquo;t need to go Cloud&rdquo;.  But like the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; in this film, Cloud / SaaS, is coming and coming fast!</p><p> (Great film if you haven&rsquo;t seen it.)</p><p> This blog, covers what I define as Cloud; (yes, we have seen this all before;) but why this time it&rsquo;s different.</p><p> <strong>  Is the move to Cloud Just Managed Services 2.0? </strong></p><p> Everybody is talking about Cloud right now.  Cloud, some people are saying, is just like going back in time.  You put your thirty year old software in somebody else&rsquo;s data centre and it&rsquo;s cloud, right?  Sounds like what we have being doing for years.  I always called it Managed Services or Outsourcing.  Is this the age of Cloud or are we really in the age of Managed Services 2.0?</p><p> With the arrival of SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) there is also major software change taking place.  People now expect to access their applications on their mobile; Social and the ability to collaborate should be standard (like on Facebook) and people expect report writing should be built in and not some after thought.</p><p> <strong>  What Did We Learn Last Time There was Major Software Disruption? </strong></p><p> Back in the day when we moved from &ldquo;Green Screens&rdquo; to GUI (Graphical User Interfaces), companies took legacy systems and then built a &ldquo;screen scraper&rdquo; GUI on the front end.  Will people be duped again?  If you put Lipstick on a pig, it&rsquo;s still a pig!</p><p> So be careful some people are saying they are Cloud, but it is still the same old, same old.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cost-of-op-vs-saas.png\" width=\"300\"/></p><p> <strong>  Why Are Things Different This Time Round? </strong></p><p> When I post the diagram above on Twitter, it always creates debate.</p><p> The great thing about Cloud, is you no longer have to buy hardware and you no longer have to worry about &ldquo;feed and Watering&rdquo; the systems.  At this point it all sounds like traditional Outsourcing contacts &ndash; just like I say above, Managed Service 2.0.</p><p> <strong>  Cloud &ndash; The Secret Ingredient / &ldquo;Killer App&rdquo; </strong></p><p> BUT Cloud should also offer you upgrades within the cost of the monthly subscription.  This is the &ldquo;Killer App&ldquo;.  Imagine you have an Enterprise grade application such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sap.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SAP  </a> </u>  and still get the system fed and watered (as you did with any Outsourcing contract) but no longer need to pay for upgrades?  The Cloud vendor will take care of the hardware upgrade, operating system upgrade, the database upgrade and the Application upgrade with the subscription charge.</p><p> So while we can argue about the diagram above about the Cost of running On Premise(S) Vs Cloud, if you didn&rsquo;t have to pay for another upgrade again, now that would impact massively on your budget. Right?</p><p> <strong>  Cloud &ndash; This Time The Software Has Moved on Too? </strong></p><p> Business users make decisions about software now, not IT.  They buy software that has been written for the Cloud.  There is also the expectation that (as I mention above) that the applications we use at work, will, look and feel like the applications we use at home.</p><p> This is the change taking place right now!  Applications should no longer look &ldquo;clunky&rdquo; and cost you significant money to upgrade.  This must be a win for companies and end users alike.  You save money, but more importantly the software moves from Transaction Process (TP) to Process Processing (PP).</p><p> Tim Hughes is a speaker and a blogger.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Like it or not, we&rsquo;re all in sales now. </strong></p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re a full-time sales person or a &ldquo;non-sales seller&rdquo;, as Daniel Pink says: &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/01/03/daniel-pink-says-that-in-todays-world-were-all-salespeople/\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   we&rsquo;re all in sales now  </u>  . </a> &rdquo;</p><p> Simultaneously, we are also all getting onto social networks in droves. The problem is, traditional selling methods and tactics don&rsquo;t work well in the new, virtual spaces where we are conducting many of our business relationships.</p><p> Social selling is a set of adaptive behaviors that can help us &ldquo;sell&rdquo; our products and our services &ndash; even ourselves &ndash; in online social networks without coming across as pushy or &ldquo;salesy&rdquo;.</p><p> Here are six ways you can succeed at social selling:</p><p> <strong>  1. Connect with your clients. </strong></p><p> This is the most important group to connect with in social networks precisely because they are already your clients. They have already placed their trust in you and people like recommending who they do business with because it validates their original decision. Plus, if you&rsquo;re not engaging your clients online, who is? Social selling is about deepening client engagement.</p><p> <strong>  2. Connect with your respected peers and centres of influence. </strong></p><p> Most businesses operate in an ecosystem of other businesses and influencers. Aligning yourself with the most highly respected peers in your space increases your visibility and profile. Social selling is about building a community around your business.</p><p> <strong>  3. Connect with high-value prospects. </strong></p><p> You should be connected with every one of your high-value prospects on LinkedIn. You should connect with those that are also on Twitter or other social networks as well. That way, you can get to know them and see what they are interested in and they can be notified when you share something of interest. Social selling is about building relationships first.</p><p> <strong>  4. Share valuable content regularly. </strong></p><p> If you are connected to your high-value relationships in social networks, then sharing great content becomes a way to add value and stay top of mind. Curate and &ldquo;aggressively&rdquo; share great articles on LinkedIn, Twitter and Google+. Tune into the data and take note of what your audiences are interested in reading, clicking and sharing. Social selling is about sharing and adding value.</p><p> <strong>  5. Pay attention to your clients, peers and prospects. </strong></p><p> Social networks facilitate conversations and conversation are always two-sided. You know how great it feels when someone likes, shares or comments on your content? Well, give that feeling to your network. You get as much or more from your network when you pay attention to them as you get from desperately trying to get them to pay attention to you. Social selling is about giving in order to get.</p><p> <strong>  6. Publish your subject matter knowledge widely. </strong></p><p> There are many, many places to share your knowledge and you should be using as many platforms as possible. Publish to your blog. Publish variations on these articles to Linkedin. Do you have a good slide deck? Then, publish it to Slideshare. Your PDF white papers will also work well on Slideshare. Social selling is about sharing what you know in order to help people move through the sales funnel.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Andrew Lisa</p><p> A lot of businesses spent the last several years hanging on for dear life while trying to weather the recession. When a business is in survival mode, it's not looking to expand. But for many, 2015 will be the first year in a long time that they can again prioritize expansion and the search for new clients. Are you a little rusty? Here are some tips for drumming up new business.</p><p> Preparation is the single-most important ingredient to landing new clients.</p><p> <strong>  Be Ready Before You Pick Up the Phone </strong></p><p> As discussed in the article \" <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/blog/whats-getting-in-your-way-of-gaining-commitments\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Who's Getting in Your Way of Gaining Commitments  </a> </u> ,\" plan before you call! The single most destructive element of a sales call gone wrong is a lack of planning. Prepare questions, try to anticipate questions and be prepared with statistics, market research and testimonials to nudge potential customers who are sitting on the fence. Be sure to establish your objectives before you dial, and make sure you have real-life examples about how your product or service is already helping other customers or businesses.</p><p> The same holds true when preparing for a job interview.  Have brief stories in mind of how you previously helped others where you are currently or previously employed.</p><p> <strong>  Follow Through, Follow Up </strong></p><p> Leads don't become sales on their own. It is crucial to walk the fine line between abandoning a promising prospect and being annoying and overbearing. Once you get off the phone with a potential client, you should immediately start thinking about how to get back on the phone with him or her. A good way to stoke a follow-up call is to embed a reason for more contact into the original call. Make a promise to deliver some statistics regarding the potential client's industry, and then follow up with with the information you promised to deliver. You will ensure a second phone call while appearing to be diligent and reliable for delivering what you said you'd deliver.</p><p> <strong>  Do Your Homework </strong></p><p> The single most important thing you can do is research and preparation. Know the potential client's industry, know the trends and, most importantly, know the fears of those in the business. Gain an intimate understanding of what your hopeful client does, how they operate and who they rely on for logistical concerns such as scheduling, supply chain, deliveries and support. Only then can you establish yourself as a credible partner who understands the needs and concerns of the client you're hoping to land.</p><p> <strong>  Get them back on the phone &ndash; always follow up! </strong></p><p> Be prepared. It can't be overstated enough, yet so many cold calls are placed by salespeople whose level or planning is totally frozen. Make sure you've determined what you want from each call, as well as how to get it, before picking up the phone. But be prepared in a general sense, as well. Make sure you've done enough homework on your target client to avoid coming off as amateurish or ill prepared. Finally, always chase the sale &ndash; follow up until the deal is closed!</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/108897242618977470844/posts?rel=author\" target=\"_blank\">   Andrew Lisa  </a> </u>  is a freelance business writer.

Content that just wouldn&rsquo;t fit in so many other communication mediums.

    "link": "why-banks-are-hated-and-what-to-do-about-it",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "I often find headlines around the world that <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/03/the-time-is-ripe-for-disruption-in-banking.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  banks are hated </a></u>, and was reminded of this today when Australian website The Conversation had the headline: <u> <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/why-do-people-hate-bankers-no-really-36342\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why do people hate bankers? No, really&hellip;  </a></u>The website cites research that bankers do not make excess profits and are not overpaid, but are hated due to being big and nasty.  There&rsquo;s more to it than that however.  Banks are disliked as they play an integral role in stifling our ability to enjoy life.  Banks, or rather monetary flows, stifle and oil our ability to relax and enjoy life.Worries over monies are a core challenge for the majority of society who are poor or unable to pay their bills.  This was illustrated by a very sad case just in the last week of a pensioner who committed suicide over an <u> <a href=\"http://money.aol.co.uk/2015/02/04/pensioner-killed-himself-after-receiving-800-bill-for-overpaid/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &pound;800 bill </a></u>.  In other words, it&rsquo;s not banks that are hated but their role of controlling money, wealth and credit.This is a core of banking, and goes back to ancient times.  The moneychangers who Jesus evicts from the temples and the Shylocks with their pound of flesh all emanate this dislike of financiers.  The core of Islamic faith and its rejection of usury is another illustration.  In other words, the use of money and wealth to influence and control is at the heart of faith and civilised life.Money is the root of all evil &hellip; and bankers control it.This is why money and banking is at the core of civilised life, and at the core of our <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2008/05/people-think-mo.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  inherited psychology </a></u>.  It is also why it is one of the most hated professions in the world.  In fact, searching for &lsquo;<u> <a href=\"https://www.google.co.th/search?q=bank+hate&amp;rlz=1C1CHWA_enGB579US579&amp;oq=bank+hate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1894j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  bank hate </a></u>&rsquo; in Google produces some fascinating results, with most of the hits being rants against large American bank brands.It reminds me of the point made by one Australian banker when I first joined this industry, and that was that their brand sucks.  &ldquo;We know our brand sucks&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually one of the least liked brands in Australia and comes just below the brand of cat litter in the rankings of brand recognition in the advertising charts&rdquo;, he went on.  &ldquo;In other wrods, we&rsquo;re less popular than what cats sh*t in&rdquo;, he concluded.He was kind of proud of this fact, and it illuminated me to the knowledge that banks know they are disliked.  Most senior bankers undersantd that their start point is that people hate them.  They know this, as their role is to limit our credit and access to cash.The interesting factor from there is to see that this is an opportunity.  If you know that banks and bank brands are hated, then you know that they will be even more disliked if they do the wrong thing.  If a bank purposefully pushes people into charges thorugh the way they process credits and debits, or if a bank opaquely tries to introduce fees for transactions without transparency, then they know they are going to be disliked even more.This is what I find interesting today.  For example, the story I used for some time about <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2012/08/the-top-five-most-embarrassing-mistakes-by-banks.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Molly Katchpole </a></u>, and her campaign to get Bank of America to withdraw the $5 per month debit card fee is a case in point.  If a bank knows that they start with zero trust and are generally disliked, why make it worse by levying unjustified fees?That is where banks like Metro Bank start.  Metro Bank &ndash; who are our guests at the Financial Services Club dinner on <u> <a href=\"http://fsclub.net/events-focus.cfm?id=438\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  10th March </a></u> &ndash; begin with the headline <u> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7279848/Metro-Bank-well-put-an-end-to-stupid-rules.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  No Stupid Rules </a></u>.What are the Stupid Rules?Probably #1 is to make profits by charging customers for things they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re being charged for (that&rsquo;s why free banking is going to end, as PwC reports <u> <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/02/uk-britain-banks-charges-idUKKBN0L600D20150202\" target=\"_blank\">  this week </a></u>).I could go on, as this premise that banks are naturally hated is one that goes to the core of how to build a differentiated bank.",

    "content": "<p> Should you focus your valuable sales time on getting new customer accounts or developing and investing in current accounts? It's a common question among sales professionals, and the answer is frustrating for some: you have to do both. It's not as simple as a 50/50 split of time and resources. It&rsquo;s really a balance of sales activity based on priority.</p><p> Spend your time wisely when nurturing current customers and expanding your business.</p><p> <strong>  Why It's Important to Focus on Current Accounts </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s tempting to focus on the next customer account and then the next but this approach will leave little time for developing current relationships. Return customers are the foundation of a profitable business, accounting for 25 to 40 percent of total revenues of stable businesses. </p><p> With each subsequent purchase, customers are more likely to come back. Customers who've made their first purchases are only 27 percent more likely to buy again, but for someone who's made three purchases, the odds are at 54 percent for making a fourth purchase. Additionally, marketing to current customers is more cost effective with shorter lead times. The increased interaction helps businesses improve customer service and brand recognition to develop customer loyalty.</p><p> As you invest your time and resources into your current customer base, you begin building loyal brand ambassadors. You'll naturally attract some new customers with this approach as current customers provide referrals through word of mouth marketing. Of course, true to consultative selling, you should look for opportunities to help your customers grow and reach goals whether they have expressed the need or not. That is one of the best ways to build loyalty.</p><p> <strong>  Why New Customer Acquisition is Essential </strong></p><p> Despite the benefits of nurturing established relationships and marketing to existing customers, it&rsquo;s also important to add new business. No matter how talented your sales team is, you will lose some customer accounts. And it's clear from the numbers above that a significant chunk of a business's revenues can be attributed to new customer accounts.</p><p> The problem many salespeople face is that acquiring new customer accounts requires two things they're short on: time and resources. In order to expand and develop your customer base effectively, you will need to prioritize and direct sales activities.</p><p> Plan your sales activities to ensure you're spending your time wisely with prospective customers.</p><p> <strong>  Determining Where to Allocate Your Resources </strong></p><p> In order to spend your time wisely, you need to learn more about current and prospective customers. Customer modeling can help sales teams determine what the ideal customer profile looks like. For example, modeling can help you predict customer behavior, probability of purchase, frequency of purchase, loyalty, spending potential and more. Knowing this information ensures that you get the greatest ROI because you'll be targeting the ideal customers for your business. </p><p> If feasible, you could also consider assigning your maintenance accounts to your inside sales team. This leaves outside sales people free to actively pursue new business.</p><p> Finally, prioritize your sales activities to efficiently allocate your time. This requires establishing sales objectives and making it clear which tasks are most important. It also requires effective time management, which can be enhanced by utilizing pre-call planning techniques and other time savers. </p><p> Developing your relationships with current customer accounts and getting new ones are both important to the success of your business. Customer modeling and prioritization of sales activities can help you balance your time to achieve both goals.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobwillia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bob Williams  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Narrowing down choices for your celebrity endorser should not be based on bias or personal preference; it should be comprehensive and built on sound marketing research </strong></p><p> <strong>  How to Identify Potential Celebrity Candidates </strong></p><p> The celebrity decision should stem from the campaign&rsquo;s creative or big idea. Often times, the reason some marketing campaigns fail is because of a weak connection between the celebrity and product. Picking the right talent for a campaign can be done in three steps:</p><li> <strong>  Creative/Messaging: </strong>  The first step is understanding what role the celebrity will be filling for the campaign.</li><li> <strong>  Ideal Celebrity Candidate: </strong>  Price and availability aside, who is your ideal celebrity for the campaign?</li><li> <strong>  Establishing Criteria: </strong>  Who does your target audience relate to? This could encompass a variety of people from television characters to politicians. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The Process of Elimination </strong></p><p> There are a number of different metrics that marketers can use to narrow down their list of potential celebrities. Using all of these methods is rarely feasible for most budgets, so marketers should pick and choose which will be most effective for their current needs. These methods include:</p><li> <strong>  Qualitative:  </strong> Third parties, focus groups, individual interviews, etc. have the ability to yield powerful information regarding a celebrity&rsquo;s brand equity and any connotations associated with them.</li><li> <strong>  Quantitative:  </strong> Box office sales, Nielsen ratings, E-Poll, Q-Scores, Billboard Charts, etc. can all be used as a way to compare numbers attached to celebrities.</li><li> <strong>  Schedule:  </strong> Research the celebrities in question and mark off those who will be working during your planned production, or have conflicting events of any sort. Athletes can be especially difficult to reserve with their constant training and demanding schedules.</li><li> <strong>  Conflicts in the Category: </strong>  Ensure that the celebrity does not have an existing or recent partnership with a competitive product. This may include factors like whether or not the celebrity has ever publicly mentioned competitive products in a positive manner.</li><li> <strong>  Other Variables:  </strong> Usually, problems with celebrity marketing deals aren&rsquo;t with the celebrities themselves, but with their teams. Agents, managers, labels, publicists, and attorneys can be problematic, and in some cases make it difficult to secure the celebrity. If the celebrity themselves won&rsquo;t endorse the product, it may be because they don&rsquo;t want to use their image in advertising, find the brand controversial, or aren&rsquo;t interested in being a spokesperson. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Choosing the Right Celebrity Performer </strong></p><p> The final questions that should be asked during the decision process may be the most important. These questions are:</p><li> <strong>  Are they believable?  </strong> Do they appear as an honest brand ambassador, or do they look desperate for publicity?</li><li> <strong>  Are they overexposed? </strong>  How many projects are they currently involved in, or how many products are they endorsing? If a celebrity is associated with too many things, they may not be memorable candidates. A celebrity that isn&rsquo;t over overused will have more notability with the audience.</li><li> <strong>  Will they achieve key objectives? </strong>  Looking at the success of the celebrity&rsquo;s earlier work, especially in advertising, can be helpful. Do they have the power to move product? Is their word respected enough to influence purchasing behavior?</li><li> <strong>  Will their &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; overshadow the brand?  </strong> Just like some advertisements suffer from being too funny or too moving, some can suffer from a celebrity being too famous. For example, viewers may remember a commercial featuring Brad Pitt, but they may not remember the product or brand he/she is promoting.</li><p>  </p>",

Sorry, but it happens every day.</p><p> <strong>  Want more money? Damn skippy. </strong></p><p> We tend to take our foot off the gas pedal when we are working and life is good. We stop updating the resume and LinkedIn profiles. We get out of touch with what&rsquo;s trending in the world. We allow our skills to atrophy. We think that our job needs us more than we need our jobs &ndash; because there is no way they could function without us, right?</p><p> We buy new homes, cars, clothes and jewelry as if things will never ever change. We get a little cocky.</p><p> If that&rsquo;s not your story then this is &ndash; you worked someplace for a long time and &ldquo;Booyah!&rdquo; they announced a reduction in workforce aka layoffs. Now you are forced to rethink your career and try to get a new job among all that competition in the job market today.</p><p> <strong>  Or maybe you are just tired and want to do something new. </strong></p><p> Whatever the case, the job market has changed in the last 5 years. Now you have the rise in social recruiting to contend with and increased competition from new graduates &ndash; because of the recession people really did go back to school to gain an advantage. This means that now more than ever there are a lot more people going after the same jobs.</p><p> If you are re-entering the job search it&rsquo;s important to know the resume is not dead at all; you definitely need one &ndash; an updated visually attractive resume that will get you noticed. That&rsquo;s going to be your biggest weapon and ally in finding gainful employment.</p><p> You also need help with your social media persona because now over 80% of all employers look for you on social media and if you aren&rsquo;t searchable, they become suspicious. 95% of all employers and recruiters use LinkedIn to verify resumes. So you should get on LinkedIn.</p><p> Recently, I did some crowdsourcing &ndash; crowdsourcing is when you ask the &ldquo;crowd&rdquo; that you are connected to &ndash; in this case I asked my Facebook and Twitter connections (mostly HR and recruiters) this question. &ldquo;What percentage of resumes would you say are bad?&rdquo; and the response was &ldquo;65 to 95%&rdquo; (the lowest was 65 and the highest 95).I believe those numbers because most of the ones I get are bad and all of them can be improved.</p><p> I look at it like your mobile phone &ndash; each year a new phone comes out which is better than the previous version. Your resume is the same way it needs to be update annually.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s a free tip: If you wrote your resume yourself, it&rsquo;s probably bad. </strong></p><p> Networking is key to finding a new job but if your resume is subpar then you find that your friends will have a hard time recommending you because of your poor resume - it looks bad on them too. So get it your credentials together.</p><p> The game has changed and it&rsquo;s gone social now &ndash; <strong>  so are you ready for the new age in social recruitment? </strong></p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Numbers don&rsquo;t lie. <strong>  On the other hand, we often lie to ourselves when we don&rsquo;t know the numbers. </strong> Gut decisions are good, but if we can access the numbers to help us make better decisions, the numbers are invaluable.  <br/> <br/> What numbers am I talking about? Results-based numbers including the following: <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Future Sales:  </strong> A number, presented monthly, of new prospects, hot prospects, potential sales, future clients in your pipeline, number of new clients, and sources. These can help us by measuring ourselves through looking back and looking forward, determining trends, and making decisions about marketing strategies and sales skills. Without them, we are guessing and assuming.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Referrals:  </strong> The number of referrals from clients, prospects, strategic alliances, etc. are invaluable to track. These numbers, viewed and discussed monthly, can help determine trends up or down, and help to identify areas of focus if the numbers are of concern. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Website Analytics: </strong>  Website analytics are critical. Accessing the data on how many people are coming to your website, when, what pages they visit, how long they are staying, where they came from, what the bounce rate is, etc. These are critical numbers to look at, probably weekly, to see if there are trends or problems. Problems could be that visitors are &ldquo;bouncing&rdquo; off your website before going anywhere but your home page. That is a bad sign for the compelling nature of your home page and probably needs to be changed. You probably already have analytics set up on your website and if not, you can set it up for free at www.google.com/analytics. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Social Media Analytics:  </strong> For professional purposes, we usually don&rsquo;t spend time on social media reaching out to clients, prospects, and strategic alliances for fun. We are doing it for business. So, compare the number of followers, interactions, connections, how many people are actually engaging with your social media sites, and the views on the content you post. If nothing is going on (which can be the case) then stop wasting the time to use social media OR try new things and see if your results change. Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter have analytics as well as programs like Hootsuite.com. <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Marketing Events:  </strong> The best numbers to track from a seminar or event you host are not just the number of people that came to the dinner or the number of sales closed. It is of course those numbers along with the number of appointments scheduled, appointments held, and the amount of the sales. These numbers need to coordinate with the amount of money spent on invitations, mailing lists, dinner, and handouts, as well as the time spent by staff on managing the event, following up, and the cost of materials printed. This is the only way to measure real seminar success and it points us directly to areas of improvement. <br/> <br/> If you aren&rsquo;t already looking at your business analytics, now is a great time to take a few moments and put in place some systems to measure your numbers. And if you already have the numbers at your access, now is a great time to start looking at them consistently. I know it helps to make smarter decisions, and who doesn&rsquo;t need a few more of those.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As a Financial Advisor and a steward of your firm&rsquo;s future, you may be contemplating changing firms and moving your business because it&rsquo;s in the best interest of all relevant stakeholders.  And while porting a business from firm to firm has become more efficient as the ecosystem has evolved to be more attuned to advisors in motion, it still requires significant planning, organization and effort.  As important, it&rsquo;s not a flip-the-switch kind of process so you must be prepared to exercise patience while in flux. </p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t let this interruption deter you.  A thoughtful, well-calculated transition will likely yield benefits that endure for years! </strong></p><p> Having facilitated numerous transitions, here are 10 Tips to procuring the highest level of success with the greatest amount of manageability, efficiency and dare I say, sanity: </p><p> To keep your attention, we&rsquo;ll start with the first 5 Tips and post Tips 6-10 next week!</p><p> <strong>  1. Engage Legal / Compliance FIRST </strong></p><p> Hire a professional early in the investigative stage and have all contracts reviewed.  This includes but is not limited to:  Employment or Independent Contractor Agreement; Non-Compete, Non-Solicit, Compensation, Partnership, and Client Investment Advisory agreements; Equity and Incentive Plans and your firm&rsquo;s Privacy Policy.  It&rsquo;s imperative you understand terms, conditions, risks, potential consequences associated with those risks and how to best manage the overall process.  The discovery becomes the blueprint for your eventual plan of execution.  You won&rsquo;t be sorry.</p><p> <strong>  2. Analyze Your Business </strong></p><p> Know your key business metrics:   AUM, gross revenue, expenses, income, profitability, timing of payments, etc.  A transition can potentially affect any of those components and you need to understand the ramifications.</p><p> Analyze your Client Base:  Identify the number of Households and Accounts, AUM and Revenue per Client, average account size.  Review each relationship and assign a probability of them joining you at your new firm.  As important, earmark clients you don&rsquo;t want to follow you!  Doing the upfront work provides an informed estimate of what your business will look like in the neat-term future.  Your new contra firm and/or custodian will likely require this information as well.  *Do NOT share any non-public client information prematurely, unnecessarily or without the right to do so.</p><p> Evaluate Asset Mix, Trading &amp; Investment Vehicles:  Be able to describe the breakdown of your asset base across the major asset classes &ndash; equities, fixed income, cash, alternatives and type of investment vehicles.  Know your historical trading data and highlight if your next 12 months could be significantly different and why.  Run a comprehensive list of securities held in your clients&rsquo; portfolios to determine in advance if the same investments are available at the new contra firm.  Be certain to understand availability, fees, minimums, share class restrictions, etc., of like vehicles at the contra firm.  This especially applies to mutual funds, separately managed accounts and alternative investments.</p><p> Compare Economics:  This applies to Yours and the Clients&rsquo;.  For advisor economics, be sure to assess Gross Revenues, Expenses, Net revenues, Operating Margin, Bonus (if applicable), Deferred Comp, Benefits, Loans, Growth potential, intangible value for built-in services.  Also, in most cases, you should assume a lag in revenues due to the transfer of clients and assets, usually for one to two quarters.  Finally, evaluate Client economics, including client fees, trading costs, account level fees, possible close-out fees, and pricing for comparable products and services.</p><p> <strong>  3. Compare Product &amp; Services </strong></p><p> Beyond investments, identify other products &amp; services that you may depend upon and/or your clients expect.  These may include banking and lending, bill pay services, trust services, margin, specific technology or trading capabilities, marketing and practice management consulting services, etc.  You&rsquo;ll need to know that a similar if not broader menu of services is waiting for you at the contra firm.</p><p> <strong>  4. Assemble a Transition Team </strong>  </p><p> Assign an internal team lead.  If you&rsquo;re solo, well then you&rsquo;re it.  If part of a larger unit where you are a principal, I suggest designating someone else as Lead.  You&rsquo;ll have plenty of other primary tasks to handle.  Your Transition Team lead should identify a point person at the contra firm as well.  They can assemble other role players as needed.  They should also deliver progress reports, seek decisions from you, and solicit input as appropriate.  Ultimately, you are accountable so don&rsquo;t become too far removed from the process.  Regular communication will minimize surprises and maximize your contribution to the process.</p><p> <strong>  5. Develop a Coordinated Transition Plan </strong></p><p> To prioritize objectives and action items, as well as ensure synchronization, develop a plan that represents all key stakeholders.  Include your transition team, the new contra firm and/or custodian, and any associated consultants, vendors, etc.  Solicit deliverables and timetables from each party; determine points of accountability, roles, responsibilities and tasks of everyone involved; be sure to include timelines and success metrics!</p><p> An essential key to successfully executing on a transition is regularly scheduled communication.  Everything suggested above should be reported in a consistent, transparent, accessible manner.  I recommend maintaining reports that are posted on a shared but protected drive (Google Drive or Dropbox for example) on a regular basis.  To supplement, schedule standing calls/meetings to keep the process moving smoothly.  Plan each meeting and distribute agenda items with ample notice to attendees.  Maximize your time. </p>",

    "content": "For those of you just tuning in, nine months ago, I quit my <u> <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/5-reasons-quit-day-job-pursue-dream/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  executive job to pursue my dream </a></u>. Nope, no big buy-out, just me feeling the pull of a calling and taking the leap. &ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo; was my most frequently heard phrase at that time. It&rsquo;s been nine months to birth this business.<p> Although I&rsquo;m certainly not an expert on building a start-up, I&rsquo;m confident enough in the momentum that I wanted to share my lessons learned, in the hopes of saving others some time.</p><p> <strong>  10 LESSONS FOR SUCCEEDING AS AN ENTREPRENEUR </strong></p><li> <strong>  Differentiate your brand </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s tempting to be all things to all people, but that just makes you look like everyone else. It&rsquo;s been an evolution, but I&rsquo;m finding it vital to define and differentiate my brand and to share it consistently wherever I show up.</li><li> <strong>  Be scrappy, then patient </strong> <br/> There&rsquo;s no doubt this year has been a constant hustle. I&rsquo;ve worked most days, including the weekends. I&rsquo;ve gotten up early and worked like a machine. I&rsquo;ve spoken to and written for anyone who asked. And for the first six months, I wondered if ANY of the bulbs I&rsquo;d been planting would sprout. And then, just about six months to the day, work started coming in. I don&rsquo;t regret the scrappy, but I do regret the angst. If you&rsquo;re doing the right thing, be patient with yourself, this stuff takes time.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t underestimate your value </strong> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/12/where-to-start.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Seth Godin&rsquo;  </a> </u> s recent advice pretty much sums up my first six months.&rdquo;Begin with the smallest possible project in which someone will pay you money to solve a problem they know they have. Charge less than it&rsquo;s worth and more than it costs you. Repeat.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s a great way to start and I have no regrets. BUT, I soon learned I was really undervaluing my work. Have the confidence to charge what you&rsquo;re worth.</li><li> <strong>  Work comes from unusual places </strong> <br/> The strength of loose ties is so true. Wonderful people from my business past are popping up in companies all over the country. The friend of a friend thing is working well too. Always operate with high integrity and confident humility, you never know who is paying attention.</li><li> <strong>  Being nice is a great business strategy </strong> <br/> Call it karma or luck, but two of my favorite projects came from just reaching out to someone to check in as a caring human being when they needed support. I&rsquo;m pretty sure nice has trumped any marketing strategy I&rsquo;ve tried so far.</li><li> <strong>  Always provide more than expected </strong> <br/> The old adage, &ldquo;under promise, over deliver&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t quite sum it up. I see it more as &ldquo;carefully design what will best meet their needs, and then think of a bonus topper.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Competitors&rdquo; make amazing strategic partners </strong> <br/> I love working with other leadership folks with the same mission and the same journey. It&rsquo;s the best way to learn, grow, and collaborate.</li><li> <strong>  Some people are just selfish, recognize the signs </strong> <br/> I had a few disappointing false starts in terms of  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/7-reasons-collaboration-breaks-down/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   collaborators  </u>  . </a>  I&rsquo;ve learned to ask more questions and to talk about the tough stuff like money, sooner in the game.</li><li> <strong>  Diversify your strategy </strong> <br/> As I was getting started, it was tough to expect too much momentum from any one channel. But I found that investing in building some speaking, some consulting, some coaching, some writing and some teaching created a nice integrated approach, as well as supported my long-term vision of making a broader impact on the world. I don&rsquo;t think my business would have been profitable as quickly if I had just picked one arena.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t neglect your health </strong> <br/> Start-ups can take a toll. The first six months I ate too much and exercised to little- a terrible formula. I&rsquo;ve now gotten a grip and realized that being a healthy role model is all part of the brand. I&rsquo;m also finding I&rsquo;m more productive returning to my healthier lifestyle again. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s not been easy, but I&rsquo;ve never looked back. Thank you all for being an amazing part of this journey and of the path forward.</p>",

    "title": "How Sia Can Teach You to Be a Better Leader",
    "link": "how-sia-can-teach-you-to-be-a-better-leader",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Starting off in a career, many people have aspirations to move up the ranks &ndash; manager, director, VP, CEO, owner. How one goes about acquiring these roles makes all the difference with regard to the leader and leadership you become known for &ndash; essentially your brand in the business world.</p><p> My friend and Performance I Create colleague,  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/czarinaofhr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Janine Truitt  </a> </u> , published an article last week entitled  <u>  <a href=\"/workforce/leadership-karma\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leadership Karma  </a> </u> . Janine discusses hers and her past colleagues&rsquo; dealings with immature, power-hungry, assholes and the unfortunate path many leaders take when gaining power to begin making decisions and drive influence. In the case of Janine&rsquo;s, the many people she references have met their demise and the house of cards came tumbling down, with their nasty, demoralizing leadership eventually removing them from their throne.</p><p> What Janine speaks of is more of the truth in today&rsquo;s everyday organization regardless of office bookshelves lined with the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; takes on leadership theories. To put it bluntly, many leadership tactics haven&rsquo;t updated themselves from the 80s, where intimidation, fear, and do what I say because I am the manager rained king. And can we expect any different when many organizations have a more &ldquo;tenured&rdquo; workforce leading them and this is what they grew up with?</p><p> While the answer to that question from most people in HR would be yes, can we say others within the organization would also answer the same way? I feel if you asked many leaders &ldquo;off the record&rdquo; this question, the answer would be no. My belief is derived from seeing too many leaders getting caught up with assimilating career progression on being known and seen versus allowing their leadership and results from that leadership making them known (know I am not speaking of the beat people up or yelling leadership to get results). Good leaders are recognized by developing and coaching their teams to get impactful results and not stepping up to be the one taking credit.</p><p> This philosophy I recognized recently with an  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4DMk9BJyY4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   interview I watched between Chris Connelly and Sia  </a> </u> . If you are not familiar with who Sia is, she is a singer and songwriter who has shaken up the Top 40 world with her talents. Her most recent singles,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vjPBrBU-TM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chandelier  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWZGAExj-es\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Elastic Heart  </a> </u> , have rocked the airwaves. But there is a funny thing with this singer, she has no desire to show her face when performing or conducting interviews with media. The interview she did with Chris Connelly was with her back faced to him; the same can be seen with performances on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaBlYm9-b20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ellen  </a> </u> ,  <u>  Jimmy Kimmel </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hg_rIqOZHc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SNL  </a> </u> .</p><p> Now, I have talked with several friends about Sia and many have told me she is crazy for using the antic of not showing her face when performing. However, I am not in the same camp. Listening to her interview she conducted with Chris Connelly, she explains she doesn&rsquo;t want to be famous. Yes, many of us know what she looks like, but with her recent work her face hasn&rsquo;t been the focus. Instead, it is music she wants us to know her for. Not the big hair, how big or little she is, what jewelry or clothes she has on, etc.</p><p> This is the same concept many leaders need to evaluate and take practice.</p><p> If you want to be famous, then continue to be the conniving, cold-hearted, leader and eventually you will be taken down just as Janine spoke about. However, if you want to progress your career through effective leadership which people respect, I suggest taking some of these thoughts into consideration:</p><li> <strong>  Provide opportunities to conduct true self-reflection. </strong>  Does your leadership style portray who you really or or what you want to achieve? If you are not sure about perceptions or feedback on what your are doing or how you are leading, sit back to understand why you don&rsquo;t know. If needed, solicit &ldquo;true&rdquo; feedback from colleagues, peers, and employees with an open ear &ndash; don&rsquo;t get defensive or deny, but rather acknowledge, reflect, and set out a plan to be and do different.</li><li> <strong>  Give to your employees. </strong> Employees all want to continue their development. Understand how you can give to your employees &ndash; knowledge, experience, project work, advice, etc. And when they perform, recognize that performance. Remember the old adage, it is better to give than receive. But keep in mind giving doesn&rsquo;t mean beating them up.</li><li> <strong>  Challenge the norm. </strong>  Challenging the norm can be difficult; especially if you are in an organization where no one wants to do things differently. But know how and where to build allies to create a movement (professionally). Challenging the norm can help create quality, unique outcomes that build everyone in the organization up versus just creating tons of untimely, fall flat initiatives.</li><li> <strong>  Know when to take a step back. </strong>  Many times when an opportunity presents itself, we immediately jump on it. I get it, we have seen and lived too much where we didn&rsquo;t take an opportunity and then we spend endless amounts of time reflecting on the &ldquo;what if&rdquo;. But have you ever sat back and thought, would it be different or would I be happier if I hadn&rsquo;t made this move? While I understand decisions have to be made quickly in today&rsquo;s fast-paced world. reflection should always take priority. Don&rsquo;t put yourself in a situation to fail, be miserable, or change who you are to win the game&hellip;.this is where it might be wise to take the step back.</li><li> <strong>  Seek out a mentor.  </strong> Mentors can help keep us grounded and face reality directly. They provide a different viewpoint we may not be able or want to see.</li>",

How many different folders are your documents, photos, and data in? Are the files easy to find and access? Is your important data backed up?</p><p> <strong>  Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to clean out that hard drive. </strong></p><p> One of the downsides of the relatively low cost of  <u>  <a href=\"http://ecopreneurist.com/2012/06/22/the-paperless-office-will-it-ever-really-happen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   digital storage  </a> </u>  is that while we can now save just about every file we want without worrying about running out of space, we can also end up with a whole lot of stuff on our hard drives that we don&rsquo;t need to keep, which can make it difficult to find the important stuff, especially if we&rsquo;re not very consistent at organizing all of those files.</p><p> And even if we know we ought to be more organized with our files, and we even try to be, the thought of going through them all and  <u>  <a href=\"http://craftingagreenworld.com/tag/organizing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   organizing  </a> </u>  and backing them all up is quite daunting.</p><p> To help make the project of cleaning your entire hard drive(s) a bit easier, the folks over at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.singlehop.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SingleHop  </a> </u> , a cloud computing company, have put together a 3-week Clean Computer Calendar, which breaks the process down into more manageable bits.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"607\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SingleHop_Calendar-1024x607.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></p><p> I must confess that I only recently thought about cleaning out any of the old files from my desktop, and only because I happened to notice how little storage space I had left on the hard drive. A quick glance through some of the bigger folders on my drive revealed that not only do I have photos in at least 3 different locations, but I also have two separate music library locations, as well as a good number of applications that I never use anymore. And while I do have two external hard drives, only one of them is for a backup, which I just realized doesn&rsquo;t include backing up the first drive, so I clearly have some work to do on my machines.

    "content": "<p> Written by: Sue Bergin for <u>  <a href=\"http://emoneyadvisor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eMoney Advisor  </a> </u></p><p> With 12,000 to 16,000 financial advisors retiring each year for the next decade, there is a race to recruit the next generation of stewards of our nation&rsquo;s wealth. In order to keep up with America&rsquo;s demand for financial advice, the financial service industry must add over 200,000 new advisors in order to make up for the retiring generation. Just like in any other field, the race to acquire young, up-and-coming talent is on.</p><p> <strong>  Getting them in the door </strong></p><p> This demand for young talent has prompted many firms to rethink the way they attract, hire, and retain young professionals. Some firms have dusted off their old college recruiting strategies, while others are taking new approaches, like using social networking sites like LinkedIn or even checking other sites like the 21st century want-ad site, Craigslist.</p><p> While sourcing candidates will get bodies to the door, an extra effort must be made to get them in the door. But that&rsquo;s not all&mdash;you must keep these new advisors engaged enough to learn the business and develop the skills they need. This won&rsquo;t only ensure the success of their careers, but the success of your business as well.</p><p> <strong>  Creating a culture </strong></p><p> In order to successfully attract and retain young recruits, you must create a culture that embraces the positive attributes they have to offer&mdash;even if some of them seem a bit out of the ordinary. You must allow for autonomy and flexibility, and foster their ability to collaborate. You may have to view things like gaming and trolling social media sites not as a waste of time, but a creative necessity.</p><p> There is no doubt that the next wave of advisors will befuddle their predecessors. That&rsquo;s a small price to pay for the potential they possess to solve some of the age-old problems that have plagued the industry. They are wired to innovate, to find a better way, question the first answer given, and demand transparency. They are social beings that collaborate in virtually every aspect of their lives, whether it is for input on what to make for dinner or creating a comprehensive financial plan. It&rsquo;s this backgrounds that lead many to have large professional networks at the beginnings of their careers that would be the envy of even the most seasoned of veterans. And, they know how to work those networks in ways that we can&rsquo;t fathom.</p><p> For those trying to cultivate the next generation advisors, know that you will be successful if you can fan their passion for helping others while being open to new ways of doing so.</p>",

    "title": "Failing Insurance Policies - What Causes This?",
    "link": "failing-insurance-policies-what-causes-this",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When someone buys a life insurance policy, the amount owed in premiums is determined based on a combination of several factors. The most significant considerations include:</p><li> <strong>  Policyholder&rsquo;s age, gender and health </strong></li><li> <strong>  The type of product being purchased </strong></li><li> <strong>  The assumed economic growth of the policy over time </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Problems arise when people do not pay the premium amounts initially planned. It is important that policyholders stay true to the planned premium, especially in the beginning years, to ensure their policy&rsquo;s continued solvency. If the premiums are not being paid, a policy can become underfunded, and will not benefit the insured as it was intended to at the time of purchase.</p><p> The 3 most common types of plans and the problems that can result if premiums are not paid into them regularly:  </p><li> <p>  <strong>   Variable universal life policies that were drafted years ago:   </strong>  Many of these were written in the 1980s and 90s. Because of prosperous economic times during those years, very optimistic assumptions regarding the market and interest rates were made, and unfortunately many of these factors have not panned out nearly as well as expected. Policyholders had been told for years that they did not need to make monthly premium payments because they were in such good shape that the premiums could be automatically deducted from the policy's cash value, and the market performance would maintain their values &ndash; or even provide growth. So every year, premiums (plus internal fees) have been deducted from the cash value of the policy, without any new premium being added. Add this deficit to the financial crisis in 2008 and you can see why these policies are now at risk of failing. </p></li><p> Ironically, we have found that flat market years have a worse outcome for these types of policies than down markets. With down markets, there is typically a rebound of an upmarket to help recapture losses. In a flat market, the same may not be true. All the while, the cost of insurance and expenses keep being taken out.</p><p> One of the most unfortunate issues with these older policies is that many of them are owned by senior citizens, now in their 70s or 80s. It is much more difficult for them to get new insurance if their older policies should fail since their health and age may make it cost prohibitive.</p><li> <p>  <strong>   Guaranteed universal life policies:   </strong>  These have been very popular over the last 5 to 8 years. People wanted death benefits that were guaranteed, without having to worry about external matters such as market fluctuation. The problem is that the guarantees are dependent upon premiums being paid on time and as planned. A lot of people did not realize that if they missed a premium, they may not receive any notice that their policy guarantees had been compromised. The insurance companies just took the premium amount owed out of the policy&rsquo;s cash value to maintain its solvency. </p></li><p> If a policyholder with one of these types of plans has missed premiums, he or she may still be able to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; with the payments and restore the guarantees in their policy. The longer they wait, however, the more expensive it will be to accomplish this.</p><li> <p>  <strong>   Whole life insurance policies:  </strong>   Premium issues with these often surprise people because they think that whole life policies are not &ldquo;flexible premium&rdquo; products, meaning that you have to pay your premium or the policy lapses. This can be true, but many of these policies have a built in APL (Automatic Premium Loan) which means that if a policyholder fails to pay the minimum premium within 60 days from the due date, the premium will automatically be deducted from the cash value of the policy, in the form of a loan. Of course, this loan accumulates interest, eating into the policy&rsquo;s cash value and death benefit if not promptly paid off. And in fact, some people don't even realize that they're even taking these Automatic Premium Loans, even though it has been happening for multiple years in a row. Fast forward 10 years down the road, and they suddenly discover that their policies are underwater. </p></li><p> <strong>  Takeaway: Advisors should be telling their clients, pay your premiums on time, every time.  </strong> And at least once every 3 years, clients should consult with you to make sure their plans are still meeting the financial expectations in place at the time they were purchased. Providing your clients with insurance reviews that include in-force illustrations to explain exactly how their policies are expected to perform is another great way to show them that you're taking good care of them and their finances.</p>",

    "content": "<p> So, you&rsquo;ve committed to writing a blog or a newsletter and things have been going well. <strong>  Then one day you feel like you&rsquo;ve run out of ideas. </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;ve contracted a case of writer&rsquo;s block and the symptoms are unmistakable: a blank page, the urge to do something &ndash; anything &ndash; else, insecurity.</p><p> Have no fear. Writer&rsquo;s block is no big deal if you&rsquo;ve got the right prescription, and here are three things that you can do immediately:</p><p> <strong>  Check in with your Twitter feed </strong></p><p> This is highly counterintuitive because social media is rarely mentioned as a way to be moreproductive. But there are a millions of writing ideas dropping through your Twitter feed right now. Reach out and grab one.</p><p> There are ways to refine what you&rsquo;re looking at on Twitter. First, create a locked list of your competitors. If you haven&rsquo;t created one yet, make one today and see what they are writing about. Now build off or critique the ideas regarding something they&rsquo;ve shared.</p><p> Second, turn to specific people who have great ideas and see what they&rsquo;ve done recently. Now write your take on an idea of theirs.</p><p> <strong>  Carry your idea journal </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re going to be a reliable source of content, an idea journal stores your ideas before you forget them. After work today, go out and buy a notebook. It can be a stylish Moleskin or a tried-and-true Hilroy. Just make sure it has space to write down your ideas when they pop into your head, no matter how odd they may seem at the time.</p><p> We get our best ideas when we&rsquo;re nowhere near a computer. We got the idea for this post while walking to a client meeting.</p><p> <strong>  Seek the opinion of your clients </strong></p><p> Asking your clients for topics they&rsquo;d like you to cover acts as a good touch point, plus their feedback will hopefully provide many ideas for future posts.</p><p> There are a few ways you can ask: face to face or by personal email, SurveyMonkey, blog post or social networks like Twitter and LinkedIn. Pick one or two and see if it works for you.</p><p> We&rsquo;ll be writing more about advisor communications in the coming months. Until then, give these three strategies a try &ndash; they may be the cure for writer&rsquo;s block that you&rsquo;ve been seeking.</p>",

    "link": "finserv-hosting-an-event-then-be-extraordinary",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Events are a common part of most companies&rsquo; marketing and communications mix, but how often can any of us say that an event we planned or attended was anything more than ordinary? Sure, it may have been good, maybe even great. But did the event surprise and delight the people attending? If you&rsquo;re one of the fortunate few who has hosted or attended a killer event, good for you. Now tell me&hellip; how exactly did the firm hosting the event benefit?</p><p> Right off the bat, events are expensive. Whether you&rsquo;re paying for transportation and lodging or just presentations, some meals and a few social or networking gatherings, you will be spending a lot of money. You need to know how that investment has performed. With careful planning and a deliberate focus on your audience, you can establish benchmarks for success that justify the expense and set the stage for consistently superior performance.</p><p> There are a lot of good reasons for hosting events&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Internal events for employees only: </strong></p><li> Good news about acquisitions, business results</li><li> Bad news of any kind affecting multiple employees</li><li> Company Honors/ Employee recognition</li><li> Seasonal/holidays</li><li> Policy change announcements</li><li> Leadership changes <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  External events &ndash; for clients, prospects, friends &amp; neighbors: </strong></p><li> Introduce new leaders or client facing associates</li><li> Introduce and educate about new products or services</li><li> Entertain and engage (should always apply to the above)</li><li> Attract referrals</li><li> Thank vendors and friends</li><li> Build community and share best practices with fellow professionals, centers of influence and friendly competitors <br/>  </li><p> All of these occasions present the event planner with an opportunity to build affinity and engagement with the event&rsquo;s guests. If the attendee is an employee, success can be measured by employee retention, recruitment referral rates and their willingness to act as an ambassador for the firm. If a client or a prospect; then in assets gained, accounts opened, referrals and (again) ambassadorship. Here are five tips for making your event all it ought to be&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Honor the brand </strong> <br/> If a senior exec will not be actively engaged in planning the event, use or hire an experienced event planner with a personal style that reflects the company&rsquo;s brand and sensibility. Even if you have decided on an event that will be a little out of the box, the person who is making choices and directing providers will need to see the world the same way your company and its leaders do.</p><p> <strong>  Really know your audience </strong> <br/> Depending on your guests&rsquo; relationship with the firm, understand why they are there. Put yourself in their shoes and talk about ways to provide an experience that they might choose for themselves, whether it&rsquo;s entertainment, education (a wine tasting or cooking class), or has a decidedly corporate agenda, look for ways to make your audience happier or smarter.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t assume expensive means excellent </strong> <br/> In season one of NetFlix&rsquo; excellent House of Cards, a formal fundraising dinner hosted by Claire (protagonist Frank&rsquo;s wife) is unexpectedly displaced, pushing the elite audience of Washington dignitaries to an outdoor venue with last-minute catering provided by Frank&rsquo;s favorite barbecue rib joint. The event is a smash. Of course, surprise was the key in this scenario. Whenever you can, look for ways to surprise your guests and don&rsquo;t assume another expensive meal and open bar will do the trick.</p><p> <strong>  Make your event providers your partners </strong> <br/> Throughout my career, I have gone out of my way to know and connect with the people who will be bringing my event to life. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how meticulously I have planned if the execution is flawed. Get to know the names and responsibilities of everyone who will affect your guests&rsquo; experience. Make sure they know you and give them the information they will need so you&rsquo;re all in it together to knock your guests&rsquo; socks off.</p><p> <strong>  Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse </strong> <br/> Understanding that you have set expectations for the event (new assets, better employee engagement) all the event&rsquo;s programming and presentations need to serve that objective. I recommend establishing a theme for the event that leadership and speakers understand and embrace. They should then organize their comments and visuals around that theme and make sure all presentations are polished and transitions are seamless. At this stage, you&rsquo;ll be glad your &ldquo;partners&rdquo;, the Audio-Visual technicians, are standing by to make sure technology is not the problem it often seems to be.</p><p> Follow these tips and your next event will be the best you have ever hosted. More importantly, you&rsquo;ll have more than anecdotal information to help measure the effectiveness of the event. With this in hand, you can confidently commence with the process of making each subsequent event better than the last.</p> ",

    "content": "<p> FBI Firearms instructors train new agents to shoot correctly. This means sight alignment, trigger control, and breath control. Focus on the sights, not the target. The target should be blurry.</p><p> Four times a year agents re-qualify with their weapon on the range. The only time I handled my gun was at firearms training because I worked counterintelligence&mdash;we don&rsquo;t usually shoot foreign spies!</p><p> I was not feeling confident as I joined a mock arrest team with raised paint guns. I went through the back door and into the kitchen. Right, clear. Left, clear. Overhead, clear. </p><p> Firearms instructors were hiding out in the abandoned house. To be shot with a paint gun was better than the real thing, but still, I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable.</p><p> That feeling got worse when a paint gun fired as I went through a doorway. I looked at a team member, a guy from the Organized Crime squad. We were better shots than the instructor so he went down with Pepto Bismo pink splattered on his chest.</p><p> I&rsquo;m pretty sure it came from my colleague&rsquo;s gun. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get back to the safety of my office in the city.</p><p> Like many others, I preferred to stick to a comfortable environment because 1) it was familiar, and 2) I was at my best at what I did. At that time, reaching the top meant investigating the activities of foreign intelligence officers, and as a goal-oriented person, there was great feeling of accomplishment.</p><p> The problem with reaching our goal by making it to the top is that we don&rsquo;t go to the next level.</p><p> Why? Because going to the next level means we&rsquo;ll be starting at the bottom again. It&rsquo;s uncomfortable&mdash;we&rsquo;re out of our comfort zone and we&rsquo;ll have to work harder to be the best.</p><p> But to get something you&rsquo;ve never had, you must do something you&rsquo;ve never done. </p><p> Here are 5 ways a strong mind can boost your confidence:</p><p> <strong>  1. Strong Minds Don&rsquo;t Neglect The Amazing People Around Them </strong></p><p> They are motivated by people who are smarter, brighter, and more experienced. </p><p> Strong minds know these are the people who will give them a reason to push themselves harder.</p><p> Ultimately, they will also be better.</p><p> Look for opportunities to be surrounded by people who are performing at the next level. This is the environment in which you will grow and learn. You will challenge yourself and emerge stronger and more confident in your abilities.</p><p> <strong>  2. Strong Minds Don&rsquo;t Need To Always Be Right </strong></p><p> They are willing to do things that they are not quite prepared to do.</p><p> They know that is how they grow&mdash;not playing it safe until they are 100% sure they will be a success. When they&rsquo;re not sure they can do something, and they push through those moments, they have a breakthrough.</p><p> Lack of confidence is the most common reason people avoid taking the next step in their career. They are afraid of failing, but even if you fall flat on your face, you are still moving forward. </p><p> Strong minds abandon the need for perfection. It&rsquo;s more important to grow and learn about yourself in the process.</p><p> <strong>  3. Strong Minds Don&rsquo;t Hide From New Life Experiences </strong></p><p> They embrace the rapid iteration of trial and error.</p><p> As children, we were naturally creative; trial-and-error is how we played. Back then, we were confident in our ability to play.</p><p> As adults, we are no longer as confident of our ability to problem solve so we avoid the challenges that come with taking it to the next level.</p><p> If you have the confidence and courage to try new strategies, each iteration will bring you closer to finding a solution or making a connection. This produces a feel-good neurological response as the rush of adrenaline hits our system. Adrenaline is a hormone that motivates us and makes us more confident in our abilities.</p><p> <strong>  4. Strong Minds Strengthen Their Good Attitude Muscle </strong></p><p> They know that success is not skill or talent; it is an attitude.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mindsetonline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research by Carol Dweck  </a> </u>  has found that often the brightest people are not the most successful ones. Some of the brightest people avoid challenges, dislike working hard, and wilt in the face of difficulty.</p><p> Confidence grows out of being a go-getter, thriving on challenges, persisting when things get difficult, and accomplishing more than expected.</p><p> <strong>  5. Strong Minds Know That Finding The Lesson Is Key </strong></p><p> They aren&rsquo;t afraid to try new hobbies or place themselves in situations where there is a high likelihood of failure.</p><p> One of the best ways to build your confidence is to learn a different skill-set by starting a new pastime. Your ego is not as invested in an avocation as it is in your career, so it will feel less threatened if you fail.  </p><p> You will have accomplished something just by trying. Whether you like it or not, you have learned something and can take confidence in the fact that you pushed yourself.</p><p> If you fail, or have a setback, you will know how it feels. Notice how you respond and take the time to learn from both the experience and your response. The more you understand how you respond to situations where you experience failure, you better you can craft the reaction you want.</p><p> Each time, you will build confidence in not only what you&rsquo;ve accomplished, but how you deal with disappointment, rejection, or failure. What doesn&rsquo;t kill you, will make you stronger&mdash;and more confident.</p><p> To build your confidence, you will need swim against your fear of failing as if the quality of life depends on it.

    "title": "Starting a Business in Retirement? 3 Must-Ask Questions",
    "link": "starting-a-business-in-retirement-3-must-ask-questions",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> There's one sure way to fail at starting a business in retirement</strong>&mdash; and that's by counting on its success. As a business owner, I'll tell it straight &mdash; running and growing a business is the hardest thing I have ever done.I've married and divorced, written a book, come close to death from complications from a motorcycle wreck, jumped out of an airplane three times, been through a lawsuit in federal court &mdash; none of these things come close to the challenges of running a business.I'm not trying to talk you out of it. Just letting you know what you're in for. It needs to be in your blood. And you cannot count on its success.Kauffman Foundation research shows the <u> <a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/multimedia/infographics/2013/kiea-1996-2012-infographic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  share of retirement-age entrepreneurs </a></u> (ages 55 &ndash; 65) grew from 14% to 23% from 1996 to 2012. This makes sense to me. At this age you've got the experience, and often the money. But that may not be enough.Here are three things to think about before you start a business in retirement:<strong> Are you cut out for this?</strong>You may have the best idea ever. That doesn't mean you'll enjoy the trials and tribulations that come with starting and growing a business. Are you ready to put in the hours you would with a newborn child? Are your leadership skills strong enough to develop a culture that will propel your business to success? What if it doesn't work out?Get to know yourself before you embark on this adventure. Use assessment tools to gain in-depth knowledge about your own talents. I've taken almost every assessment tool that's out there. The one I've found most useful is <u> <a href=\"http://www.kolbe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Kolbe </a></u>, a tool that measures your natural instinctive way of approaching problem solving. It has helped me value other team members who think differently than I do. I've also found <u> <a href=\"https://www.predictiveindex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Predictive Index </a></u> to be quite useful in understanding my team member's strengths.Talk to other business owners. List your strengths and your weaknesses. You're going to need to wear many hats. You'll need to figure out which ones you should wear, and which ones you should hire for. Be willing to pay for good help. And consider hiring a business coach. A good one will keep you focused on the path to success.<strong> How much of your money do you use?</strong>Don't be naive. Too many aspiring business owners think they will write a business plan and head to the bank, or to an online crowdfunding site, and someone will hand over the capital they need. Sure it could happen, or you could win the lottery.Chances are you'll need skin in the game. Do you tap home equity? What about liquidating retirement accounts? You'll need to explore the risks and tax consequences of various self-funding options.When it comes to cashing in retirement accounts I flat-out don't like the idea because retirement money has some unique creditor protection provided to you. Money in your 401(k) plan is protected at the federal level. Up to $1 million of IRA money is protected from bankruptcy. For anything other than bankruptcy, creditor protection on IRA money varies from state to state. Your retirement money is your nest egg &mdash; be cautious about risking it on a startup business.If you decide there is a portion of your retirement funds you're going to use, for those with larger account balances, there are ways to use the funds without cashing out. I talked to David Nilssen, CEO and co-founder of <u> <a href=\"http://www.guidantfinancial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Guidant Financial </a></u> about an option which involves setting up a corporation and your own 401(k) plan, then directing your 401(k) plan to buy company stock. I'll be honest, I thought I was going to be starkly opposed to his solution &mdash; but it turns out for the right person, I think it works well. It is 100% legal, you just have to <u> <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/od/careersinlaterlife/fl/IRA-Rollovers-for-Business-Start-Ups.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  set it up correctly </a></u>.David says that over 60% of the people they are working with are buying into a franchise concept of some sort. Buying into a franchise offers a pattern for success and helps reduce many of the typical risks associated with a true startup.When figuring out where to get the money, another resource to use is Retired Brains, run by fellow <u> <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/retirement/mentors/stories\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RetireMentor Art Koff </a></u>. Their <u> <a href=\"http://www.retiredbrains.com/EmploymentAssistance/StartYourOwnBusiness/FundingYourBusiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fund a business page </a></u> abounds with useful information.Regardless of how you fund your business, the key is making sure you have a backup plan.<strong> What is your Plan B?</strong>Before you start your business, develop a <u> <a href=\"http://moneyover55.about.com/b/2014/02/12/plan-b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Plan B </a></u>. That involves running future projections as if your business fails, and the capital you invested is gone. In that scenario, is life still palatable?I've seen too many people put too much money into a business trying to keep it afloat. If it doesn't make it, they're wiped out. Don't do this. Commit assets to Plan B so you have something to fall back on. Sure, the glamorous stories about a business owner risking everything and finding success have romantic appeal. Journalists seek out those rare stories because, well, they make a good story.This exercise isn't about a cup-half-empty view of the world. It's exactly the opposite. It's about freeing up your mental energy to start your business with confidence. When you've answered the \"What's the worst that could happen\" question, there's not much left to worry about.",

    "link": "how-to-delegate-effectively",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Unless you&rsquo;re a department of 1, doing everything yourself is not possible or recommended. </strong></p><p> When you&rsquo;re not effectively delegating, you feel overwhelmed, undervalued and stuck. You can only work so many hours in a day. You can only complete so many things within those hours. If you do not delegate work when possible, you increase the likelihood of delays and errors.</p><p> <strong>  Delegating isn&rsquo;t easy.  </strong> When you&rsquo;re the one accountable for timely, accurate completion of a task, it is hard to trust someone else to handle it. However, chances are that you have much more than just one task to complete. You probably have many tasks and some of them have to be complete at the same time. If that is the case, at some point, you&rsquo;re going to have to share the responsibility with someone else.</p><p> <strong>  This is especially true when you&rsquo;re in management. </strong> It is painful to watch managers who don&rsquo;t trust their subordinates as they try to strap all the tasks, duties and deadlines on their back. And it is worse to watch the managers take on lower level items because they are unwilling to share knowledge or credit with others for anything &hellip; While &ldquo;muscle managing&rdquo; can work for awhile, eventually it will backfire. Because when you&rsquo;re good at something, you will be asked to do more and to do it better and to do it faster and to do it cheaper. Eventually, you either burn out or breakdown from the weight of the pressure you brought on yourself by refusing to delegate.</p><p> When done with the right intentions and for the right reasons, delegating is good. What are the right intentions and reasons? Well, I&rsquo;m glad you asked:</p><li> <strong>  To create learning opportunity. </strong>  If we&rsquo;re handing off work to another person, they should learn something new or sharpen an existing skill from the experience.</li><li> <strong>  To create recognition opportunity.  </strong> If we&rsquo;re handing off work to another person, they should have a chance to let their strengths shine through from the experience.</li><li> <strong>  To create boundaries. </strong>  If we&rsquo;re handing off work to another person, it should be because that is the person, department or function best suited to complete the task.</li><li> <strong>  To create balance. </strong>  If we&rsquo;re handing off work to another person, it should be because you or someone else has too much to do while the other has too little so that delegating ensures everyone has enough. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re delegating for one or more of these reasons, you can rest assured you&rsquo;re delegating effectively. </strong></p><p> The other critical piece of effective delegating is the understanding of the other person. Since you are ultimately accountable for successful completion of the task, you must be sure the other person has a clear understanding of what needs to be done. What ensures clear understanding? Once again, I&rsquo;m glad you asked:</p><li> <strong>  State the objective, the desired outcome and all deadlines.  </strong> Be specific about what and when the end results should be.</li><li> <strong>  Define the boundaries. </strong>  Make clear where autonomy is expected and where approval is required.</li><li> <strong>  Suggest avenues of support. </strong>  Ensure all access and resources are available. Also ensure you are available to answer questions when needed. <br/>  </li><p> However, don&rsquo;t give so many instructions the person has no space for creativity or original thought. If you leave the person nothing to do but follow your instructions, you&rsquo;ve missed the point and you might as well have done it yourself. And if you work with people who require or request this level of instruction in order to do work, you need to work on their understanding of accountability &mdash; or make some staffing changes.</p><p> <strong>  To delegate effectively, you have to  do it for the right reasons and in the right way. </strong> When you arrange the work so that you are working on the tasks that have highest priority for you, and the people around you have their own challenging and rewarding work to focus on, you have set everyone on a path to performance success.</p><p> Now get to it!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Alex Pirouz </u></p><p> <strong>  We have all had the experience of throwing a stone in a pond and watching the waves ripple across the surface in ever expanding, concentric circles. </strong> Just as a ripple hits the shoreline, your reputation for the quality and quantity of service you render, precedes you in your marketplace.</p><p> Today, the gap between customers&rsquo; expectations and the service they receive can be huge. There&rsquo;s an explosion of communication channels that customers use&mdash; voice, digital channels like email and chat, and social channels like Facebook and Twitter.</p><p> Online customer service, in an increasingly web-based business world, is imperative if you want to retain a loyal customer base, doing business online means communicating with your customers in a different way &ndash; without the intimacy and interaction a shop front affords, your website needs to create a connection with the customer.</p><p> Toby Schulz co-founder of MyNappies.com.au has built his entire online business around providing exceptional customer service. He believes the key to truly providing great service regardless of what industry you operate in, is to:</p><p> &ldquo;You have to start building a relationship with every customer from their very first interaction, whether that be them signing up, placing an order or simply making an enquiry. By personalising this first interaction you achieve many things, the most important of which is that you start to build trust. In the online world, trust is king.</p><p> &ldquo;If your customers do not trust you and your business then no matter how good your product is they will not buy from you.</p><p> &ldquo;One way we surprise customers is by writing every first time customer a handwritten thank you card from one of the founders. This isn&rsquo;t something you can measure. But we feel it is something which we would love to receive. And if our customers know we take the time to write them a thoughtful note I think they are more likely to trust us and pay attention when we send them an email.&rdquo; Toby explains.</p><p> There has also been an explosion of touch points, like smart-phones, tablets, and self-service kiosks. Customers expect efficient, consistent, personalised service experiences across these channels and touch points. There&rsquo;s no denying that mastering the service experience is hard to do. Yet focusing on leveraging digital channels is one way customer service leaders can move the needle on customer experiences.</p><p> <strong>  Here are some ways how: </strong></p><p> Understand who your customers are <br/> Customers know what good service is and demand it from each interaction they have, over any communication channel that they use. Start by pinpointing the channels that your customers want to use, deploy them according to best practices, and monitor their uptake rates, which will change over time. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t offer digital silos </strong> <br/> Customers don&rsquo;t choose to interact with you on a single communication channel from start to finish. They interact with you over the most suitable channel for them at that point in time&mdash;which could be their mobile device, a chat session, a phone call, email, or Web self-service from their iPad. They expect to start a conversation on one channel and continue it over another without having to restart the conversation.</p><p> <strong>  Understand what your customers are trying to do </strong> <br/> Steer your customers to use the right channel for their questions, and maximise the value of that channel for them. For example, don&rsquo;t let them use email for time-sensitive requests&mdash;guide them toward a live-assist channel like chat or the phone. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Get away from one-size-fits-all service </strong> <br/> Customers expect personalised service&mdash;they expect you to know who they are, their purchased products, their service issues, and their channel preference. In addition, they would like to know whether you have read and responded to their feedback.</p><p> To be able to deliver a personalised service experience, customer service applications need to be integrated with other systems that hold customer information&mdash;customer databases, commerce platforms, product recommendation engines, web content management systems, and marketing automation apps, to name a few.</p><p> These pointers are just the tip of the iceberg in crafting winning customer service operations. There&rsquo;s also the selection of the right technologies and the implementation of the right business processes.</p><p> While customer support has typically been viewed as a cost of doing business, a great customer experience strengthens the customer-brand bond and encourages repeat sales. Each satisfied customer and positive experience will ripple throughout the social web in the form of online reviews, happy tweets and excellent word-of-mouth referrals.</p>",

Pompian, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New Jersey, 2012</p><p> <strong>  So much of the content around Behavioral Finance and Neuro Economics is simply new information. </strong> Albeit valuable information it often leaves both the practitioner and the individual investor left without an answer to the question, \"so what do i do?\" Pompian combines his research and insights into our fundamental cognitive and emotional biases together with research and insights into fundamental personality types. By doing this he has created easy to use archetypes and provides concrete, practical action steps for advisors and individual investors to use in order to avoid making big mistakes. <br/> <br/> The genuine value in this work is that Pompian provides a framework for how to treat biases in the asset allocation decision. Pompian's work truly aligns the higher purpose of the financial advice business. For the practitioner, the application of this work is really about improving the quality of the advice. The framework provides guidelines for how to answer these two central questions. First, when should and advisor attempt to moderate the way a client naturally behaves in order to counteract the effects of behavioral biases so that they can fit a predetermined asset allocation. ie. The recommended portfolio. Second, and alternatively to the first, when should advisors create asset allocations that adapt to clients' biases so that clients can comfortably abide by their asset allocation decision. <br/> <br/> This is practical, usable and valuable. <strong>  A must for anyone who professes to be a financial advisor. </strong></p><p>  </p>",

[Psst&hellip;that&rsquo;s a #RhetoricalStatement]Now that we&rsquo;ve got that out-of-the-way, I wanted to be sure you saw the  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3040399/7-email-habits-you-need-to-break?utm_source=facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   article from a few weeks ago on FastCompany.com that talks about the 7 Email Habits You Need To Break  </u>  . </a>   CONFESSION:  This is a completely self-serving post.  I&rsquo;m thinking that if I can get some of you to tame the email monster, then you&rsquo;ll have more time for social media marketing and your financial services practice!  &gt;smile&lt;In all seriousness, I believe Peggy Duncan ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=peggy+duncan&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   author of the book Conquer Email Overload with Better Habits, Etiquette and Outlook  </a> </u> ) has some easy-to-apply tips here that can immediately change the way you do email.  Several of these could really help get you out of the endless email pit and provide more structure to your day:</p><li> <strong>  Stop using &ldquo;Reply All&rdquo;. </strong>   Only send emails to the individuals who REALLY need to interact with the content.</li><li> <strong>  Be specific in your Subject lines. </strong>   Not only does it help the receiver know exactly what you want, but it makes searching and organizing your inbox so much better!</li><li> <strong>  Change your Subject lines.  </strong>  If you see an email in your box and you want to talk to that person about something else unrelated, change the subject line.  Again, be specific!</li><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t have to answer every email.   </strong> Don&rsquo;t abuse others with your one-liner emails.  Make &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; and &ldquo;ok&rdquo; an understood part of your culture.</li><li> <strong>  Stop email ADD. </strong>  Instead of responding quickly, respond thoughtfully.  Take extra time to think about what you want to say rather than the proverbially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back with you on this.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s just clogging up their emailbox!</li><li> <strong>  Alert!  If you&rsquo;re flagging all your emails to get people&rsquo;s attention &ndash; just stop doing it. </strong>  It&rsquo;s like that person&rsquo;s car in the parking lot whose alarm is going off over-and-over and we just walk by it.  If you follow #2 above and be specific &ndash; you&rsquo;ll probably not need the high priority flag again.</li><li> <strong>  Signatures are important.  </strong>  If it looks unprofessional, it might even make some receivers question if you&rsquo;re real.</li>As I read through this, I really thought it would be a review for me.  I handle of hundreds of emails each day.  Alas, I&rsquo;m very guilty of #5 though.  I respond too fast too often to emails.  So many of us operate on that &ldquo;service first&rdquo; mentality and we feel the need to have to react fast that we probably set ourselves up with clients in thinking every interaction has to be within seconds.  Is that really helpful though?  I get that we want to have expedient service, but maybe if slowed down and responded more thoughtfully one time it would be better received and would remove multiple contacts with the individual.  What do you think?I&rsquo;m really interested in your feedback! <u> <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bionicsocialite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Tweet me </a></u> or leave a comment.  I&rsquo;m very curious what you&rsquo;re finding is the most helpful email tip out there.Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!",

    "content": "<p> This is the final segment from the book written by Ruth Ross:  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Alive-Journey-Reengage-Career/dp/1935953648/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423754350&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coming+alive+the+journey+to+reengage+your+life+and+career\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Coming Alive: The Journey To Reengage Your Life And Career  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Help, I&rsquo;ve Fallen and I Can&rsquo;t Get Up </strong></p><p> Have you ever thought about what disengagement actually feels like? To many people it feels like being stuck in a pit of quicksand, unable to breathe or establish firm  footing and escape. Even though you are a CEO (remember, that&rsquo;s every one of us), it doesn&rsquo;t mean the choking nature of disengagement can&rsquo;t swallow you up. The ground doesn&rsquo;t care who you are when it gives way under your feet. Regardless of what role you play in your daily life (at work or home) disengagement can ensnare you in its trap.</p><p> People mired in quicksand usually panic and thrash around wildly, trying to find a way out. They move their arms and legs to get unstuck and reach safety, but that only makes the predicament worse as the sand shifts and envelops their panicking body. The reality is this: to find your way out of the quicksand, you have to stop moving, remain calm, and cry out for help. Unfortunately, many times there is no one around to hear your cries and help to pull you out. That&rsquo;s because most times those around you don&rsquo;t know that you are sinking into this bottomless pit in the first place. Just like the quicksand, disengagement can be a solitary process&mdash; you endure it alone. Disengaged employees don&rsquo;t call out, but rather they silently suffer until they are swallowed up in the worst way.</p><p> If you fall into this trap and find yourself sinking into the muck and mire of daily life, it can feel like a safe landing is nowhere to be found. There&rsquo;s no branch to hang onto or a rope to use to climb out of the hole. In a real pit of quicksand there&rsquo;s no time to create an escape plan because it comes upon you suddenly and without warning. And that is where the problem with disengagement differs. Disengagement is not an immediate quandary. There are warning signs if you are willing to open your eyes.</p><p> <strong>  The Face in the Mirror </strong></p><p> There comes a time when everyone should stop and really look in the mirror, not just to comb your hair or put on makeup, but to take stock of what&rsquo;s going on inside your soul and consider if you are about to step into an unmanageable scenario. Think of the self-assessment Invisibility Index Tool we talked about in chapter four as the mirror. Honestly answering those twenty questions by looking inward will help to paint a picture of engagement.</p><p> The first step to reengagement is finally admitting you&rsquo;re disengaged. As with any issue you face in life, it is far easier to come up with the solution if you can recognize the problem. Fear of the unknown is a paralyzing conundrum that can sink you further into the quicksand. But facing your truth may be the key to finding the escape hatch.</p><p> If you can&rsquo;t get a clear picture of engagement by looking in the mirror, find someone you trust to be that mirror for you. Give them permission to tell you what they see in your words and actions that paints a realistic portrait of your feelings about work and life.</p><p> <strong>  The Value of a Safe Landing </strong></p><p> There are examples all around us of ways that we are assured of a safe landing. As you near your destination when flying on a plane, you subconsciously listen for the grinding noise that signifies the lowering of the wheels in anticipation of landing. While there might be a slight jolt upon touching down, it&rsquo;s a welcome feeling. When a boat is attempting to dock safely, there are usually bumpers lining the pier to guide the captain into a tight space without scraping the sides and causing damage and potential injury.</p><p> Similarly, employees need to find their own way to ensure a soft landing spot in the workplace.</p><p> Engagement is like the wheels helping you to touch down in a safe place. It could even be the parachute guiding you to safety once you jump out of the plane. If you don&rsquo;t have a working ripcord to pull in time, your chute won&rsquo;t open. Everyone in the workforce today needs to have a thought-out plan for his or her own career. No one else can wear their metaphorical parachute for them.</p><p> I recently met with a very savvy female executive who told me about her own bout with disengagement. She struggles with the fact that the more she moves up in her company, the further away she gets from what she loves, which is the real tactical work and validation that come from doing a good job with the task at hand. She misses the creative process of hands-on work and doesn&rsquo;t get the same satisfaction from managing others who are doing what she wants to be involved in.</p><p> During the course of our discussion she explained to me that employees always have three choices at work. They are:</p><li> Be comfortable with the status quo by accepting that this job may not be fulfilling and engaging, but you are making an active choice to be okay with that.</li><li> Find your voice by speaking up and being proactive about your concerns. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to talk to your manager or others at work about your vision for what could possibly reengage you.</li><li> Make a decision to exit the organization if you realize that it will never get better, and search for a more engaging situation.</li><p> She offers some powerful lessons in recognizing and understanding where her engagement pivot-points reside and sticking to her guns to ensure that she doesn&rsquo;t suddenly find herself in a quicksand scenario.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important for all of us to remember that careers are a very long and arduous journey. There will be detours and bends in the road along the way. It&rsquo;s not always going to be a straight climb to the summit. You may need to take a few different routes and even stop to look out at the landscape while on the trip. It&rsquo;s all about creating a palette of various skills and experiences that may have you moving laterally rather than vertically. One needs to be engaged in the journey, not blinded by the destination.</p>",

    "link": "4-secrets-to-writing-an-effective-value-proposition-for-financial-advisors",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As both a marketing and sales professional, one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever had to create and articulate in my career has been either my own personal or my company&rsquo;s value proposition. It&rsquo;s definitely not a feat to be underestimated and it is something that is often over engineered to a point that can be confusing to some readers.</p><p> Typically, the value proposition lives on the home page of a website, your Twitter profile, LinkedIN company page, your company&rsquo;s brochure and practically anywhere where you expect to acquire exposure to an audience who knows nothing about who you are or what you do. The primary goal of your value proposition should be to convert your reader. What do I mean by convert? Well, it means converting your reader from being a complete stranger to someone who is willing to take another step towards trusting you and eventually spending money with you (which is the ultimate goal). This could involve clicking on something else on your website, flipping the page of your brochure, scrolling down the rest of your Twitter feed, or reading an article that you either shared or published. These are all considered conversions.</p><p> With that goal in mind, here are 4 common areas I tend to talk about with advisors when they are either creating their value proposition or considering re-writing it.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s Not All About You </strong></p><p> Many value propositions tend to have too much of a focus on the actual advisor or firm. It&rsquo;s important to describe who you are and what you do, but realistically, that comes at a later step. Keeping in mind the goal of capturing and enticing the reader just enough to convert, the first few words of your value proposition should contain some information as to how you help your reader solve problems. It&rsquo;s always good to remember that your business exists because it helps solve your clients&rsquo; problems. Some questions you can ask yourself to help get you thinking of a reader focused solution statement:</p><li> What are the top 3 problems you are helping your clients&rsquo; solve?</li><li> If you left your clients tomorrow and never replaced you, what would happen to them in a month, 6 months or a year? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Benefits Driven </strong></p><p> Another key component to your value proposition should contain one or more key benefits that you provide. A lot of people writing their value proposition statements for the first time tend to fall into the trap of writing about features vs. benefits. For example, the statement, &ldquo;We provide families with sustainable investment strategies&rdquo; is a features statement. A &ldquo;sustainable investment strategy&rdquo; is a service or an offering. It&rsquo;s not quite a benefit in the context of the example I provided. How about this one? &ldquo;We help families achieve financial freedom&rdquo;. This is clearly more in the direction of a benefits statement. &ldquo;Financial freedom&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t something you can offer &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; but you can implement specific strategies that can help families achieve that goal. One exercise I like to use with my clients to help them with a benefits statement is a fill in the blanks exercise:</p><li> Fill In The Blanks: The greatest challenge I solve for my clients is __________. By solving this challenge they can __________.</li><p> Tip: After writing a benefits statement, ask yourself the question &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; until you get to a point where the answer to the question becomes almost philosophical. Let&rsquo;s take the previous example:</p><li> We provide families with sustainable investment strategies. Why?</li><li> So they can save enough money. Why?</li><li> So they can achieve financial freedom. Why?</li><li> So they can live without worrying about debt. Why?</li><li> So they can live happily ever after. &lt;&ndash; philosophical point of achievement! <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Use Common Language </strong></p><p> There&rsquo;s many reasons to use common language in such a key part of your marketing material. For websites, using common language will help with your search engine results. Why? Because if you&rsquo;re using language that your clients or your target audience don&rsquo;t commonly use, chances are, they won&rsquo;t be using that language to located your website. The reasons why you would use common language from a marketing and writing standpoint is very analogous. The system and combinations of words we use is how we communicate with other people within our circles of influence. Using words that are not typically in your audience&rsquo;s vernacular can cause you to lose their attention.</p><p> <strong>  Keep it Short </strong></p><p> As marketers, one key consideration of any attention grabbing content is our audience&rsquo;s attention span which happens to be  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 seconds  </a> </u> . Keeping your value proposition short and simple are key to a successful conversion.</p><p> If you&rsquo;d like some feedback or help on your existing value proposition,  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:andrew.chung@veriday.com\">   drop me a line  </a> </u> !</p>",

    "link": "5-must-have-characteristics-of-inbound-marketing-websites",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> Inbound marketing &mdash; that is, marketing that is used to earn prospects&rsquo; attention to your website and lift your presence on search engines &mdash; provides a clear path toward a trusting customer relationship and industry authority.</p><p> Content marketing is often the focus of an inbound marketing strategy, but there&rsquo;s more to it than that.  A good corporate website is a crucial foundation for this type of marketing. Good inbound marketing websites rely on a careful combination of these five must-have characteristics:</p><p> <strong>  1. Deep-Rooted Strategy </strong></p><p> Inbound marketing websites feature lots of good, useful content.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/create-content-marketing-blueprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   But a content &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list is not a strategy  </a> </u> . Many companies take for granted that developing content and educating their customers is a Point A to Point B type of project. But the most important word here is not &ldquo;content,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy.&rdquo;</p><p> Businesses that start blogging without a plan are missing a key element of what makes inbound marketing websites successful: a focused, purposeful strategy.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a company to blog and see an increase in website visitors only to wonder why they&rsquo;re not getting any leads. Mapping out the entire  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/experts-creating-content-b2b-buyers-journey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   process that your buyer might follow  </a> </u>  &mdash; from finding your blog to downloading a guide and requesting pricing or a demo &mdash; is necessary if you want website visitors to become leads.</p><p> <strong>  2. Responsive Design </strong></p><p> While you need to track what proportion of visitors arrive at your website through mobile, tablet, or desktop search, inbound marketing websites need to meet the needs of all three visitor types.</p><p> You must design your website so that your customers have a consistent, compelling experience, no matter what device is used to access the site.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/what-is-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Responsive design  </a> </u>  is the answer.</p><p> <strong>  3. Social Media Integration </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s one thing to have company social media accounts&hellip; It&rsquo;s another thing to integrate those accounts with your company website.</p><p> As we mentioned on our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/seasonal-7-step-inbound-marketing-website-optimization-checklist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   7-step inbound marketing checklist  </a> </u> , you need to make sure that your customers can easily share your content and interact with your brand. That means using apps that allow you to pre-fill Facebook and Twitter updates that include your company handle, or setting up your blog comment platform to integrate each commenter&rsquo;s social media accounts.</p><p> <strong>  4. Conversion Opportunities </strong></p><p> It wouldn&rsquo;t be marketing if there wasn&rsquo;t an opportunity to make a sale. That&rsquo;s where conversion opportunities come in &mdash; those explicit opportunities for your customers to contact you to start a relationship, learn more or to make a purchase.</p><p> On most inbound marketing websites, conversion opportunities include the design, placement, and text of your  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34014/20-Critical-Do-s-and-Don-ts-for-Clickable-Calls-to-Action-SlideShare.aspx?__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1423496914888.1423757664345.9&amp;__hssc=268771694.5.1423757664345&amp;__hsfp=1449698273\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Calls to Action (CTAs), landing pages, and forms  </a> </u> . Design every element of these conversion opportunities to speak clearly to your target customer. Never rely on just a single &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; link.  Every webpage should have a conversion opportunity.</p><p> <strong>  5. Metrics / Accountability </strong></p><p> Finally, the most powerful characteristic of inbound marketing websites is that you can make decisions based off of customized, comprehensive data.</p><p> Your content strategy, design, social media, and conversion opportunities can all contribute data for you to help you make the most informed decisions possible and to inform your sales team.</p><p> Using website metrics to make decisions helps you customize each decision to your target audience &mdash; not make generic assumptions.</p><p> What&rsquo;s more is that your company should  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-accountability-profit-center/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rely on your website for new sales leads  </a> </u> .  It should be accountable for a certain number of leads and new business every month, just like a sales person.</p><p> Do you need help transforming your company website into an inbound marketing website that attracts qualified prospects and generates more leads?  Do you need better lead intelligence to help your sales team sell more effectively?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Let&rsquo;s talk  </a> </u> .</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/smart-marketing-template_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Which is most important: the first impression or the last impression? </strong> <br/> <br/> As you think about the customer experience, which impression is most impactful, the first one or the last one? Which one is the lasting impression? <br/> <br/> Let's think for a moment about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2011/12/customer-experience-lifecycle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer experience lifecycle  </a> </u> . If we think at that high level and consider when the customer first becomes aware of your brand/products: Did he hear a good story or a bad story? Which would you prefer he hears at this point? <br/> <br/> Consider when the customer walks into your store, goes to your website, or calls you by phone. Was that a pleasant experience? Was she greeted with a warm, friendly smile and \"hello?\" Was the entrance clean and uncluttered? Was the website intuitive? <br/> <br/> Those are all first impressions. What is the first thing that you want your customers to know or to see about your brand? I can guarantee you that it's something positive. If it isn't, then the chance that they'll pursue the purchase or a relationship is slim to none. No. Let's just call it as it is; the chance is none. <br/> <br/> Now let's think about the other end of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2011/12/customer-experience-lifecycle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer experience lifecycle  </a> </u> . Consider when your  customers are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   canceling their subscriptions or memberships  </a> </u>  or when they decide not to renew their product licenses. How do you handle that? Do you say \"good-bye\" with grace? Or do you rake  customers over the coals and force them to pay crazy termination fees - or worse yet, simply don't let them out of their contracts and continue to deduct monthly fees? <br/> <br/> Consider when the customer has finished his purchase on your website or is hanging up with your customer service agent. Does the agent thank the customer for his business, or does he simply hang up before the customer does? After the online purchase, does the customer get a confirmation page with a clear message stating that the order has been submitted, or does she get an error page or a redirect to some other page that has nothing to do with the transaction just completed? <br/> <br/> Those are all last impressions. How do you want the customer to remember you when it's all said and done? Do you want the customer to do business with you again in the future, should the need arise? Yes, of course. <br/> <br/> So, which one leaves a lasting impression? <br/> <br/> Honestly, they both do. The first impression sets the tone for what lies ahead; it sets expectations. The last impression is what we're left with; it's probably what we'll remember most about a brand. <br/> <br/> BUT... <br/> <br/> <strong>  You won't get one without the other. There won't be a last impression if you don't get the first impression right. You know what you need to do. </strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>  You never get a second chance to make a first impression. -attributed to both Oscar Wilde and Will Rogers </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  V-day can feel like D-Day. </strong></p><p> The day is, in my opinion, slightly ridiculous. But probably not for the reasons you think. I have no problem with the cheesy commercialized crap. I like cinnamon hearts and I even miss making those old-school valentines out of construction papers and doilies.</p><p> The ridiculousness is my expectations. When I&rsquo;m single, I beat myself up for not being with someone. And when I&rsquo;m with someone, I hold him to impossibly high standards. Is it too much to ask that my boyfriend give me a puppy with an engagement ring around his collar all while singing a song that he&rsquo;s written especially for me?!</p><p> Yup, my boyfriend is screwed.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not like I actually want another dog. I&rsquo;m certainly not ready to get engaged. And I&rsquo;m betting that he&rsquo;s tone-deaf (based on the fact that I&rsquo;ve never heard him sing).</p><p> So if I&rsquo;m not actually interested in any of those things, why do I want them so much? Where are these crazy expectations coming from?</p><p> <strong>  I WANT THE FEELING I THINK THEY WILL GIVE ME. </strong></p><li> A puppy makes me feel loved.</li><li> A ring makes me feel desirable.</li><li> A song makes me feel like I&rsquo;m worthy. <br/>  </li><p> So this Vday, I am going to give those feelings to myself, no ring needed. But before I jump into my action plan, I&rsquo;m going to digress for a minute. About a year ago, I wrote a post dispelling the all-too-common belief that self-love is selfish. Not surprisingly, this belief is perpetuated with dated (and crappy) definitions:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Self-love [self-luhv]  </strong> <br/> the instinct by which one&rsquo;s actions are directed to the promotion of one&rsquo;s own welfare or well-being, especially an excessive regard for one&rsquo;s own advantage. <br/> conceit; vanity. <br/> narcissism.&rdquo;</p><p> &mdash; Dictionary.com</p><p> It&rsquo;s no wonder we have such a hard time choosing to love ourselves before we love others. On a very deep level, we&rsquo;ve been conditioned to believe that we don&rsquo;t deserve it, that it&rsquo;s wrong, or that it&rsquo;s selfish to care for ourselves.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s largely why I expect someone else to give me the love I could be giving to myself.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re single or hitched, self-love is your primary relationship and the cornerstone of every healthy relationship to come.</p><p> <strong>  SO HERE&rsquo;S MY SELF-LOVE, I-DON&rsquo;T-NEED-A-RING, I-CAN-BUY-MY-OWN-DAMN-FLOWERS PLAN: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Create space. </strong> Despite all of your &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; you can still create space. To do this, commit to honoring your intuition for at least one day this week. That means listening to whatever your heart wants and then acting on it. And it&rsquo;s totally okay for that thing to be sitting on your couch and eating a pizza. For more on how to clear out your schedule and create space,  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/the-simple-math-of-happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   click here  </u>  . </a> <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Write yourself a love letter. </strong>  Not on a napkin. Not on an old receipt. Take out a piece of paper and actually write yourself a letter. Give yourself a dose of the love you&rsquo;ve been giving to others for so long and see how it feels. Until you&rsquo;re able to receive your own love, you&rsquo;re sure as hell not going to be able to genuinely give it to anyone else.</li><li> <p>  <strong>   Schedule in time for something indulgent.   </strong>  FYI, indulgent doesn&rsquo;t mean expensive. For me, a bath with candles, reading Harry Potter, or going for a long walk without the dog feels amazing. It&rsquo;s so easy to fill our time with our to-do list and never get around to things that bring us joy. When fun becomes an afterthought, it doesn&rsquo;t happen. Schedule it and savor it without the guilt. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Try something new.   </strong>  Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to connect to ourselves when we&rsquo;re out of our comfort zone. When we're trying something new, we have no choice but to tune in and rely on ourselves on a whole new level. Whether it&rsquo;s trying a new dance class or exploring a new part of town, getting outside of your comfort zone will help you to get outside of your head. It&rsquo;s hard to stress about something when you&rsquo;re focused on balancing in a new yoga pose. Connect and learn about yourself by getting in a new classroom (even if that classroom teaches you how to make doughnuts!) </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Make self-care a non-negotiable.   </strong>  During stressful transitions, self-care is usually the first thing to go. To make it happen, add in a layer of accountability. Make a chart and check off: </p></li><li> How much water you drank</li><li> How many hours you slept</li><li> Whether you meditated</li><li> If you exercised</li><li> One thing you&rsquo;re grateful for</li><li> One thing you did well <br/>  </li><p> It seems so obvious, but that simple tool helps to strengthen your self-love muscle until it&rsquo;s second nature.</p><p> <strong>  So, here&rsquo;s my Valentine&rsquo;s Day wish for you: </strong></p><p> <strong>  May you not get what you think you want. Instead, may you give yourself what you truly need. </strong></p> ",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Change is a ubiquitous occurrence that isn&rsquo;t always welcomed. </strong> The common question is: why do we need to change? The assumption here is that everything worked just fine before. Often times, we see the employee body as entitled and disgruntled when they are resistant to change.</p><p> We privately think &ldquo;suck it up&rdquo; you are lucky you still have a job. I&rsquo;m not so sure this is the right attitude. True enough, you cannot expect to have complete concurrence for every decision you make. Sometimes you just have to make a decision and pick up the pieces after.</p><p> <strong>  However, what if we owe our employees something more during the change management process? </strong> Perhaps, they feel ostracized or distant from the process. As leaders, isn&rsquo;t our job to not only manage the change, but to properly socialize it?</p><p> Here is the point where I believe we not only undermine the change management process, but we fail our employees. In order to have any measure of success in changing a process, policy or practice, you must consider its impact. Additionally,when the impact has been assessed-the overall change has to be communicated and socialized. When we take the attitude that our employees should accept change however rapid or difficult, we lose their attention, we lose their capacity to adapt and most importantly we lose their trust.</p><p> Where change is involved, the assumption is usually that management has made an intentional decision to disturb the peace. It is also assumed that the change is being implemented as a means to spite the employees. Call assumptions what you will, they are as good as any truth and employees believe them with all of their being. This is the sort of thing that we have to get ahead of. Assumptions about change hold less clout and we gain champions in our employees when they are part of the process.</p><p> <strong>  How do you make your employees part of the process? </strong></p><p> You make them part of the process by having a communication plan for the element that is changing. Use that plan to give them opportunities to not only see the change in a positive light, but to poke holes in it as well. Employees need to see it, feel it, touch it, and process it before it&rsquo;s rolled out. Change without warning feels like an organizational ambush. It&rsquo;s not only rude to blindside your employees with change, but it is certain that the actual change will be poorly adopted and unappreciated.</p><p> If adoption, acceptance, and successful implementation of the change are the goal, you would be wise to do the following:</p><li> Have a thorough blueprint for how the plan will be executed.</li><li> Communicate the change regularly and early in the change process.</li><li> Give opportunities for your employees to better understand the impact of the change.</li><li> If it is a systematic change, provide opportunities for groups to get a feel for the different way of doing things.</li><li> Where possible, allow for suggestions and/or input- especially if the change impacts how work gets done. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How have you socialized change in your organization? </strong></p>",

    "content": "Written by:<a href=\"http://www.snooth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Gabe Sasso </u></a> There are countless delicious wines you could enjoy with your Valentine this year, but this special holiday calls for more than just outstanding. You need a wine that tells a tale; one preferably told over a candle-lit dinner. With this in mind, here are ten terrific Valentine&rsquo;s Day bottles that provide intrinsically romantic stories -- in addition to a good drink.<br/> Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;This wine is so hot right now&hellip;&rdquo;  <br/> <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/vallformosa-cava-brut-rosado-origen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vallformosa Origen Brut Rosada ($20)  </a> </strong></u> The color red is everywhere on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, including this Cava. And everywhere you look  these days, you&rsquo;re seeing Cava. Exports are surging largely thanks to the Millennial generation&rsquo;s affinity for the beverage. Red flowers, strawberry and a bit of cr&egrave;me fraiche light up the nose. Red cherry and strawberry lead a cavalcade of fresh red fruit on the palate. White pepper and hints of hazelnut appear on the finish. This crisp Cava will pair well with an exceptionally wide range of foods. <u> <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/articles/catalan-sparklers-see-surge-in-2013-exports-to-us-germany-belgium/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Click here </a></u> for more Cava factoids. <br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;This wine comes with a REAL story&hellip;&rdquo;  <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/henrys-drive-shiraz-sparkling-the-scarlet-letter-nv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Henry&rsquo;s Drive The Scarlet Letter Sparkling Shiraz ($20.99)  </a> </strong></u> Henry&rsquo;s Drive wines each have a different theme tied to the Australian Postal Service, of all things. This offering combines the concept of love letters with Hawthorne&rsquo;s signature story, The Scarlet Letter. Black cherry and raspberry lead the nose. Oodles of bold dark berry fruits fill the juicy palate. The finish shows off a cornucopia of spices and chocolate covered raspberry characteristics. Whether you want to pair it with leg of lamb, pork or conversely rich chocolate desserts it will work. All of that makes this a delicious love letter for the big day. <u> <a href=\"http://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/s/the-scarlet-letter/the-scarlet-letter-at-a-glance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Click here </a></u> for Cliffs Notes on The Scarlet Letter.<br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re never going to believe this wine grape&hellip;&rdquo;  <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/santa-digna-brut-estelado-rose-torres-2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Miguel Torres Santa Digna Estelado Ros&eacute; ($23)  </a> </strong></u> This wine is made with the Pais wine grape, which used to be a mainstay in Chile but fell out of favor due to the rise of Bordeaux varietals. It produces low-tannin, easy-drinking red wines from incredibly old vines that were brought to Chile by the Peruvians in the 16th century. The success of this beautiful wine has help put the grape back on the map. Pais was a damsel in distress, now rescued &ndash; how romantic.  The nose is a bit austere and the palate perfectly dry with tenacious red fruits, loads of spice and a memorable finish. It&rsquo;s a perfect wine to kick-start a celebration! Learn more about the Chilean wine experience <u> <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/articles/wine-tasting-cruise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a></u>. <br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;This wine comes to us from Pierce Brosnan&hellip;&rdquo; <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/pedroncelli-block-007-cabernet-sauvignon-2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pedroncelli 2012 Block 007 Cabernet Sauvignon ($25)  </a> </strong></u> This selection comes from a single vineyard block in the Dry Creek Valley (Sonoma). It happens to be Block 007, so for all we know secret agent James Bond is involved (though the winery says otherwise). If he was involved he probably wouldn&rsquo;t tell us anyway. That makes this an intriguingly sexy and mysterious bottle for the holiday of romance. It&rsquo;s a bit enigmatic in the glass too: dark as night when you pour it. Its intense dark fruit aromas and bits of violet fill the nose. Tons of sweet berry fruit informs the layered palate. More dark fruits and wisps of chocolate continue on the lengthy finish. Click here or more sounds bites on <u> <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/articles/getting-to-know-sonoma-516/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sonoma wines </a></u>.<br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;This wine comes with a trip to the museum&hellip;&rdquo; <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/two-angels-petite-sirah-2009/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Two Angels 2009 Petite Sirah ($26.99)  </a> </strong></u> The label art for this wine dates to 1591. It comes from a painting by Flemish artist Jacob de Backer. The piece speaks to the yin-yang components of extreme drunkenness juxtaposed with the morning after aftermath. It was created as an allegorical warning to \"use wine sparingly or suffer the consequences.\" If you and your Valentine stick to just one bottle you&rsquo;ll likely only experience the unbridled joys. Plums, blueberries and violets appear on the nose. The palate is studded with mouthwatering black and purple fruits. Plum pudding spices, chocolate sauce and chicory are all part of the long finish. Pair it with a full flavored holiday meal.<br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Italy&hellip;&rsquo;nough said.&rdquo;  <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/avignonesi-vino-nobile-di-montepulciano-2011/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Avignonesi 2011 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano ($29)  </a> </strong></u> Italy is responsible for some of the most romantic wines in the world. This 100% Sangiovese wine brings to mind offerings from neighboring Brunello, but at a better value. Sip and contemplate this one over a leisurely meal with your love. Leather, violets and red plum aromas inform the nose. Red and black cherries and plums along with a host of spice fill the substantial palate. Earth, kirsch liqueur and leather are all apparent on the long finish. Firm, racy acid adds to the mouth quenching quality. Learn more about Vino Nobile di Montepulciano <u> <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/articles/italy-in-nine-part-vino-nobile-di-montepulciano/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a></u>.<br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;This wine will teach you how to dance&hellip;&rdquo; <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/rodney-strong-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast-2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rodney Strong Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir ($30)   </a> </strong></u> Rod Strong, the founder of Rodney Strong, was a professional dancer until he decided to bet it all on his love for wine. He was one of the first to plant extensive vineyards in Sonoma in the early 1960s, a time when wine was seldom found in the area. He eventually owned thousands of acres in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties. How&rsquo;s that for a story that gets you on your feet? Bits of cigar box and cherry fill the nose. The palate is stuffed with spices and red fruits. Cranberry, rhubarb and continued spices dominate the long, crisp finish. This is a very good Pinot for the price. Learn more about Rodney Strong <u> <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/winery/rodney-strong-vineyards-healdsburg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a></u>.<br/><u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/acorn-dolcetto-2011/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Acorn Winery 2011 Dolcetto ($33)  </a> </strong></u> Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;This Italian wine grape is the Next Big Thing&hellip;&rdquo; The story of Acorn Winery is one of love. Betsy and Bill Nachbaur have been tending the vines on their Russian River property for 25 years, and they raised their family on the land where they grow wine. Here, they&rsquo;ve poured their love into the Dolcetto wine grape, which brings high tannins with low acidity.  It hails from Italy, and is quietly growing in popularity. Black, brooding fruit fills the dense nose. Sour black and red fruits, cherry and rhubarb dominate the palate. Bitter chocolate and spice are present as well. Blackberry characteristics emerge on the lengthy finish. Click <u> <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/articles/dolcetto-is-back-5445/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a></u> to find out why Dolcetto is the next big grape.<br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible to visit Chile and France at the same time!&rdquo;  <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/santa-rita-triple-c-2010/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Santa Rita 2010 Triple C Red Blend ($39.99)  </a> </strong></u> This Bordeaux blend is a premier selection from Chile. It uses Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carm&eacute;n&egrave;re grapes &ndash; all the best of Bordeaux at an incredibly reasonably price. Grab this now before the prices shoot sky high! Cherry aromas and bits of spice emerge from the nose. Red and black fruits along with savory herbs dominate the remarkably cohesive palate. Rhubarb, black pepper, and minerals dot the memorable finish. <br/>Tell your Valentine, &ldquo;This is a Cali Cab&hellip;&rdquo; <u> <strong>  <a href=\"http://www.snooth.com/wine/smith-madrone-cabernet-sauvignon-estate-spring-mountain-district-2011/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smith Madrone 2011 Spring Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon ($48)  </a> </strong></u> California Cabernet is synonymous with quality. Brothers Stu and Charlie Smith have grown wine on their estate for over 40 years. The wines represent exceptional value, as the brothers keep their prices quite fair considering their premier location atop Spring Mountain in the Napa Valley. The elevation maxes out at 1,900 feet.  If you decide to take your sweetie for a visit to the winery someday, you&rsquo;ll be in for a real treat: The Smith Brothers personally host all tastings (by appointment only). This wine is top-notch, and there&rsquo;s nothing sexier than buying your love the best of something. Red and black fruit fills the nose of Cabernet Sauvignon along with hints of toast and vanilla. The palate is full flavored with excellent weight. White and black pepper, blackberry, and chocolate notes are all evident. Earth, cocoa, and plenty of spice are present on the persistent finish.",

    "content": "<p> $60bbl of oil will likely reduce shale oil production, negatively impact AK and be neutral for CO and ND</p><p> West Texas Intermediate oil contracts closed at ~$55bbl on 12/15/2014.  Soon after the oil swoon, Moody&rsquo;s placed Alaska on negative credit outlook without revising the state&rsquo;s AAA credit rating. We agree with Moody&rsquo;s assessment of Alaska&rsquo;s outlook and credit quality.  Alaska&rsquo;s budget and balance sheet are highly exposed to the price of crude oil.  Nearly 20% of Alaska&rsquo;s general fund revenue and 25% of the State&rsquo;s economic output comes from oil and gas extraction activity. Accordingly, forecasting oil production and price is extremely important to the State&rsquo;s fiscal condition, and boy did they get it wrong.</p><p> At the beginning of the 2015 budget process, Alaska forecasted oil at $105bbl.  The forecasting error will result in a material 2015 budget imbalance, and, as we showed in last week&rsquo;s note, the state faces long-term secular trends of lower oil production.  But it&rsquo;s not all bad news.  Alaska&rsquo;s Permanent Fund has $48.9B in AUM that buffers against any near term issues and supports balance sheet liquidity. </p><p> Now let&rsquo;s take a look at North Dakota. From the U.S. BEA table below we see economic activity from oil and gas extraction and supporting activities has accelerated since 2007. This economic boost has resulted in the lowest unemployment rate in the in the Union at 2.8% (Oct&rsquo;14).  The State is definitely at risk from $60bbl of oil, but we see the impact as neutral&mdash;and here&rsquo;s why. North Dakota runs a biennium budget process that builds in conservative oil and gas revenue estimates. The current average used in revenue estimates is $75 per barrel FY'14 and $80 per barrel in FY'15.  </p><p> The impact of lower crude oil prices on the state&rsquo;s general fund is limited due to a ceiling on oil and gas revenue of $300M annually. The remainder of the oil and gas tax revenues is used on a Pay-Go basis or saved for future uses in the Legacy Fund. In 2010, North Dakota established its Legacy Fund, which receives 30% of all revenue collected from oil and gas production and extraction taxes.  The Legacy Fund cannot be tapped until 2017, so the reserves are protected.  North Dakota&rsquo;s finances are in excellent shape. As a point of comparison, in FY&rsquo;13, North Dakota&rsquo;s undesignated fund balance was $2.1B versus California&rsquo;s negative $14.3B undesignated fund balance.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"124\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-13-at-3.02.56-PM.png\" width=\"870\"/></p><p> For our Colorado based clients, we see the fall in oil prices as credit neutral.  Colorado has benefited from the rise in shale oil extraction techniques.  The Green River Formation in the Piceance River Basin is now seen as a major source of shale oil reserves.  This has made Colorado a wildcatter hotspot.  Fortunately Colorado has a balanced economy. State real GDP comes from a combination of sources, including a large Federal Government presence at 12%, 8% from the information technology sector, 19% financial services industry and 14% from professional services. </p><p> Oil and gas and related activities are only 3.6% of real GDP.  Furthermore, the State of Colorado is well managed and there is a diverse offering of highly liquid and fundamentally sound credits from which to select.  Watch for next week&rsquo;s note about the big winners from lower oil prices &ndash; California and, surprisingly, Texas.</p><p> Sources: SNWAM Research, U.S. BEA, U.S. EIA</p>",

    "content": "<p> Ric Edelman and his wife Jean started their wealth management business in 1986, with no clients, no assets and no staff. Today, they&rsquo;re one of the nation&rsquo;s largest financial advisory firms with $14 Billion in assets under management, 26,000 clients, 100 advisors and 38 offices.</p><p> With these impressive accomplishments over nearly thirty, sometimes-harrowing years in the financial markets, it&rsquo;s safe to say that Ric is an expert in the wealth management business. That&rsquo;s why a recent article by Ric in  <u>  FA Magazine </u>  caught my attention.</p><p> In &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://shar.es/1oOQL5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What Got You Here Won&rsquo;t Get You There  </a> </u> &rdquo;, Ric explains in convincing fashion that professionals in the wealth management and financial advisory business are facing a period of profound and rapid change. In the article, he offers three courses of action for advisors. Rather than repeat them here, I encourage you to read his excellent article. The point is that change is coming and the advisors who intend to survive must be ready to keep up.</p><p> This got me thinking about the phenomenon of change and the ways we humans deal with it. When an industry &ndash; or a business &ndash; is faced with the prospect of change, what can leaders do to ensure that their people and organizations are equipped to adapt.</p><p> <strong>  We&rsquo;ve all heard the expression &ldquo;the only thing that&rsquo;s permanent is change&rdquo;, yet for most of us change is hard. In fact, according to neuroscientists, change is pain. </strong></p><p> In &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://t.co/4kgQ3R1Wiv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Neuroscience of Leadership, Breakthroughs in brain research explain how to make organizational transformation succeed  </a> </u> &rdquo;, authors David Rock and Jeffrey Schwartz offer an illuminating explanation for how our brains respond to change and some tactics for helping ourselves and our people deal with it more successfully.</p><p> What caught my eye in the research is the conclusion that leaders can mitigate the negative effects of change by changing the way they lead. This is accomplished in part by focusing not on past poor behavior, but on creating new behaviors guided by employees&rsquo; self insight.</p><p> Self insight, as I interpret it, is that aha moment each of us has when a concept, conviction or course of action forms in our mind, not necessarily because of what we were told or trained, but because it made sense for us in a certain place at a certain time.</p><p> Rock and Schwartz also observe that &ldquo;Expectation Shapes Reality&rdquo;, stating that &ldquo;Cognitive scientists are finding that people&rsquo;s mental maps, their theories, expectations, and attitudes, play a more central role in human perception than was previously understood.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, what we expect or how we feel about something &ndash; good or bad &ndash; has a defining effect on how we respond to the event. In this case, change.</p><p> Where does all this bring us?</p><li> Ric Edelman makes a compelling argument for change in &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://shar.es/1oOQL5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What Got You Here Won&rsquo;t Get You There  </a> </u> &rdquo;.</li><li> Yet in &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://t.co/4kgQ3R1Wiv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Neuroscience of Leadership  </a> </u> &rdquo; we learn that Change is pain. That deviating from engrained practices and patterns actually triggers the same regions in the brain that process pain signals.</li><li> The negative effects of change can be alleviated by managing expectations and leading in ways that evoke self-insight among the people we lead, people whose contribution we rely on for our ongoing success. No more &ldquo;my way or the highway&rdquo;, if you know what I mean. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The sum of these circumstances is this: Change must happen and it&rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable, if not painful. How we respond to these realities will, I believe, determine who wins and loses in today&rsquo;s rapidly evolving business environment. </strong></p><p> Companies who approach change as opportunity have the edge. These companies see change as the only way to remain valuable to changing customers and essential to the fulfillment of their mission. They engage all their people in the quest, and experience change as a shared challenge.</p><p> I approach this challenge as a communicator and a storyteller. Since we were kids, stories have had the power to demystify the unknown, define ideals, bring dreams to life and embolden us to overcome obstacles. The same things we want to accomplish together as we approach the painful business of change.</p><p> Through the power of story, companies have the opportunity to leverage change to their advantage: to transform their organizations, to make them more customer-centric, more efficient, more nimble, more competitive. Change isn&rsquo;t the enemy, and complaining won&rsquo;t make it go away. Change is the route you must take to realize the future you want to have.</p><p> <strong>  By framing the change in the context of a story you can set expectations and manage people in ways that brings out their best instead of triggering their fight-or-flight impulses. </strong></p><p> My advice to advisors and their firms, to any business faced with change, is to be thoughtful about developing a story that explains and justifies the change. Why are you here? What got you here? Why do you matter? What would your customers be missing if you weren&rsquo;t there for them, How are your customers changing? What must you do to continue to be an important part of your customers&rsquo; lives? Where are you going?</p><p> Your story should be personal, not corporate. It should honestly and openly communicate the struggles and victories along the way and gratefully acknowledge the contributions of individuals across your organization.</p><p> Mostly, your story must be believed, demonstrated and repeated. Over and over and over.</p><p> <strong>  Through the power of story, you can transform change from an enemy into a demanding ally. </strong> You might also transform your company. Go get &lsquo;em!</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  George Washingto  n </strong> , The first President of the United States: Here are some quik facts from the First grade artist: \"Washigton was born in Virginia. He was born in 1732. They were farmers. He liked to swim and fish.\" Well said.</p><p> In honor of this President's Day, we publish his inaguaral speech. It's a wonderful look back at when things were much simpler, when our country was unified and moving in one direction. Enjoy.</p><p> Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present month. On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years--a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is that if, in executing this task, I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me, and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated.</p><p> Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow- citizens at large less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency; and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence.</p><p> By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the President \"to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\" The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on another, that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality, and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world. I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire, since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage; between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity; since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained; and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.</p><p> Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good; for I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.</p><p> To the foregoing observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself, and will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honored with a call into the service of my country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departed; and being still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department, and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which I am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.</p><p> Having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the Human Race in humble supplication that, since He has been pleased to favor the American people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquillity, and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness, so His divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.</p> ",

We&rsquo;re talking not just about employees, but fully-engaged employees. In short, no organization should reach success unless their workers are happy and satisfied with their jobs. By taking part in an executive coaching program, you will realize that for your employees to perform at the highest level possible, you have to understand what it is that they really care about.</p><p> In order for you to encourage your team to do their best at work, you must be aware of their basic needs. These are the things your employees want you to know:</p><p> <strong>  1. They all want to be achievers. </strong></p><p> If you were once at the lower ranks before becoming a manager, then you know that moving up the career ladder is always an employee&rsquo;s goal. However, it will be hard for your team to achieve something if they don&rsquo;t know what it is they have to achieve. Thus, you have to communicate with them in a way that they will understand what goals you need them to reach.</p><p> <strong>  2. They want to be the best they can be, and they may need your help to do that. </strong></p><p> There are several ways a manager can help his team improve their performance, and one of them is through giving feedbacks. Employees need to hear both the good things and bad things they are doing. This is the only way they could figure out how to grow as professionals.</p><p> <strong>  3. They need some space at times. </strong></p><p> While it is good for a manager to guide his team along the way, workers also need to be on their own so they could make full use of their potential. If something goes wrong, you just have to correct them so that no same mistake will be made in the future.</p><p> <strong>  4. They need to have a purpose. </strong></p><p> Any person who does something for a worthy cause can easily find a reason to give it their best. Thus, it is important that you help your team see the important role they are playing in achieving company goals.</p><p> <strong>  5. They appreciate it if you could let them feel you care. </strong></p><p> At the end of the day, everyone in the workplace is just human. And as a human being, they have a need for relationships. You don&rsquo;t have to do so much, as long as you make them feel you care about them.</p><p> Knowing your team&rsquo;s needs is one thing, and giving them what they need is another. Any <u>  executive coaching expert </u> would emphasize the importance of engaging with employees as a way of keeping them motivated and productive. By satisfying your workers&rsquo; needs, you are setting a solid foundation for the success of your organization.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Firms that want their advisors to develop new business must create a firm culture that makes generating sales a way of life for the entire firm.  </strong> In the majority of advisory firms, the founder is the primary rainmaker.  He or she seems to have this innate ability or magical powers to create rain out of hay.  For far too long they have been the primary source of new business and the entire firm has grown up around them in support of their rainmaker role.</p><p> Many firm owners that I talk with share stories of frustration when it comes to getting their advisory staff to take on the vital role of developing new business. They think the answers lies in the compensation structure; however, I believe it takes more than a clever compensation plan to build a successful business development culture.  The answer lies in implementing these key strategies.</p><li> <strong>  Make business development a part of everything the firm does, and something that is the responsibility and part of the job description of every person in the firm. </strong> Developing activity based goals such as the # of phone calls/meetings, and the # of referrals will help to drive action and create accountability.  Activities drive results, and results such as new clients and net new assets can be measured and rewarded. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Hire people with the characteristics and traits associated with successful sales professionals.  </strong> The most successful sales people, in virtually any industry, possess the following traits and characteristics; relentlessly persistent, possess a strong goal orientation, are inquisitive and demonstrate attentive listening skills, are passionate and enthusiastic about their industry and product offering, and always take responsibility for their results.  I would challenge that these qualities are not trainable and that your best tactic is to hire individuals who possess some if not all of these attributes. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Train and coach your sales team and arm them with the right messaging so they can be successful in finding new clients. </strong>   I recommend the rainmaker(s) in the firm take on this important function or hire a sales &amp; marketing manager with a proven track record of success as a &ldquo;player coach&rdquo; for the firm. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Champion the business development cause. </strong> The leaders of the firm must communicate new business goals and report the progress that is being made towards achieving quarterly, semi-annual, and annual goals.  Make sure everyone knows the firm's business development plan and their role within that plan. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Invest in the right organizational structure, and the tools and resources that support the business development process.  </strong> Ask yourself what has been done to free up your advisors so they can spend more time working with client referrals and prospects?  If your organizational structure does not provide your advisors with leverage and they are spending all of their time servicing existing clients, how much time can they realistically commit to developing new business? To be successful advisors need to allocate time everyday to business development activities. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Reward and recognize the behaviors and outcomes that support your business development culture. </strong>   Your compensation plans should recognize activity and reward results.  Some tips to consider when incenting business development; only pay for clients that fit within your defined target, consider a hurdle or stepped incentives, meaning set a target for expected new business development and do not pay an incentive unless that target is hit. Make sure you align the actual timing of the payments with the timing of the contribution.  Model out the plan to confirm that the business can sustain the payouts over time.  Remember a firm that successfully creates a culture of business development won't have to rely on a few rainmakers to support the entire firm. Instead, each member of the firm, from the receptionist to the partners, can contribute their unique skills and insights to constantly improve existing client relationships and cultivate new ones.</li>",

    "content": "<p> Financial services information technology (IT) has transformed from order taker to strategic business partner. As part of this transformation, IT organizations are finding they must address key challenges with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/integration-solutions/soa/legacy-system-modernization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   legacy  </a> </u>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/integration-solutions/soa/legacy-system-modernization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   modernization  </a> </u> , data management and  <u>  digital transformation </u> .</p><p> MuleSoft has launched a three-part white paper series discussing these challenges and how financial institutions are overcoming them. In the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/soa/financial-services-legacy-modernization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first installment  </a> </u>  in our Connected Financial Institution white paper series, we discussed how aging back office systems, operational effectiveness and open source adoption are driving legacy modernization initiatives across the financial services industry. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/soa/financial-services-data-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   second installment  </a> </u>  in the series discusses key data management challenges facing firms including an ever-evolving regulatory compliance landscape, deepening customer relationships with a 360-degree view, and improving data driven decision making.</p><p> This third and final installment in our Connected Financial Institution white paper series discusses why financial institutions must prioritize their digital transformation strategies in response to challenges with innovation in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/api\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   APIs  </a> </u>  and apps, the battle over mobile services, and the increasing complexity of omni-channel delivery. We examine how institutions are responding to these business drivers, and propose best practices that can transform organizations and accelerate the pace of change. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-01-22-at-1.16.35-PM.png\" width=\"702\"/></p><p> <strong>  The Rise of APIs and Apps for Digital Transformation </strong></p><p> Used by software developers to assemble program components within an application, the new use of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/api\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   APIs  </a> </u>  is to make business functions available as components on the Internet and serving service-oriented architectures and mobile technologies. By allowing the integration and interaction of software applications, APIs are making it easier for financial services to deliver both traditional applications and mobile apps across multiple delivery channels with a single interaction point. They also provide the flexibility to redirect customer data back to the applications, apps, and devices that a particular consumer prefers to interact with.</p><p> <strong>  The Battle Over   <u>   Mobile  </u>   Services </strong></p><p> Nearly every industry is connected to mobile services, and everything that&rsquo;s connected to mobile services is experiencing exponential growth. As mobile continues to increasingly affect every aspect of a consumer&rsquo;s lives, financial services are having to rapidly expand their digital capabilities to meet the demand. According to Deloitte, mobile capabilities have quickly become table stakes. In fact, today almost all major banks,  <u>  <a href=\"http://mulesoft.com/integration-solutions/soa/insurance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   insurance  </a> </u>  companies, and investment firms have mobile apps.Whether it&rsquo;s hardware, software, features, or apps &ndash; the mobile  <u>  banking </u>  space has become increasingly competitive. Not only are financial institutions competing head-to-head against one another, but they are also competing against new entrants who are leapfrogging traditional financial services firms.</p><p> <strong>  The Increasing Complexity of Omni-Channel Delivery </strong></p><p> It used to be that when financial services firms worried about multi-channel delivery, their focus was on physical locations (branches, offices), call centers, ATMs, and Internet banking. Today, consumer demand for the latest technology is forcing them to look at extending their digital reach and expanding their delivery channels to include mobile, social  <u>  <a href=\"http://mulesoft.com/integration-solutions/soa/digital-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   media  </a> </u>  networks, and even the latest telematics and wearables (e.g. safe driving monitors, Google Glass, smart watches, wristbands) to engage consumers. However, success in this expanding omni-channel environment requires that financial services do more than simply connect to the Internet of Things (IoT). They must be able to truly engage with customers by creating an ever-present and ongoing dialog with them.</p><p> <strong>  Upcoming Webinar </strong></p><p> Integration and APIs have come together as firms need to get data out of <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/integration-solutions/soa/legacy-system-modernization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   legacy systems  </u>    </a> for consumption by digital devices and apps. MuleSoft&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/enterprise-integration\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Anypoint Platform  </u> </a>  addresses the challenge of quickly exposing legacy data to new digital delivery channels while minimizing changes to your back-end infrastructure. It provides a strategic integration approach that addresses legacy modernization, data management and digital transformation challenges on a single, unified platform. Instead of redesigning applications from the ground up to support digital transformation, the most agile companies are exposing them through APIs designed, tested and deployed using Anypoint Platform. MuleSoft is trusted by many financial services firms and  <u>  insurance </u>  companies, including 4 out of the top 10 global banks, to help them become a &ldquo;Connected Financial Institution.&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget to register for our webinar, &ldquo; <u>  Achieving Digital Transformation Nirvana in Financial Services </u> &ldquo; to learn more about digital transformation integration approaches.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.qnary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meghan Hubert  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  Seven seconds &ndash; that&rsquo;s the amount of time it takes for someone to form a first impression. </strong> Consider how initial impressions play out in the digital cosmos. Online identities exist on many evolving online platforms. Your digital footprint is a powerful tool to gain critical opportunities, to enhance your professional presence, and to drive business sales.</p><p> It takes just seven seconds to craft your online reputation. Are you taking full advantage of social media, SEO, and online platforms?</p><p> Here are five misconceptions and clarifications about online reputation management:</p><p> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t need to worry about your online reputation until it is damaged. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s not all about repairing the negative; at the core, reputation is about branding &mdash; cultivating a positive, distinguishable, and dynamic digital identity.</p><p> <strong>  You can control your own online reputation. </strong></p><p> A challenging battle between intention and reception erupts when it comes to online identities.  Feedback from social media  users becomes central to the way your brand is perceived. In this sense, you need to acknowledge that other people contribute to your reputation. The intention of your post may be lost and misconstrued; and it is important to monitor that feedback and react strategically.</p><p> <strong>  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is not important when it comes to your reputation </strong></p><p> Without SEO you risk the possibility of having negative comments and remarks about your company make their way to the top of the search results. With regular SEO work, positive content can become superior, pushing adverse and irrelevant content to the bottom of the search results.</p><p> <strong>  Your employees can&rsquo;t hurt your company&rsquo;s online reputation. </strong></p><p> Establishing and maintaining your company&rsquo;s online reputation extends to employees. In fact, relying on your employees to absorb and fortify your company&rsquo;s online reputation should be expected. If you don&rsquo;t believe us, just check out Glassdoor.com!</p><p> <strong>  Your online presence does not affect your offline presence. </strong></p><p> This misconception could not be further from the truth. Consistent interactions on social networks are vital to any business growth. The contemporary culture of the professional world is dominated by connections and interactions, maintained both online and offline.</p><p> Qnary&rsquo;s CEO Bant Breen discusses how social media plays a major role in shaping our online and offline identities  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pSvQgcYYE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> <strong>  Remember: You have seven seconds to make an impression &ndash; make it positive, make it bold, and make it cohesive.   </strong></p> ",

Regardless of whether the mark is large or small, there are four universal reasons are:</p><p> <strong>  1. Generate Brand Awarness </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. Generate Leads </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. Engagement with customers or prospects </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. Educate attendees. </strong></p><p> In a recent study of the B2B magazine we saw that the most common reason is to generate leads and customer engagement. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1176\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/las-razones-marekting-eventos.png\" width=\"1200\"/> <strong>  1. Generate Notoriety  </strong></p><p> A key point by which brands are doing events is to generate brand awareness and positioning.Event marketing allows you to cultivate this reason. Thanks to events that we can fully generate brand value proposition and make sharing. </p><p> Maybe your brand decides to participate in an event to align their brand vision to reality or for the public to potential can compare yourself with the competition. One of the key points of event marketing is that you are the owner of the platform (mean) generating attention instead of having to rent a \"media\" to generate that attention toward your audience potential (potential and current customers for example) .

They can be informative, interactive, immersive, ... anything to catch your lead and make it a Sales qualified lead or directly into a sales opportunity.</p><p> If your business does an event, maybe it would not hurt more than invite your prospects and your customers. The key is to invite people who you know are interested in the topic that you choose or put another way to make sure you'll have leads and qualify for your event.

    "content": "<strong> Here&rsquo;s a good question for you: if cars self-drive, what happens to motor insurance?</strong>The reason I ask the question is that I saw this really cool app in Ukraine from <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/12/privatbank-ukraine-an-innovator-like-few-others.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Privatbank</a> last year that allows me to drive into the gas station and refuel my car, without having to open the door.So what you might say?The so what is that, in the Ukraine, the winter is pretty brutal.You&rsquo;re talking -20 degrees or less.  So getting out of the car is a big deal as it&rsquo;s way cold.  Therefore, the bank did a deal with the gas fuel providers to create an app where you just drive in and touch the app for &euro;20 of fuel, and the station attendant does the rest.  Let the gas station company employee freeze their butt.  We stay warm and toasty in the car.<strong> So that&rsquo;s pretty cool, but I replied: so what happens when your car talks to the gas pump?</strong>This is the internet of things age, and the idea of machine-to-machine commerce is near upon us.  So why should I have to think about driving into a gas station and having some human freeze their butt off, when my car and the petrol pump can do all the talking to each other.In the age of the self-drive car, we should have the self-refuelling car too.This vision then says that the car drives into the gas station (whilst we still need gas, as mine will probably be a Tesla and using the national grid for power), and tells the pump it needs &euro;20 of fuel.  The pump auto inserts into the gas tank nozzle of the car and hey presto, away you go.But if my car is intelligent to drive itself and refuel itself, why would it ever be stupid enough to crash?  The car should now know what&rsquo;s around and be able to navigate any danger, using its smart sensors.<strong> So we now have cars that drive themselves, refuel themselves and never crash.  If the cars never crash, why do we need car insurance?</strong>Car insurance was only provided because us dumb-ass speed freak fast and furious testosterone fuelled males wanted to go around showing off whilst our female counterparts &hellip; oh, I&rsquo;m not going there.Look, what it comes down to is that if we will soon live in age where everything has sensors and nothing ever crashes, and then the whole nature of insurance changes.  We already have companies that only insure you for when you actually drive, like insurethebox.  These companies put technology into the car to monitor your vehicle usage so that you pay as you go, literally, and these black box based systems are just going to be more and more common.Take the example of the house insurer I was talking to the other day.  They were trialling a system that would have sensors in all of your windows, would know if a window was open or shut, would know from in-house sensors if you were in or out, and would intellisense what to do.  This is not just for protection from criminal access but, in the example they gave me, would automatically close the window if it knew it was open and you were out of the house.Alternatively, you could change settings to only close if you were out of the house, and there appeared to be a threat either by forced entry or from an imminent rain shower.<strong> In other words, your house is smart; your car is smart; everything is smart. </strong>In this age of machine-to-machine connectivity and communication, the whole nature of hazard changes from the traditional moral hazard of where you live to the new connectivity hazard of how well your assets are plugged into the network.That means that connecting your assets to the network will be your method of reducing risk, lowering premiums and ensuring you are better protected.  Unfortunately, it probably also means that those who cannot afford the latest gizmos will be the least protected.  That&rsquo;s the poor.<strong> The poor will pay higher premiums and have more hazard and exposure than the rich but then, hasn&rsquo;t it always been this way?</strong>",

    "content": "<p> For over a decade I have been practicing Yoga and it's helped me stay balanced, as much as one can expect from a Dominant D-Behavioral Type or Type A Personality like myself. It's been a process to focus on my breathing, taking time out of my busy schedule to stretch myself to the limit, but it's paid off. I am certainly calmer and more focused than 10 years ago.</p><p> One of my Yoga teachers, years ago kept saying. \" What's really important is that we take Yoga off the mat \".  At first I didn't quite understand what she meant, but then one day I walked out of the Yoga studio onto the parking lot and one of my fellow Yoga practitioners almost drove into me, because he was pulling out of his parking lot like Mario Andretti back in his days taking off from the pole position in a Formula One race.</p><p> That's when it clicked. Taking Yoga off the mat means that you practice Yoga and the principles every single day, which means that you should be more mindful, enjoying the moment, breathing, etc.</p><p> <strong>  Take Sales Training off the Mat (=out of the Classroom) </strong></p><p> The same principles hold true when it comes to sales training. We need to take it out of the classroom. That's why I am so passionate about our training model and process. Our program keeps the learners (=sales and service professionals) involved in the learning and real-life application process for 6-8 months. And I emphasize the importance of applying what they are learning.</p><p> <strong>  It doesn't matter how good sales training is, if it doesn't impact with long lasting effects, it won't make a discernible difference to a sales or service person&rsquo;s performance. </strong></p><p> But - and here comes the important part - the learner has to be willing to take the sales training out of the classroom. That means deliberately and strategically applying the principles of Consultative Selling every single day.</p><p> Most of the Yoga practitioners who attended the January session will be gone by April. Only the committed ones, the top performers (not that applies to Yoga)  will stay the course. In sales it's about performance, but we also have to be present and breathing never hurts. Sustainable change however will only happen if we take sales training off of the &ldquo;mat&rdquo; &ndash; out of the classroom. It's important to hear about overcoming objections, handling stalls, cold calling and prospecting techniques, etc. I know many sales people who have read every single book ever written about sales. They follow thought leaders and read the newest articles. Some of them are top performers, but too many are just good &ldquo;students&rdquo;. And by that I mean, that they can theoretically talk about these concepts, but they can't consistently and successfully apply them in real life.</p><p> And application is key to success. We see that in our sales training programs all the time. We ask participants to apply what they have learned, they are measured by their ability to transfer their knowledge to real live client interactions. Otherwise, spending time and money on training doesn't make sense. It won't have long lasting effects.</p><p> Whether it's practicing Yoga or doing sales training, we will best succeed and achieve our goals when we are able to take our practices out of the learning environment.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/blog.aspx?author=Erik%20Makinson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Erik Makinson  </a> </u></p><p> A large and professionally varied population of respondents to our  <u>  <a href=\"http://more.ecova.com/2015-Energy-Sustainability-Predictions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Energy and Sustainability Predictions  </a> </u>  survey made it clear that waste management provides an organization-wide opportunity to drive cost savings and sustainability. While waste ranks behind energy and water as the biggest opportunity for savings and improvement in 2015, our survey reveals growing awareness of waste disposal challenges across industries and job functions. A full 60 percent of the 500 energy, sustainability, facility, and finance professionals we surveyed said waste management is applicable to them.</p><p> Why? Perhaps because refuse&mdash;more so than water and energy&mdash;creates a tangible and daily reminder of its problematic disposal. Or, perhaps it&rsquo;s due to the 28 percent rise in waste disposal costs over the past ten years.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/waste-producer-price-index.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></p><p> As landfill tipping fees and the cost of diesel fuel continue to drive up hauling prices, the expectation is that the costs associated with waste collection and remediation will continue to rise next year and years to come.</p><p> The enterprise-wide opportunity to mitigate the rising cost of waste management isn&rsquo;t the only driver of waste awareness impacting our survey. Several California municipalities are setting national benchmarks on a host of waste management mandates, marked by bans on polystyrene packaging and plastic bags. Municipalities in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington have followed suit with similar bans, and mandatory composting and recycling initiatives of their own.</p><p> Faced with rising costs and regulatory pressure, more companies are implementing waste data analysis tools and prioritizing the outcomes they expect to achieve from those tools. The top priorities revealed by our survey are displayed in the following exhibit:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2-top-priorities-for-leveraging-waste-data-for-2015.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></p><p> The distribution of these priorities underscores the need for a comprehensive waste management solution that supports the objectives of a number of stakeholders. In fact, when we drill down into responses by role, we see that:</p><li> Final decision-makers (directors and C-level professionals) are most concerned with the optimization of service levels.  <br/>  </li><li> Finance and accounting professionals, on the other hand, are focused on improving pricing and terms. <br/>  </li><p> While priorities vary by role, both outcomes of waste data analysis can create incredible opportunities to drive efficiency and savings.</p><p> As is the case with energy, organizations have opportunities to reduce waste costs through contract negotiations. Costs, as well as regulatory noncompliance, can also be avoided by diverting less trash to landfills through composting and recycling initiatives. Waste data is the key to optimizing any of these opportunities. To learn more about the cost benefits of waste data analysis, read our recent white paper  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ecova.com/news-media/whitepapers/commercial-industrial/theres-money-in-the-trash.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   There&rsquo;s Money In The Trash  </a> </u> , or visit our  <u>  Ecova Waste Management solutions </u>  page.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I love watching other business owners in action. There is always something to be learned through the power of observation. In the last month, I witnessed two different business owners take a challenging situation and respond to it. Their responses could not have been more different.</p><p> <strong>  Not Owning It </strong></p><p> The setting: A well-known caf&eacute; in town that is known for some of the best French pastries to be had for miles (and miles). It was a busy Friday morning, but pretty typical for this location.</p><p> The situation: While busy, it seemed that the service was having a harder time than usual with keeping up with orders and latte making. Perhaps someone had called in sick. Despite some of the delays, customers didn&rsquo;t seem to be making a fuss (me included). But what happened next changed my good opinion pretty immediately</p><p> The owner and the response:  I recognized the owner as he brought over two employees to the end of the communal table I was sitting at. Things had calmed down somewhat, and I guess he wanted to chat with them. He proceeded to verbally lambaste them&mdash;profanity included&mdash;in front of me and the other customers at the table. When we all went quiet with our conversations, he looked up and realized what he had done. He quickly mumbled an apology to all of us and hastened away with the employees, leaving us all to uncomfortably return to our croissants and coffees. I haven&rsquo;t been back since.</p><p> <strong>  Owning It </strong></p><p> The setting: When I was in the midst of launching my new business, I reached out to a local print provider for business cards and stationery (I&rsquo;ve got a stationery and paper obsession, as those who know me well are fully aware). &ldquo;Buying Local&rdquo; is something I attempt to do whenever it is possible (and fiscally responsible).</p><p> The situation: I visited the owner at her store for a quick chat and we agreed I&rsquo;d email files over (which I did). And then nothing, as in no response. I left a voicemail. Still nothing. Figuring they had their hands full, and were not in need of new business, I ended up going with an online print provider. Once in a while, I&rsquo;d still wonder whatever happened with the local printer.</p><p> The owner and the response: Several weeks later, I received a deeply apologetic email from the owner. She was completely embarrassed that my order request had fallen through the cracks. It was a busy few weeks for them, but as she said in her message, &ldquo;that was no excuse.&rdquo; She pledged to make it up on any future business needs from my end. While I haven&rsquo;t taken her up on her offer as yet, I was impressed by her honesty, her willingness to &ldquo;own it&rdquo; and to make it right.  I will be back in her shop at some point.</p><p> <strong>  So, two very different responses to customer service issues. </strong> The first compounded the original issue by double (in my books), and the second ensured that the door to new business was cracked back open. I know which kind of owner I want to be, and I&rsquo;m guessing you do too. </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Dream BIG, Start Small, Begin Now! </strong></p><p> Much of what we achieve and accomplish in life is a result of our choices and the decisions we have made. As humans, we like to blame our condition or our results in life on external circumstances. It may be our lack of education, our poor parents, our lack of connections, and etc.  It&rsquo;s true&hellip;much of what we experience is as a result of the choices our parents made.</p><p> The fact is; some things we need to accept the way they are, since we can&rsquo;t change them. Like the family and country we were born into.</p><p> <strong>  Accept what you can&rsquo;t change </strong></p><p> Very much against my will, I was born as a capitalist into a communist environment. Having been raised and sheltered in the Hutterite-like confines of the Community Farm of the Brethren (founded by my grandfather, the late Julius Kubassek in 1940) was definitely not my idea. Like all the rest of the children on the Community Farm, I completed my formal education by the age of fourteen. Within two years of graduating, I was the community&rsquo;s shoe repairman and chicken man. Not even close to my dream of becoming a medical doctor (I had heard they made a lot of money).</p><p> <strong>  Start with what you have </strong></p><p> Since medical school was not an option with a grade 8 education, at the age of 16 I became interested in electricity and set a goal to become a licensed electrician. I would need to accomplish this without serving an apprenticeship or the possibility of attending trade school. Schooling outside the commune was not allowed because of the dangers of the influence the outside world would have on us. However; where there is a will, there is a way! Through a home-study course and some practical experience working in the trade while earning a dollar-a-day, I was licensed by the age of twenty-one and ready to leave the commune in search of a better way to live.</p><p> <strong>  Success is seldom found in your comfort zone </strong></p><p> On January 01, 1980, I left the Community Farm with $2,000 in my pocket, in pursuit of a future I had dreamt of since I was a child. My dream was to make it big in the outside world, to make a difference, and to leave an impact wherever I went. I was determined to make a huge success of myself in the outside business world. I would do whatever it would take to show those people wrong who said I&rsquo;d never survive on the outside. They tried to convince me that without an education and without contacts, I would never find a job that paid enough to support myself and a family. What those well-meaning people (my relatives) didn&rsquo;t know was that |I had been born an entrepreneur. I would not even look for a job, I had much bigger plans&hellip;I would create one. I would create a job for myself and eventually for hundreds of other people.</p><p> <strong>  Go To School, Get a Job&hellip; </strong></p><p> Too inexperienced to know about failure, I went right into business with my oldest brother Dave, forming a plumbing and electrical contracting partnership. Always ambitious, I devoured every book on goal-setting, success, money and business that I could get my hands on. Within six years I had achieved every goal I had set for my entire life; a beautiful wife, an adorable family and the home of my dreams on a hobby farm. I was driving a luxury automobile, owned three businesses and had a net-worth in excess of one million dollars. The only time I have spent in a university, has been to teach. While education is very valuable, there is no substitute for experience.</p><p> <strong>  5 reasons why you should start your own business </strong></p><li> You don&rsquo;t have the formal education to get a job that pays you what you are worth.</li><li> You live in developing country where jobs are scarce and under-employment is a problem. You have the contacts needed to get in the door.</li><li> You want to make a difference with your life. You want to leave a legacy, instead spending your best years building someone else&rsquo;s empire.</li><li> You like to have time freedom. People with their businesses can work when and where they wish to. They set their own schedule.</li><li> You want to write your paycheck. Self-employed people get to set their price and pay themselves accordingly. They also pay less in the way of taxes.</li><p> You can have results or excuses&hellip;NOT BOTH!</p><p> Forget about your excuses and focus on your abilities, your passion, and your dreams. Just start and you will find the resources. You will attract them! As long as you have excuses, you will not experience success, fulfillment, and happiness. You can make a difference. Just begin. Dream big and start small. You can do it!</p><p> <strong>  If you really want to do something, you&rsquo;ll find a way. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll find an excuse. </strong></p><p>  </p>",

Put one together as soon as you can, to get quantifiable feedback on such areas as your team&rsquo;s apparent ability to perform dependably, accurately, and consistently. Look into your clients&rsquo; views on service delivery, promptness of delivery, problem resolution, and empathy and, of course, the physical aspects of service, such as readability of statements, etc.</p><p> Consider surveying twenty-five percent of your clients every quarter, and think about linking a portion of compensation to the scores received.</p><p> The finesse of the client experience/productivity equation is achieved through knowing how much the level of service expected is going to cost you, relative to the anticipated revenue. If you can&rsquo;t calculate this, you simply will not know what your profit margin should be. And get down to the detail. Analyze every single client touch-point--understand the importance of each touch point and the cost of providing that touch point. Cover mail, electronic, telephone and face-to-face touch points. I learned many years ago to get into minute detail on this issue so that I could understand the cost and revenue attributable to every action chosen.</p><p> These steps may seem unnecessary, but trust me, even when the business is small this analysis helps to price elements of your service correctly, and to know when to balance client expectations, competitive offerings, and your own capabilities, resources and attitudes. Then, you can go out there with confidence knowing that your clients actually want what you promise, and whether you can deliver on those promises.</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the key aspects I&rsquo;ve learned about the hiring process over the last 20 years is that a well thought out and formal approach to hiring will serve your firm in a multitude of ways. Too often, hiring processes are left to a &ldquo;fly by the seat of your pants&rdquo; approach, which in the end, proves to be costly.</p><p> Formal hiring processes should start with:</p><p> <strong>  Clearly defined job descriptions and requirements </strong></p><p> It is essential to prepare and provide up-to-date job descriptions for employees to be successful. Include the skills, experience, knowledge, and education necessary for the position. Not only are job descriptions a valuable hiring tool, they should also provide a positive impact fostering consistency and clarity for everyone involved. Further utilize job descriptions as a communication guide and a means to review other workplace functions such as performance management, training, team development, compensation, and discipline.</p><p> <strong>  Training for interviewers </strong></p><p> While you may be a master at conducting interviews, frontline leaders usually aren&rsquo;t. The success of your hiring process depends on how well hiring managers and/or team members assess and select talent. Delegating interviews to team members who are not properly trained can lead to poor choices. Invest in proper training for interviewers or outsource interviews to a third party.</p><p> <strong>  A process to conduct effective interviews </strong></p><p> In order to achieve the best results possible, it is crucial to ensure a consistent interview structure. In the first minutes of an interview assess the candidate&rsquo;s appearance, confidence, and passion.  Don&rsquo;t forget to pick up on non-verbal communication by observing body language. Ask each candidate the same interview questions. Check out the list of 10 awesome interview questions below.</p><p> <strong>  Candidate testing   </strong></p><p> There is no doubt that knowing and understanding the needs of your industry, target audience, and clients contributes to success. With that said, knowing the business, the team, and oneself to enhance professional skills is too often overlooked and undervalued. <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/services/assessment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Candidate assessments </a> serve as a catalyst to gaining comprehensive solutions that enable you to make improved professional and people decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Input from other team members </strong></p><p> Incorporate a methodology that delivers input from other team members. By including current employees in the interview process you will gain a broader perspective and additional insight into each candidate that otherwise could be missed.</p><p> Better hiring results in improved team performance.  Without further ado, here is our list of 10 awesome interview questions.</p><li> <strong>   Tell me about yourself. </strong></li><li> <strong>   Why did you leave your last job? </strong></li><li> <strong>   What can you offer us that others cannot? </strong></li><li> <strong>   What are your strengths? Best skills? </strong></li><li> <strong>   What is your major weakness? </strong></li><li> <strong>   What qualifications do you have that you feel would make you successful here? </strong></li><li> <strong>   What are your career goals? Future plans? </strong></li><li> <strong>   What do you know about this company? </strong></li><li> <strong>   How many people have you managed/supervised in your recent position(s)? </strong></li><li> <strong>   What is most important to you in a work situation? </strong></li>",

If you want to get to the heart of important matters with your clients, then being authentic means you&rsquo;re honest, trustworthy, transparent, passionate with a little dollop of uniqueness thrown into the mix.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2013/global-trust-in-advertising-and-brand-messages.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nielsen report on global trust  </a> </u>  is one that&rsquo;s important to financial services, yet I rarely see it referenced.  That&rsquo;s sad.  Who better to learn about this level of trust than those who handle client&rsquo;s money and financial landscaping needs?  The reason I&rsquo;m so concerned about financial service professionals not knowing about this report is that word-of-mouth recommendations (earned advertising) is still the MOST INFLUENTIAL way to reach clients and is considered the most trustworthy type.  How many of your clients came from earned advertising?  Probably a lot!</p><p> Trust is earned through being honest with each other so it&rsquo;s a very important component to the mix.  To be perceived as being genuine, some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2015/26949/be-effective-by-being-authentic?adref=nlt020215\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   good questions asked in the MarketingProfs article  </a> </u>  for you to consider in your overall branding is:</p><li> What promises are we making?  How are we delivering on those promises?</li><li> How have we demonstrated our interest and investment into our clients&rsquo; needs and desires?</li><li> Are we relatable?</li><li> How have we let the customers &ldquo;in&rdquo;?</li><p> When was the last time you asked these questions of yourself?  Your staff?  If the answer is anything longer than six months ago, you have some work to do!  And be sure to be honest with yourself in answering.  Don&rsquo;t give the old standby answer to shuffle it off your list of to-do&rsquo;s.  This is important!</p><p> You might be asking yourself, &ldquo;Do heartfelt matters work in financial services?&rdquo; Check out this video by Prudential called &ldquo;The Love Card&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s worth the 5 min watch:</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Connected 24/7, available in multiple languages (depending on your lead base) and perfectly outlining your added value, your website is today&rsquo;s number one sales tool. But just like any new clients you got, wouldn&rsquo;t you be curious to know where did your clients &ndash; and leads &ndash; come from? what do they do on your website? what they like and dislike?&hellip;and most of all, as  <u>  presented in a previous post </u> , what can you do to get more leads and more conversion from the web? If indeed you are, then Google Analytics must be your best friend! But with so many reports available, it is easy to get lost. Let&rsquo;s find our way back with the 5 top Key Performance Indicators to check on Google Analytics.</p><p> <strong>  Traffic (Audience &gt; Overview) </strong></p><p> Your website&rsquo;s traffic is made of two main metrics: the number of &ldquo;users&rdquo; (the number of different people visiting your website) and the number of &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; (the number of interaction or visits a user had with your website). Now based on these two information, Google Analytics provides you more great data, the percentage of new VS returning visitors. Why does it matter? because it helps you understand if your website&rsquo;s content is attractive and engaging for your potential leads. Just like in traditional sales, the more a lead is interested in your offerings, the more he will interact with your firm. In the unfortunate case your website has more new visitors than returning ones, it can mean either your content is not engaging enough or your marketing efforts to advertise your firm are not directed to the proper audience. Promoting retirement consulting plan to college kids? probably a bit too soon!</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sam.png\" width=\"625\"/></p><p> <strong>  Sources of traffic (Acquisition &gt; Overview) </strong></p><p> One of Google Analytics&rsquo; main features is to provide you with the sources of your website traffic; to cut it off simple, where does your lead come from.</p><li> Direct &ndash; When visitors directly typed down your website&rsquo;s address.</li><li> Organic &ndash; When visitors found you while doing researches on Google, Bing or Yahoo.</li><li> Social &ndash; When leads clicked on a link displayed on your social media platforms (Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, etc).</li><li> Referral &ndash; When visitors used a link displayed on another website, like a business directory for example.</li><li> Email &ndash; When leads used a link shown on your own newsletter.</li><p> Thanks to these data, you will be able to better understand where your leads come from and, based on your new clients acquisition rate, focus your effort into a particular channel.</p><p> <strong>  Bouncing rate (Audience &gt; Overview) </strong></p><p> The bouncing rate is the percentage of people living from your website after viewing only one page. Now this is a VERY important information. Why? because it tells you whether a visitor is engaged - or &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; &ndash; with your website or not. Thanks to the traffic sources metrics, as well as others such as age or location, you can clearly pinpoint who&rsquo;s liking your website and who&rsquo;s not&hellip;and focus on finding solution. Maybe your content is not interesting for visitors coming from Facebook, but maybe it is more for visitors coming from referrals such as an interview about the latest Swiss National Bank move for instance. Besides, the overall structure and design of your website can also be the reason for a high bouncing rate; as indicated in one of my previous post, you got to  <u>  help visitors find the information they want as fast as possible </u> .</p><p> How do I know my bouncing rate is acceptable or not? well, it is very hard to define but luckily guys at KissMetrics shared a very interesting infographic to help you deal with this question, no matter the industry and website type; see below and click on it to get the full picture:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sam2.png\" width=\"570\"/></p><p> <strong>  Landing  page (Acquisition &gt; Overview &gt; Organic Search &gt; Secondary Dimension &gt; Landing Page) </strong></p><p> The landing page is the page your visitors end up at when click on your link. Now, when you place yourself the link of your choice, for a Social Media post or blog post, it is simple. But when it comes to Organic Search using keywords, it becomes a bit more complicated. Why so? because since a considerable amount of people surf on the web while connected to any Google product (Gmail, Google Plus for example), to protect their privacy, Google simply cannot display what keywords they use to find your links (this is the reason for the &ldquo;not provided&rdquo; answer you will have on this screen). However, if you know what are their landing pages, you can better narrow the scope of keyword these visitors used to arrive on your website&hellip;and better understand what is their prime interest. </p><p> <strong>  Average Session Duration (Audience &gt; Overview) </strong></p><p> Knowing how long a visitor stayed on your website is of a major importance because it tells you whether, depending on the profile of that particular visitor, your content and offerings are of interest. Therefore, the more someone stays on your site, the better. Google Analytics gives you the chance to cut down the average session time per page and per sources. Therefore, you can better understand where the visitors who stayed the longest on your site, are coming from (both in terms of channel and cities) so to better craft content and offers for them.</p><p> Google Analytics has many more metrics to help you better refine your website and overall online marketing strategy. Understanding how people are interacting with your website and what can you do to improve it is a worthy investment because just like any products or services, you want to know where your clients are coming from to get more of them as well as improve your own offerings.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I have been very fortunate to work for and be in the presence of some of the best leaders in the business. Although there are a ton of lessons learned, I have come to appreciate one fundamental building block that I have seen each of these great leaders use &ndash; the effective use of transparency.</p><p> I have taken those lessons from others and incorporated it into my leadership philosophy. I want people to know what is going on to ensure they have context about the situations that impact them. But over the years I have learned to appreciate the nuances of transparency. It is not a cut and dry application.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start by defining transparency. In its simplest form, it is the visibility given to an item when looking through a medium. To break it down into simple components, transparency comes down to:</p><li> The person getting the visibility</li><li> The &ldquo;medium&rdquo; giving the visibility</li><li> The item that is being shown</li><p> Then, look at leaders that you respect. What I saw from those I greatly admire was their ability to be that medium and determine the right amount of visibility to give. They did not treat transparency as a binary notion (i.e. all or none). Those truly great leaders figure out that transparency is actually a sliding scale that should be adjusted based on the circumstances. This applies for those situations where leaders have to manage up, across, and down. Depending on the audience and the item being shown, the truly great leaders figure out the right amount of transparency for the situation.</p><p> Does not giving 100% transparency mean that you are lying? Early in my career I would have said yes. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you give a person 100% of the information you have? But now I realize that leadership is not giving the right answers, it is working to find the right questions. But how does this translate to transparency? Well, how do you know if the information you are giving is correct if you have not figured out the right question? You don&rsquo;t. So if you think you have all of the answers and are giving that as your &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; to others, you are actually hindering the process of finding the right questions to ask.</p><p> My learning experience is not done, but truly enhanced by the realization that transparency should be a means to an end&hellip; not the end itself. When looking at your use of giving visibility to others, I would challenge you &ndash; are you using it to provide the answers or find the questions?</p>",

    "link": "have-you-skipped-over-protecting-your-most-valuable-asset",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> What would you say if I told you that you have a 25% chance of becoming disabled before you retire? According to the  <u>  Social Security Administration </u> , that&rsquo;s exactly what could happen, as over 1 in 4 of today&rsquo;s 20-year olds will experience some form of disability before age 67.</p><p> So what does that mean for you, who is likely reading this as a 20, 30, or 40-something? It means that it&rsquo;s time to educate yourself on the risks that are out there and what they could translate to if you don&rsquo;t have the right protection in place. Keep in mind that your ability to earn an income is likely your most valuable asset.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re like the majority of Americans, you work hard for your income &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s operating your own business or working as an employee of an amazing company. Your income comes from your talents, skills, education, and your ability to actually do the job.</p><p> So what happens if you can&rsquo;t actually perform your work? What would that do to your lifestyle, your family, and your goals? What happens if you&rsquo;re no longer able to actually earn that income?</p><p> That&rsquo;s where disability insurance comes into play.</p><p> For many Americans (millennials especially) this is an overlooked insurance. People think, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t happen to me,&rdquo; or perceive disability as something that happens only to the elderly. In reality,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/research/CDA_LTD_Claims_Survey_2014.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   long-term disabilities can manifest in the form of pregnancy complications, cancers, mental disorders, injuries and poisonings and more  </a> </u> .</p><p> So what do you need to know? Here are the facts:</p><p> According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Council for Disability Awareness  </a> </u> , the average long-term disability claim  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/chances_disability/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lasts 34.6 months  </a> </u>  (that&rsquo;s almost 3 years!). That means your average emergency fund likely won&rsquo;t protect you for the full term.</p><p> <strong>  What is Disability Insurance? </strong></p><p> Disability Insurance is a plan that provides for periodic payments of benefits when a disabled insured is unable to work. The insurance is designed to replace anywhere from 45% to 66 and 2/3% of your gross income should illness keep you from earning an income in your occupation.</p><p> It encompasses paid sick leave, short-term disability benefits (STD), and long-term disability benefits (LTD).</p><p> <strong>  Short-Term Disability (STD) </strong></p><p> Short-term disability coverage kicks in if you&rsquo;re out of work for a brief period, typically ranging from a few weeks to up to 90 days. Elimination periods are usually about a week or so before the benefits begin (income can be supplemented with sick or vacation time during this period).</p><p> The policy pays up to 66 and 2/3% of your income until the benefits run out or your long-term policy kicks in.</p><p> <strong>  Long-Term Disability </strong></p><p> Long-term disability policies pay for an extended period of time, typically up until you return to work, max out the policy for a certain number of years, or reach retirement age.</p><p> Elimination periods usually range around a few months, but can be longer and benefits kick in after your short-term benefits run out (if you have such a policy), paying up to 66 and 2/3% of your income.</p><p> <strong>  What if You&rsquo;re Self-Employed or Don&rsquo;t Have Employer Coverage? </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;ve read through your employee benefits (which I recommend you do), and you don&rsquo;t have income protection or if you&rsquo;re an entrepreneur and needing to obtain a private policy on your own, ensure you&rsquo;re looking at your earnings over the two most recent years when applying for coverage.</p><p> Shop around to different carriers and don&rsquo;t settle on the first product or provider you see. Working with a broker instead of an agent will give you access to a bigger variety of companies, but ultimately you&rsquo;ll want to talk to a CFP&reg; before purchasing a policy of your own in order to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the right coverage and protection.</p><p> <strong>  Where to Start and Questions to Ask: </strong></p><p> When obtaining or reviewing an income protection policy, look for and ask the following:</p><li> Does your employer provide coverage? If so, is it for short or long-term and what are the benefits and elimination periods?</li><li> Whether a group policy or a privately owned policy, ensure you read the fine print and understand maximum benefits, terms, and definitions.</li><li> Is it  &ldquo;any&rdquo; or &ldquo;own&rdquo; occupation coverage? (Meaning does it pay if you can&rsquo;t perform your own occupation or any job that meets your education and skill level?)</li><li> How much of your income will ultimately be replaced and for how long?</li><li> What is the elimination period (i.e. how long until the policy kicks in)?</li><li> How much should you have stashed away to cushion any elimination periods (i.e. will you save and self insure for any short-term disabilities)?</li><li> Will the benefits be pre-tax or post-tax? (This comes into play when participating in employer group policies. If you&rsquo;re paying premiums pre-tax or the company pays for you, your benefits will be taxable.)</li><li> Check out this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.disabilitycanhappen.org/preparing_disability/financial_plan.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Disability Security Plan  </a> </u>  from the Council for Disability Awareness.</li><li> Keep in mind that you can&rsquo;t replace 100% of your income with disability insurance and the goal is to provide protection, but also to give you an incentive to return to work.</li><p> So what do you do first? Start by working to build up your emergency fund, reviewing your employee benefits and coverage (or reaching out to your HR department), and reaching out to a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; to determine your insurance and coverage needs.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the three largest islands in the Mediterranean, Cyprus is also the warmest, delivering mild winters, and hot summers made wonderful by Mediterranean breezes. Mixing together a dozen cultural influences from various historic periods, the island&rsquo;s points of interest are as plentiful as its beautiful beaches and authentic cuisine, making it ideal for a private luxury yacht charter.</p><p> South of Turkey, North of Egypt, Southeast of Greece, and standing alone with a large percentage of pristine, undisturbed coastline, Cyprus is the perfect size for a week-long private luxury yacht charter itinerary, but has the depth and charm to continue exploration for more than a month. A &ldquo;meze&rdquo; of several ports of call, this 7-day itinerary provides just a small taste of the island.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2_4.png\" width=\"902\"/></p><p> Day 1: Phaphos offers everything from ancient culture, to the contemporary urban Bar Street. Through the centuries, foreign influence has given Paphos an array of interesting sites, from Roman monasteries and Byzantine castles, to Islamic mosques and Medieval baths. The Tombs of the Kings from the 4 th century BC offer exploration of amphorae stamped by the manufacturer at an exquisite ancient burial ground.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3_2.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> Day 2: Polis/Akamas invites visitors to swim in the Baths of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of pleasure, beauty, and love. Enjoy the beauty of an expansive nature reserve on the Akamas Peninsula. The area is also home to the Anasa Resort, with one of the most romantic, 24-seat, candlelit dinners at the island at the resort&rsquo;s most popular restaurant, the Asian-inspired Basilico. More tradtional fare is served at Pelagos, outdoors overlooking the sea.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4_1.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> Day 3: Kyrenia is one of the busiest ports in Cyprus, attracting visitors with vibrant nightlife and a young population due to two universities. Host to cultural and art fairs, the city also attracts a trendsetting creative crowd. The busy waterfront finds charming restaurants and shops overlooking the harbor, inviting an interesting land-based evening.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5_1.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> Day 4: Cruising to the Northeast point, you&rsquo;ll find the Klidhes Islands and a protected nature reserve, home to impressive and beautiful bird populations. This lovely archipelago reaching out from the Karpasia Peninsula will find you cruising through clear blue water, around undisturbed coastal areas. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/6.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> Day 5: Cape Greco, with the resorts at Protara and Ayia Napa, has some of the clearest blue water, rimmed with probably the most abundant &ldquo;blue flag&rdquo; beaches on the island of Cyprus, cited for cleanliness. Quiet beauty by day, Ayia Napa is a clubbing headquarters on Cyprus, gathering beautiful people for dancing and celebrating on a nightly basis. Be seen at The Castle Club if you dare. Or, plan a more sedate evening on board your private yacht charter, with wine, a special dinner prepared by your private chef, and your own personal sunset.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/7.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> Day 6: Limassol is another busy, urban port, simply brimming over with the blend of Turkish and Greek culture. Enjoy the yacht and the sun by day, but when the sun tucks in, tender to land. Try some of the local wines at the tavernas, and nibble the fish meze, small plates, for a culinary adventure, often from the sea. Clubs and bars abound, giving guests the option of a glamorous night out, or an intimate evening on board.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/8.png\" width=\"471\"/></p><p> Day 7: It&rsquo;s back to Paphos for the last day on the itinerary, soaking up the sun and serenity along the way. Shop for silver, hand made lace, and a little local wine, then begin making plans for your next charter. Contact <u>  <a href=\"mailto:Steve@TheBestofYachting.com\">   Steve@TheBestofYachting.com  </a> </u> to arrange the details for a yacht that dovetails your every need, and a gracious crew that attentively serves you and your guests.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Many clients recognize the benefits of using life insurance as an investment, but they can be sold on this premise with optimistic assumptions - which are often at odds with reality.</p><li> Cash values will increase every year with optimistic market performance.</li><li> Eventually premiums can be discontinued and investment performance will maintain the policy.</li><p> Those assumptions are made primarily when dealing in variable policies, but universal life and indexed universal life policies are also subject to this kind of rose-colored thinking. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The first thing an RIA should do is dispel unwarranted optimism the client may have heard elsewhere. </strong> <br/> <br/> This is not a reflection on anyone&rsquo;s intentions, but there is no way to predict where the market is going to be, or what interest rates are going to do. The best anyone can do is offer a ballpark figure, but using conservative numbers. Illustrations can only assume a constant rate of return on a variable policy - but even with a conservative course of action aiming for a 5% return every year, for all intents and purposes there is no chance that person will realize a 5% return, every single year, for many years.  <strong>  So clients should be made aware of the need to monitor these policies, just as they do their investment portfolios. </strong> <br/> <br/> Another erroneous assumption insurance agents often make, especially with variable policies, is relying too heavily on historical data. <br/> <br/> Typically, any 20- or 40-year S&amp;P 500 historical will show average rates of return at 8% or higher. Such overly optimistic or misleading projections are part of the reason there are so many policies falling apart today. During the heydays of variable policies, from the 1990s to the early 2000s, they were being projected to have 12-14% rates of return. These unsustainable, high rates of return were the result of the market outperforming during that time period.  <strong>  Now many of those policies are &ldquo;underwater.&rdquo; </strong> <br/> <br/> Instead of relying on historical data, policies should be closely monitored and managed. When the market is down, people should be paying above their premiums in order to compensate. If a policy is not monitored on an annual basis, or at least every other year, the policyholder is not going to realize that they have missed these marks until they&rsquo;ve past the point of no return and are underwater. <br/> <br/> Another popular investment-based product in the insurance industry are index policies.  <strong>  Index policies typically feature a cap and a floor.  </strong> For example, a policyholder may get a 0% floor, which means that he or she cannot be credited anything less than 0 - so it essentially protects from down markets.  <strong>  However, it does not guarantee a client will never lose money. </strong>  There are still fees and expenses being drawn from the policy, and during down markets, cash values can decline. <br/> <br/> Once again, assuming historical data for these contracts is unfair. Many illustrations show what a policy would have been credited over the past 20 years based on the market&rsquo;s return. However, it is unlikely that the caps on the policies would have stayed constant at today&rsquo;s rates. We have already seen caps fluctuate over the past four years, to assume that a 12% cap today would have been realistic during every market cycle of the last 20 years is unrealistic. <br/> <br/> That is the reason it is so vital that RIAs look at their clients&rsquo; policies every year. If the client puts more money into the policy when the market is down, when it does rally, those increased payments will make up for it. <br/> <br/> It is important that an RIA&rsquo;s client knows how important it is to not be overly optimistic with their assumptions, or everything built on that assumption risks falling apart.</p>",

    "title": "Top 10 Tips for a Bulletproof Transition — Part II",
    "link": "top-10-tips-for-a-bulletproof-transition-part-ii",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Last week, I shared Part I of &ldquo; <a href=\"/strategies/advisors-in-transition/top-10-tips-to-a-bulletproof-transition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Top 10 Tips to a Bulletproof Transition  </u> </a> &rdquo; for financial advisors contemplating moving their business.  While an undesirable step for many, conducting an effective transition is certainly attainable.  Yet some advisors are hesitant to pursue their evolving professional goals due to the interruption associated with a transition.My mantra remains the same:  Don&rsquo;t let this interruption deter you.  A thoughtful, well-calculated transition will likely yield benefits that endure for years!To review: <strong>  1. Engage Lega/ / Compliance FIRST2. Analyze Your Business3. Compare Product &amp; Services4. Assemble a Transition Team5. Develop a Coordinated Tranisition Plan </strong> For more suggestions on how you can execute on a successful transition, I&rsquo;ve highlighted the remaining Top 10 Tips below: <strong>  6. Develop your &ldquo;Why&rdquo; </strong></p><li> The importance of being able to passionately and succinctly convey why you are making a change cannot be overstated.  Be genuine.  Itemize the benefits your clients will likely enjoy as a result of the transition before asking them to endure even the slightest inconvenience.  Engage their hearts as well by reminding them how significant they are to your business&rsquo; success and your desired goal.  You should develop benefit statements for all of your related audiences too, such as employees, COIs, prospects, strategic partners and vendors, etc.   This is an ideal opportunity to rally your entire supporting cast around your cause and endear yourself to them in the process.</li><strong> 7. Craft a Comprehensive Communication Plan</strong><li> Once you&rsquo;ve developed your messaging, explore how to best communicate it and when.  Be sure to consult with your legal/compliance provider.  Additionally, it may warrant hiring a marketing/PR firm to help you develop and execute on this aspect.  As you consider your audiences, you will need to decide how to best reach them:  a letter, an email, a post on your website or some combination.  Potentially your news could be shared via press release or in local/industry trade publications too.  All social media should be in synch as well.</li><li> In your communications, pay special attention to setting expectations and providing instructions.  You will probably have to ask your clients to take some action.  Ensure you have validated every aspect of the process.  (Perhaps simulate the experience?)  Convey all the steps in new account set-up and the mechanics of the account transfer process.  Explain the paperwork they will be asked to sign and what it accomplishes.  Don&rsquo;t forget to address vital client matters such as access to funds and online portals, downtime with ATM cards and checks, interruptions with systematic withdrawals or contributions, or anticipated client travel.  Above all, do not guarantee perfection &ndash; it won&rsquo;t be perfect.  Rather, emphasize your team&rsquo;s thoughtful plan to execute on a transition with the greatest amount of expediency and least amount of inconvenience.  Reassure your clients that you have worked tirelessly to minimize surprises, yet should any occur, your team will swiftly resolve all client matters.</li><strong> 8. Execute a Flawless Resignation</strong><li> As with every major undertaking in this process, you want to ensure the details of your resignation meet the legal/compliance litmus test.  You must understand what should be said/written when giving notice to your current firm, when in the process it should delivered, and what the immediate next steps are.  For some advisors, it will mean notifying their contra firm, filing forms and giving instructions to overnight client paperwork.  In other situations, advisors may have the luxury of 30 days or more to notify clients of an impending change once the current firm has been notified.  Regardless of when and how you resign, ensure it&rsquo;s to the letter of your legal/compliance guidance.  And don&rsquo;t assume anything.  Ask.</li><strong> 9. Establish and Synchronize Technology</strong><li> Guidance around how to evaluate your technology needs is entirely another post.  Assuming you have selected your new technology, or have secured updated licensing agreements, you&rsquo;ll want to ensure you understand when access to existing solutions will cease.  And as important, you&rsquo;ll want to have new technology up and running on or before your start date.  The more common items will be phones, computers, new Website (or at least an updated landing page with new contact info), and Portfolio Accounting &amp; Reporting and CRM systems, if applicable.  Predetermine what data should be converted to new solutions, if it can be, by whom, and when.  And absolutely confirm what data will not follow you &ndash; the most common being clients&rsquo; historical performance.</li><strong> 10. Celebrate Success</strong><li> No matter how big or small a transition, it will require much investment from many people&ndash; both physical and emotional.  And in most cases, the extra work is in addition to the &ldquo;day job.&rdquo;  Show your appreciation by acknowledging a total team effort and a job well done.  Celebrate with a small token of gratitude such as a gift card or something grander like a bonus .  Include your Clients in the appreciation and send a thank you note with snapshots of your team in the new setting and highlight positive results and fun facts.  Or host an open house at your new office location and let them experience it for themselves.  Don&rsquo;t miss an opportunity to thank them for their contributions and connect them to your mutual success.</li>",

    "content": "<p> A well structured and rehearsed elevator pitch should create interest and a bit of intrigue in the mind of the investor.</p>The elevator pitch must be concise and include the following elements: (1) position the company in the mind of the investor, (2) identify the company and its key product or service, (3) define the competitive advantage or unique selling proposition and (4) provoke interest and follow-on questions.<br/> Thereafter, presuming and hoping that a longer conversation ensues, the pitcher should be prepared to (5) define the problem that exists, (6) explain how existing products and services are insufficient, (7) define the target market size and growth rate, (8) discuss existing competitors and how your company differentiates itself, (9) explain the business model, (10) define the milestones moving forward, and (11) provide an approximate amount of investment being sought. As for keeping the pitch brief, start by writing down 10-15 one-sentence expressions of the key points that could be made for the business opportunity and then work diligently to first prioritize them (what are the three to five most important points), make the statements concise and impactful (check your thesaurus to improve the choice of words for maximizing the effect of the words chosen), and then work to get the initial pitch down to 30 seconds or less. Practice, practice, practice. One should be prepared to deliver subsequent verbal information &ldquo;packets&rdquo; that are longer (perhaps even up to two minutes) that may focus on, for instance, the revenue model, technology to be deployed, market size and characteristics, etc. The particular supportive packet to be delivered will depend upon the question being asked. As for generating follow-on questions it is useful to have in mind how a novel might be written; that is, disclosing some starting information initially but keeping back until the proper question is asked the greater and hopefully more interesting details. Said in another way, be patient with the delivery of information and don&rsquo;t explode at the beginning of the pitch with too many details. Constructing the visual image requires that an organizing mental platform for the receiver&rsquo;s mind (skeleton) be constructed first upon which muscle (details) can be attached in subsequent layers of conversation. It may seem a bit complex to think this through, but it is well worth the effort. All questions and contributions are welcome.   ",

    "content": "<p> Mail has been opened, bills have been paid and your files have been updated. Mission accomplished! But, before you strut your satisfied self to the trash with sorted mail and old documents, think twice about what you throw away. Consider tossing personal information the equivalent of leaving keys in an unlocked car. Can you say, \"Pick me, criminal.  Pick me!\"? </p><p> Allow us to answer the questions we know are running through your mind right about now...</p><p> What do I (really) need to shred?  ...Are you sitting down?  Almost all mail that comes your way is worth shredding. Criminal-friendly information includes your address, medical details, birth date, account numbers, Social Security number and, of course, passwords. You should be shredding your utility bills, credit card and bank statements, explanations of medical benefits and most old receipts. Not to worry, you can still toss the unsolicited discount booklets, investment prospectuses available online and that stack of magazines you'll never get around to reading.</p><p> What do I (really) need to keep?  It's tough to remember what is file-worthy. Generally, you&rsquo;ll want to save legal documents forever, tax documents for seven years and everything else less than a year.  Keep our handy list by your desk so you&rsquo;ll know what can go to shredsville and when.   </p><p> But, what if I hate shredding?  In the words of The Fray, \"sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same.\" We&rsquo;re not fans of shredding for hours either, so consider a shred party while catching up on your DVR or paying your local  <a href=\"http://www.fedex.com/locate/index.html?locale=en_US&amp;appId=WFXK#start\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  FedEx Office </a>  or other professional shredding company a visit to do the dirty work.  One pound of shred can run for under a dollar.  </p><p> So, no more excuses for careless discarding!

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  I&rsquo;m in Pre-Sales, Social Selling is Nothing to do with me, right? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Wrong! </strong></p><p> Social Selling has many facets through the desire building and direct sales process. This includes Demand Generation (which should probably be called Social Marketing or Social Prospecting) through to closing a deal.</p><p> Pre-Sales can play an active role, in fact with the world changing, pre-sales people need to change to meet the world today.</p><p> <strong>  Social Selling for Pre-Sales &ndash; The Basics </strong></p><p> If a pre-sales person goes to meet a customer in the world we live into, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the prospect will have checked you out on LinkedIn before you arrive. If you have a boring LinkedIn profile, the prospect will be expecting a boring meeting. You have lost before you have started. <br/> <br/> (Whenever I go to a meeting I send a LinkedIn connection request ahead of time.  That, maybe a Blog for another day.)</p><p> This way, I hope, my prospects and customers will be thinking &ldquo;Wow, looking forward to meeting this guy!&rdquo; <br/> <br/> Which means I already I have a competitive advantage over the &ldquo;corporate suit&rdquo; LinkedIn profiles.</p><p> <strong>  Customers Want to Meet Thought Leaders not Thought Followers! </strong></p><p> So you have a Cool LinkedIn profile and Customers look forward to meeting you.  But let&rsquo;s take a logical step and transform you into a Thought Leader.</p><p> As a Thought Leader; people will seek you out as part of the buying process and ask your advice.  Think about it. Companies will seek you out.  (For the Sales People reading, this means, leads for free!).</p><p> While there are many definitions of what a Thought Leader is or should be.  I&rsquo;m not saying you suddenly need to be the next Brian Solis on the speaker circuit.  But if you sell Human Capital Management (HCM) for example and are posting, publishing, blogging about HCM, I&rsquo;m sure you are going to get spotted by somebody who is thinking about buying some HCM.</p><p> When people want to buy something, the first place they go to search for ideas, will probably be Google.  I can get you on the first page, now wouldn&rsquo;t that be cool?</p><p> <strong>  How Do you Become a Thought Leader? </strong></p><p> This is actually more straight forward than some people think.  I&rsquo;ve made an assumption you are interested in what you do (if not, please don&rsquo;t waste your time reading this).</p><p> You can start by curating content and posting through your Social Media channels.  But, Please don&rsquo;t become a corporate bore, think before you post.  Is the person you want to read your posts really interested in your &ldquo;Jargon, Jargon, my company is great #Meaninglesshashtag&rdquo; posts?  I&rsquo;m not, for sure.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s assume you have seen an interesting PWC white paper.  Why not take a screen shot of one of the Infographics and ask an engaging question.  &ldquo;PWC survey says that 85% of CFOs think XYZ, is this similar for you in your industry?&rdquo;  Attaching the Infographic.</p><p> (If we go back to my point at the start of the blog.  If a prospect and casual observer of your LinkedIn profile, sees your interesting posts they are going to think.  This person knows their stuff, sounds like they know my industry and understands the issues that are keeping me awake.  (They might even contact you &hellip;.)</p><p> As a Pre-Sales person you are given an amazing gift every time your meet a customer or prospect.  Free business advice and consultancy.  The customer will explain their business issues etc.  You will, I assume, take notes and  write these up.  Why not turn them into a blog?  Of course you cannot mention the customer, but you could write a 500 word piece on &ldquo;What Business Issues we are Seeing in the XYZ Market right now and the Business Outcomes our Customers are Obtaining&rdquo;.</p><p> Post this on Twitter, LinkedIn, Googleplus (you did claim your Google Authorship, yes?) and I can assure you, people will seek you out and free leads will come your way.</p><p> <strong>  Conclusion </strong></p><p> There is an old saying in sales that &ldquo;People buy People&rdquo;, this hasn&rsquo;t changed, in fact in the Social world this is more appropriate.</p><p> Assuming you are a Pre-Sales person that wants to be recognised as a Professional in your industry, are interested in what you do and what to win your bonus; you need to wake up to Social Selling</p>",

    "link": "the-evergreen-content-hack-how-to-write-sticky-content-that-will-generate-a-ton-of-traffic",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This post is part of a series on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.keeping.com/growth-hacking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   growth hacking  </a> </u>  (How our startup is growth hacking its way to success&hellip; and how you can copy us!)</p><p> It&rsquo;s astounding just how quickly content moves. Because of this, content marketing can be quite intimidating, and sometimes feel like a waste of time.</p><p> One can be excused for wondering what the point is in creating something so profound, only to attract readers for a brief amount of time, then have it prove irrelevant shortly after.</p><p> Well, luckily all content is not so short-lived. Evergreen content can attract readers for years after it&rsquo;s been published, and still be relevant.   It&rsquo;s not necessary to always create content that&rsquo;s newsworthy, on-trend, or instantly popular: the alternative is for content to be relevant, useful, and sustainable.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll notice that evergreen content has a very subtle approach, much more so than content that&rsquo;s designed to be posted and quickly shared. Because it&rsquo;s more timeless and sustainable, you can use evergreen content to build the foundation for your content strategy, at the same time growing your client base and business.</p><p> <strong>  IN THIS POST YOU&rsquo;LL LEARN: </strong></p><li> what is evergreen content</li><li> how to write it</li><li> and our results with a piece of evergreen content <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  THE DEFINITION OF EVERGREEN CONTENT </strong></p><p> The best way to describe evergreen content is &lsquo;timelessness&rsquo;. Other types of content are usually timely, i.e. they pertain to a current event; or else they&rsquo;re time sensitive, i.e. their relevance only lasts for a specific period of time. Timeless content is useful on launch day and just as useful up to 6 or 18 months down the track. Timeless content is designed to capture as many readers as possible as quickly as possible, resulting in a rush of viewers, which very quickly declines. On the other hand, evergreen content has a much longer life. The goal with evergreen content is to offer a definitive, sustainable resource for readers; meaning that evergreen content will see an initial spike, and readers will gradually increase over time.</p><p> An exemple of evergreen content is this series we wrote:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.keeping.com/growth-hacking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Growth Hacking Experiment  </a> </u>  which included this post.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s Important to Invest in Evergreen Content </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s true that evergreen content will help boost your search results, and this is the general reason given for why evergreen content should be created. However, there are also other very important reasons why investing in evergreen content pieces will ultimately impact on your business&rsquo;s bottom line.</p><p> <strong>  Customer Trust and Loyalty </strong></p><p> Evergreen content should be definitive. Ensure that your readers and customers have no need to search elsewhere for information on this topic. Once your customers understand that the information you provide is rich and valuable, then they&rsquo;ll trust you with their business.</p><p> <strong>  Generating Leads </strong></p><p> Most consumers are happy to purchase from a brand that offers a meaningful and truthful content experience, so once your evergreen content has been published it will continue generating leads for months, perhaps even years. It will continue working for you by promoting your brand to new consumers and providing them with resources.</p><p> <strong>  Brand Authority </strong></p><p> When you offer valuable, definitive content it positions your brand as an industry thought leader. Experts and other brands in your industry will become aware of your brand, which could lead to so much more &ndash; increased sales right through to industry speaking gigs.</p><p> Buffer is the perfect example of a business using evergreen content to grow its brand authority. When Buffer was first founded the owners struggled with brand awareness, so over 800 guest posts were written to try and get Buffer&rsquo;s name front and centre of people in the social media arena. This was a huge success in increasing their industry authority, plus it landed Buffer its first 100,000 customers.</p><p> <strong>  HOW TO WRITE EVERGREEN CONTENT </strong></p><p> Now that we know evergreen content builds your business, how do we go about actually writing evergreen content? To begin with, narrow down your topic, and outline your expectations.</p><p> <strong>  What Does Your Audience Want? </strong></p><p>  If you are going to spend your resources, time, and money on creating a fantastic piece of content, you must ensure you&rsquo;re covering a topic you know your readers will be interested in.   It doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated or really in-depth to determine the topics your audience really wants to read more about, but you should at least sense-check your ideas.</p><li> Ask your readers for feedback in blog comments and blog articles, and also through social media platforms;</li><li> Check your website&rsquo;s analytics to see which content pieces have been the most popular. Perhaps you could expand on these topics?</li><li> Ask your sales department or customer service representatives which questions they are most often asked;</li><li> Have a look at other evergreen content pertaining to your industry. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Do Your Research </strong></p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve narrowed it down and you understand what topics your readers could be interested in, do your research to determine how you might be able to take a new or unique angle on that topic.</p><li> Have a look at what&rsquo;s already been written. What do industry experts advise on this topic? This will give you some idea of what&rsquo;s already &lsquo;out there&rsquo;, plus it will provide you with useful information you can use later.</li><li> Identify information that hasn&rsquo;t been said: your readers want something unique and different &ndash; they don&rsquo;t want to be reading repetitive information. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to create something hugely profound or new; just use a well-covered topic and take a different approach or angle to it. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Narrow Down Your Topic </strong></p><p> Normally evergreen content will cover quite a narrow, specific topic, thus allowing you to be very detailed in your content. It&rsquo;s true that this content should be narrow, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be micro-focused. If you narrow it down too much you won&rsquo;t have enough to write about.</p><p> <strong>  Create Comprehensive Content </strong></p><p> The most defining characteristics of evergreen content are that they&rsquo;re comprehensive, definitive, and exhaustive. Once you&rsquo;ve read an evergreen article you should have no need whatsoever to look anywhere else for further information. Because you know your topic must be definitive it can also help determine just how far to narrow your topic down: if your subject is too broad you&rsquo;ll have to write a lot to make sure it&rsquo;s comprehensive.</p><p> <strong>  Create Timeless Content </strong></p><p> Evergreen content is timeless; therefore it should be as relevant the day it&rsquo;s posted as it is a year down the track. It&rsquo;s important to remember that you should periodically update your evergreen content, although if your content requires frequent updates in order to stay relevant there&rsquo;s a good chance that it&rsquo;s not an evergreen topic.</p><p> Make your evergreen content as timeless as you can, but remember that it will need updating from time to time. By updating any outdated details and changing your old examples for new ones, readers will always find your content relevant.</p><p> <strong>  IN CONCLUSION </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s predicted that content marketing spend will grow at a rate of 10.2% per annum, meaning that opportunities will continue to increase: however it also tells us that the market is becoming more competitive and more crowded. By using evergreen content as part of your content strategy it allows you to create great content that will last longer in what is now a very quick growing market.</p><p> Basically, evergreen content will be of enormous assistance in growing your business by establishing customer trust and loyalty, improving your brand authority, and promoting lead generation.</p><p> After 5 weeks of The Growth Hacking Experiment being online, we generate dozens of signups on a daily basis.</p><p> Want more?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.keeping.com/growth-hacking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   See the rest of The Growth Hacking Experiment  </a> </u></p>",

    "content": "<p> Serving your clients' investment goals has long centered on planning for taxes, retirement and estate matters. However, given the alarming statistics on our youth's level of financial literacy, another box should be added to your checklist: Educating parents on how to raise their children's money management awareness.  Every parent, especially those from affluent families, wants to teach their children how to be good stewards of the family's wealth.  However, it's much easier said than done.  </p><p> <strong>  From an altruistic standpoint, through this effort you will be helping prepare our future generation for adult life. </strong>   The self-serving aspect may be appealing as well since you'll be helping train future clients on the value of financial planning. </p><p> <strong>  A helpful first step to this goal is simply helping parents understand age appropriate lessons for their children. </strong>   From lessons on the value of money to establishing long-term savings goals, parents can teach these concepts through activities incorporated into everyday family life or \"teachable moments.\" An easy example is teaching children the difference between debit and credit cards. On trips to the grocery store, parents can alternate between using cash―demonstrating the actual cost of items― and credit and debit cards―demonstrating the difference in these transactions.</p><p> The other concept to help parents' grasp is that these ideas need to be taught repeatedly.  <strong>  Once is simply not enough. </strong>   Any parent that is still struggling to have their children voluntarily take out the garbage will readily understand this last point!</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  With over 330 million active users globally and a targeted user base of business professionals, LinkedIn is the world&rsquo;s largest professional network. </strong> LinkedIn is no longer just a tool for recruiters, but has evolved into a powerful marketing platform that provides a professional ground for Advisors looking to network. If you don&rsquo;t have a LinkedIn profile, you are missing out on opportunities to connect with clients, prospects and industry professionals.</p><p> Hubspot reports that over 560,000 professionals visit the LinkedIn homepage daily and that 41% of people using LinkedIn for marketing have generated business with it. LinkedIn states that &lsquo;&rsquo;close to 90% of people with assets between $100k-1m turn to social media to help them make important financial decisions.&rsquo;&rsquo; As discussed in our article on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/buyer-journey-advisors-care/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buyer Journey  </a> </u> , people are 60% along in their decision-making process before they decide to engage with a salesperson. This means that there is a very high likelihood that prospects have checked out your profile before deciding to engage with you. Your profile is the first stop that new business contacts are going to use to evaluate you as a businessperson so it is imperative that you are putting your best foot forward.</p><p> Here are 5 easy ways to optimize your LinkedIn profile and enhance your personal branding:</p><p> <strong>  Claim your Vanity URL </strong></p><p> LinkedIn will assign you a random URL with a million confusing numbers. Instead of a URL with meaningless numbers, customize your URL to make yourself more searchable on Google. Your page will become far more optimized from an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-search-engine-optimization-seo-and-why-do-i-need-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Search Engine Optimization  </a> </u>  point of view and also helps your profile to rank higher in Google to make it easier for people to find you. To change your URL, follow these steps:</p><li> Under your profile, choose &lsquo;&rsquo;Edit Profile&rsquo;&rsquo;.</li><li> Next to public profile, you&rsquo;ll see your LinkedIn URL.</li><li> Click &lsquo;&rsquo;Edit&rsquo;&rsquo; to change the URL.</li><li> To the right, in the &lsquo;&rsquo;Your public profile&rsquo;&rsquo; URL dialog box, click &lsquo;&rsquo;Customize your public profile URL&rsquo;&rsquo;.</li><li> Choose a URL that matches your name as closely as possible.</li><li> Click &lsquo;&rsquo;Set Custom URL&rsquo;&rsquo; to save your change. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Upload a Professional Photo </strong></p><p> Upload a photo where you are in a professional setting and dressed appropriately. You want to present a personable and professional image that conveys who you are as a professional.  You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to hire a professional photographer to make a great impression. Your best bet is to upload a smiling photo that communicates professionalism.</p><p> <strong>  Your Headline Matters </strong></p><p> Write a great headline. Your headline is the first thing someone will see about you so make it catchy and attention grabbing. The LinkedIn search provides users with the ability to search using keywords and location to find prospective clients or networking contacts. &lsquo;&rsquo;Financial Advisor&rsquo;&rsquo; should appear in your headline but go beyond just your title and communicate to prospects, in 120 characters, what you do or what makes you different. Your LinkedIn headline is one of the most significant factors that will help your page show up in LinkedIn search results.</p><p> <strong>  LinkedIn Summary </strong></p><p> You have up to 2000 characters to create an engaging LinkedIn summary, which provides an opportunity for you to expand on what you do, your experience, success stories, what makes you different, and your goals and objectives. You can also use the summary section to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/6-seo-pitfalls-to-avoid-during-your-next-website-redesign-part-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   integrate keywords  </a> </u>  that you&rsquo;d like to be ranked for in search engine results.</p><p> <strong>  Update your Status Regularly </strong></p><p> By updating regularly, you are increasing your engagement with your LinkedIn community. By updating regularly, you are also going to show up on news feeds more often, which keeps you relevant and top of mind for your connections. Update your profile with relevant articles, industry updates, blog posts, curated content. or updates about you and your business.</p><p> LinkedIn can be a very powerful marketing tool that should be checked just as often as your email.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  It is okay to take a step backwards in life/work </strong></p><p> In today&rsquo;s ever competitive world for jobs, money, getting ahead, many people would say I am absolutely crazy to mention any possibility of wanting to give up something or take a step backwards to be able to really enjoy life, family, and career. However, I would tell you that sometimes to really get the most fulfillment or center on the right progression, it is okay to step backwards in life/work if you gain personal momentum immediately or down the road.</p><p> For instance, the past ten years have been some of the most tumultuous times for people in the workforce as we have seen many layoffs or instances where people have to do more with less, causing more stress and even more situations of discomfort and unhappiness. <strong>  Because we are living in an ultra competitive time &ndash; meaning I have to find another job with the same title or higher, I have to make the same money or even more &ndash; people are not really taking the opportunity to sit back and understand what they want. </strong> Instead, the focus continues to be how do I get more and more.</p><p> Sure, I get it. We all want more and we believe we can get more. Especially, we you are competing with a generation where parents tell  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/Mickey-goodman/are-we-raising-a-generati_b_1249706.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gen Y folks they can be anything they want to be  </a> </u>  and they believe they can walk out of college being a manager making $70k a year without any real experience, it&rsquo;s hard to compete with.</p><p> However, I am here to offer this piece of advice to you as someone who faced a situation of a layoff and wondering what was next; <strong>  take an opportunity to evaluate your life, work, and what you really want out of it. </strong> Sure, we all have bills to pay, but at what point does money become your sole crutch to enjoy your life?</p><p> Explore all possibilities in the career market. Just because a potential position doesn&rsquo;t have the same or even greater title, does not mean it is not an equivalent role. What if you could take a step back to take two steps forward in a year? Meaning, what if you went from a director role to a manager role for a year, to then be able to move into a global role? Isn&rsquo;t this opportunity greater than if you would have just taken another director role? The same works for money &ndash; although I do understand there are thresholds each of us needs to still function.</p><p> What I want you to really evaluate moving into 2015 and when we get into 2015, is with every decision you have to make or situation you are faced with, can you take a step backwards to take two steps forward in the future to get the most fulfillment?</p><p> <strong>  Happiness doesn&rsquo;t just show up at our door. </strong> We have to position ourselves to be in personal and professional situations that give us happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, embrace each opportunity, take the time for you, compete where it fits for you versus where it fits for everyone else, and understand it is important when you win, not everyone else. If that means taking a step back, it is okay!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.insidesales.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ken Krogue  </u> </a></p><p> Barry Trailer, Jim Dickie, and their company CSO Insights have been the leading sales research firm for 20 years; it&rsquo;s all they do. CSO is the Chief Sales Officer, and that is who tunes in to anything they say. Every year they do four annual research studies that have so much rich data behind them that Barry and Jim have become the sages of the sales industry. Their four research studies, each with key trends analysis are:</p><li> 21st Annual Sales Performance Optimization Study (SPO)</li><li> Sales Management Optimization Study</li><li> Lead Management &amp; Social Engagement Study</li><li> Sales Compensation and Performance Management Study <br/>  </li><p> The Sales Performance Optimization Study is going on as we speak. If you hurry  <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/CSOSurvey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you can still take it  </a> </u>  and get your own copy of what was a 214-page study last year when they wrap it up in the middle of February. I got to spend an hour with Barry on a  <u>  <a href=\"http://youtu.be/tHTs2MZ7wWI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sneak peek webinar  </a> </u>  last week and picked his brain about some of the things the data is showing. Barry is speaking about highlights of last year and forecasting trends again this week in the 1stAnnual Inside Sales Kickoff event that also includes some insightful research from the American Association of Inside Sales Professionals ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aa-isp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AA-ISP  </a> </u> .)</p><p> Bob Perkins and Larry Reeves are the founders of AA-ISP and also contribute annually to the research foundation of the inside sales or remote selling industry. I reached out to them as well as they prepare for their Kickoff and their first full day event on February 12 in San Francisco. I will mention a few things their research has found.</p><p> There is also some great research being done in the Inside Sales space by Dr. James Oldroyd, Vorsight, The Bridge Group, and the Reality Works Group.</p><p> This year Barry warns that both alarming and exciting things are happening.</p><p> Alarming?</p><p> Looking back at last year&rsquo;s study we see some very worrisome trends developing in:</p><li> Quota Attainment</li><li> Revenue Plan</li><li> CRM Usage</li><li> Process Decay</li><li> Forecasting Accuracy <br/>  </li><p> I have a 3 minute video summary here:</p><p> [youtubevid id=&rdquo;gumtncg5z_I&rdquo;]</p><p> <strong>  Quota Attainment: </strong>  Percentage of Reps Making Quota in 2009 &ndash; 2013 is going down.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1_5.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><li> 2009 = 51.8%</li><li> 2010 = 59.4%</li><li> 2011 = 63.0%</li><li> 2012 = 63.0%</li><li> 2013 = 58.2% <br/>  </li><p> The 2009 number was an all time low on the heels of the economic tailspin at the end of 2008. 2013 was the first decline in four years.</p><p> <strong>  Company Sales Plan Attainment: </strong>  Percentage of Revenue Plan Attainment 2009 &ndash; 2013 is also going down.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2_6.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><li> 2009 = 77.9%</li><li> 2010 = 85.9%</li><li> 2011 = 89.0%</li><li> 2012 = 89.2%</li><li> 2013 = 83.9% <br/>  </li><p> The downturn in 2013 was also the first such shift in four years across the 1200+ firms surveyed. <br/> <br/> <strong>  CRM Usage: </strong>  CRM usage is going down for the first time in 15 years. CRM engagement is a leading indicator of the assembly line upon which almost every other sales process and sales application run in the sales industry. Barry thinks we may be taking our eye of the ball. We are missing the blocking and tackling that makes up successful sales. His trend lines and key indicators show that the Great Recession of 2008 was a big wakeup call for companies everywhere and for four straight years sales leaders and teams improved their numbers every year in a row.</p><p> Until 2012&hellip; Then things leveled off and the last two years they are heading back down. He warns we are all becoming complacent, and like the herd mentality, it looks like we are all doing it together. That leaves great opportunity for those who buck the trend and tighten up their CRM usage and sales process.</p><p> <strong>  Sales Forecasting Accuracy: </strong>  Barry warns that sales forecasting is as bad, maybe worse, as it has ever been. I joked with him that in years past we could flip a coin and get as good of odds as the accuracy of the average VP Sales guessing what their team would bring in.</p><p> &ldquo;This year it&rsquo;s worse!&rdquo; Barry laughed. &ldquo;Try just over 45% accuracy. Flipping a coin provides better odds than our best sales guess.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Sales Process:  </strong> One of the most impactful aspects I look forward to in Barry&rsquo;s research study is the CSO Insights Sales Relationship / Process MatrixTM. This is probably the meatiest and most proprietary aspect of the study that compares five levels of relationship a provider has with their customers:</p><li> <strong>  Approved Vendor:  </strong> Legitimate provider but no significant competitive edge.</li><li> <strong>  Preferred Supplier: </strong>  Your marketplace reputation makes you preferred among competitors.</li><li> <strong>  Solutions Consultant: </strong>  Your product, insights, or services place you as a consulting resource.</li><li> <strong>  Strategic Contributor: </strong>  Above and beyond consulting, you are a source of strategic planning resource for broader challenges.</li><li> <strong>  Trusted Partner: </strong>  Your long term contributions&mdash;products, insights, and processes are viewed as key to your client&rsquo;s long-term success. <br/>  </li><p> And the four levels of sales process they employ to leverage their performance:</p><li> <strong>  Random process:  </strong> Your Company may be perceived as anti-process.</li><li> <strong>  Informal process: </strong>  Process is neither monitored nor measured but exists loosely.</li><li> <strong>  Formal process:  </strong> You enforce use of defined sales process with periodic reviews.</li><li> <strong>  Dynamic process: </strong>  You dynamically monitor and receive continuous feedback on your formal process and improve it based on key changes in market conditions. <br/>  </li><p> It highlights 3 levels of performance and looks like this:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3_3.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> Those familiar with the work of Barry and Jim will be familiar with their contention that how you sell can be a sustainable competitive edge. The finding originally arose from the trends they observed year-over-year and was based on research they initially published in HarvardBusiness Review (HBR) in 2006 and then expanded to a paper published in HBR in Europein 2011. The outcome of those analyses was that the level of sales process rigor applied to the marketplace in sales, combined with the level of customer relationship developed with your client base, directly affect sales performance.</p><p> The gray section of the SRP MatrixTM illustrates that if companies are totally random with process, individual sales contributors may reach the status of trusted partner with their own clients, the company as a whole does not get to that level. Here is a backwards glance at the comparison of what happened last year in 2014 between the three levels:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4_2.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> They ask CEOs, which sales organization would you rather have? As investors, which company would you rather own stock in? And as for the Chief Sales Officer, which level of sales organization do you want to lead in 2015?</p><p> They point out that the distinctions that separate these organizations have been consistent over the last seven years and are becoming wider each year. In 2008 the SPO report showed the outcome of forecast deals at Level 2 were 5 points higher than Level 1; today that spread is 9 points. And the range between level 2 and Level 3 firms has increased to 7 full points. Barry warns that the only thing Level 1 companies see are the tail lights of Level 2 and Level 3 companies.</p><p> Process matters!</p><p> And sales process is wholly in your own hands.</p><p> Instead we are taking our eye off the ball and letting our sales processes decay. Again a backwards glance at the three levels show a peak in companies operating at Level 3 and Level 2 in 2012:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/5_2.png\" width=\"1200\"/></p><p> You will have to quickly  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/CSOSurvey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  take the study </a>  by the middle of February to see what happened last year.</p><p> So what areas of 2014 are exciting?</p><p> <strong>  Inside Sales or Telesales: </strong>  This next generation of sales is widening the gap between the tradition model that hasn&rsquo;t adjusted to the virtual sales model defined as professionals sales done remotely model that has been called inside sales. This approach is often now being referred to by enterprise companies like Cisco, whose own Luca Felli and many others coin the phrase Virtual Sales or the Next Generation Sales Model.</p><p> The AA-ISP report their most recent research shows that 52% of companies are increasing headcount this year in their Inside Sales department, while 85% are increasing their training programs.</p><p> The Top Challenges in the Inside Sales arena was looked by the AA-ISP from two perspectives, the individual sales reps, and sales leadership.</p><p> The Top 3 Challenges of frontline sales reps in 2014 were:</p><li> Quality and Quantity of Leads</li><li> Career Development</li><li> Training <br/>  </li><p> The Top 3 Challenges of sales leadership in 2014 were:</p><li> Training</li><li> Recruiting &amp; Hiring</li><li> Lead Quality &amp; Quantity <br/>  </li><p> Traditional field or face-to-face models have already embraced a hybrid design that combines outside and inside or remote sales together as outside reps are spending more and more of their day on the phone and web conferencing resources as buyers have less time and need to meet face-to-face. Barry moves from this SPO study to a special research project around the Telesales initiative in March.</p><p> Social Media Social Media is finally coming of age. Even last year Barry warned it wasn&rsquo;t producing the actual Sales Performance results all the hype and buzz were indicating. No longer. Social selling with social media is finally getting the traction that the trend was indicating. Barry says that there will be more specific data in the third study this year called the Lead Management &amp; Social Engagement Study.</p><p> There is a great article by my Forbes colleague Jayson DeMers called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2014/11/19/the-top-7-social-media-marketing-trends-that-will-dominate-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">   The Top 7 Social Media Marketing Trends That Will Dominate 2015  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  Sales Tools &amp; Technology </strong>  There are more sales tools for  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkrogue/2014/02/27/what-is-sales-acceleration-new-research-highlights-sales-acceleration-tools-technologies-market-size-and-top-sales-acceleration-companies/\">   sales acceleration  </a> </u>  than ever before.

    "content": "<p> It is almost counterintuitive, but the best way to impress others may be to simply engage their curiosity rather than try to give them a lot of info about our accomplishments and ourselves.The reality of human nature is that if you&rsquo;re genuinely curious, you will be interested in the other person. This is obvious and simple, but it may be the secret to getting others to believe that you truly care. And by the way, in this ADD world, being curious about another person is actually unique and can set you apart.Most of the successful businesspeople I interviewed for the book,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118156285/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118156285&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=redzonemarket-20&amp;linkId=62BVEGKUSLXL2OXF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   THE CONNECTORS  </a> </u> , no matter what their position, are curious - genuinely and transparently curious. And listening is their secret weapon. They are curious listeners.It&rsquo;s what a great listener doesn&rsquo;t say that is so powerful. Have you ever been around someone that just wants to listen to you, wants to hear all about your day or your recent trip? Someone who is truly interested in you. Hmmm. I don&rsquo;t think you find them very often. But when you do, they really stick out. The act of listening shows that you care.An example of this is an entrepreneur I have worked with who runs a multi-million dollar data architecture firm. He is so skilled at listening that when I first met him it was almost uncomfortable. He gives such unwavering eye contact and his body position says that he is completely interested in what the other person is sharing. It certainly isn&rsquo;t typical. But since he started his firm when he was 20 years old, he&rsquo;s constantly been engaging in &lsquo;investigative&rsquo; type work to find out more about the other person.This concentrated, curious listening has served him well both personally and professionally. It is his unique ability to completely pay attention to the person he&rsquo;s with that allows him to connect with others on a different level, be memorable and likeable. Ultimately, he credits this skill for helping him generate almost twice the number of sales of most of his competitors in the United States.If you show an interest in listening to what others have to say, it could be easily inferred that you are a good and genuine person and maybe someone they&rsquo;d like to do business with.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Do you have industry experience? </strong></p><p> That's a question we get a lot during prospect/client calls or meetings. I never quite know how to answer it, although it seems appropriate. Not that I am trying to avoid it, but I'm not sure how important industry experience is when it comes to good selling.</p><p> Being a sales expert, I wear my sales hat wherever I go. Whether it's ordering a coffee at Starbucks or any other coffee shop, buying a car, returning an item with an on-line retailer, having an issue with my phone or credit card company. Many of my blogs are inspired by sales experiences and I see mistakes and missed opportunities everywhere, no matter what industry.</p><p> We here at CSA mostly provide sales training to the B2B world, but our philosophy would also sit really well in the B2C environment. If only companies would start to understand that we are all people (regardless if we are buyers on a personal or professional level) and bad selling is bad selling.</p><p> <strong>  Industry experts might focus on the features </strong></p><p> Too many sales people focus on the features and benefits rather than the value and talk themselves out of a sale as a result. The benefits of your product/service is something that your sales manager should be able to train you on. It's important to understand what you are selling and to answer questions if they come up, but it's more important to first connect with the person you are talking to, understanding the underlying philosophy of human interaction and behavior and to then take the next step.</p><p> <strong>  If you understand how people feel, you are able to build trust </strong></p><p> For example, if I have a customer service issue with American Express I want the person on the other end of the phone to first understand why I am upset (should that be the case) and the show empathy. If I lose my card abroad, that's an upsetting experience, but if a sales/service person calms me down, the interaction will be a lot smoother and easier for everybody involved.</p><p> That's a skill that can be trained. <strong>  Proper listening and paying attention to your customer's behavior is a core competency of Consultative Selling. </strong> It's what we train in our program.</p><p> Sometimes I wish that companies would hire us in a field where we have had no previous experience. Why? Because it would help them to gain a insights about their business that they might not be aware of. That's the beauty about outside perspective. It's not tainted and it focuses on the real issues that your company might face, rather than being just as good or better than the competition.</p><p> <strong>  Industry jargon is not brain surgery </strong></p><p> Four years ago we started working with a 3PL/Logistics provider. We were new in that field but it didn't matter. The company was struggling to get back to its pre-recession revenue and we helped them achieve that goal. Our client wasn't looking for a company that had logistics expertise, they were looking for a provider who was a sales expert. This company is still a client of ours, they have grown dramatically as a result of working with us. Have we learned a lot about the logistics industry in the course of the last four years? Of course, but lingo and terminology can be learned quickly, that's not brain surgery.</p><p> Also, every company has a unique set of challenges. Sometimes a technology company has more in common with a market research firm than with another tech outfit. Why, because the way they structure their sales force might be similar, or how they use their CRM system. What's important is to identify the opportunities for growth and to then design the program around it.</p><p> <strong>  What do Ballet, PR and Sales have in common? </strong></p><p> It's the fundamental change in the way people sell, their outlook on prospect and client situations, their attitude and the way they learn how to add value to their clients rather than pushing product features that makes the difference.</p><p> Just look at my professional background. I started out as a professional ballet dancer, became a PR expert and finally ended up in sales. What did I need to be successful in all those disciplines? <strong>  Tenacity, perseverance, respect and professionalism. </strong></p><p> So, the next time you hire a company to help you in an area of improvement, ask yourself the question. <strong>  Do I want somebody who knows my industry, or somebody who is an expert in what they do? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Wonder why your phone isn&rsquo;t ringing off the hook with job offers?</p><p> Or why you aren&rsquo;t getting those interviews for positions that you KNOW you are qualified for?</p><p> Well, here&rsquo;s why, it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re not talented, it&rsquo;s just your resume stinks. The worst part is you may not even realize it. <strong>  Here&rsquo;s why your resume doesn&rsquo;t work. </strong></p><li> It does not represent you. Resume Writing services are not the same as resume writers. Resume Writers take time to interview and talk through the process of updating your credentials. Services ask you to submit a resume and they run it through a process add a bunch of empty adjectives and call it a day &ndash; and that&rsquo;s not good for you. <strong>  You need someone to add a personal touch. </strong> <br/>  </li><li> Outdated! You have skills from the 90&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;re trying to sell abilities and skills that are obsolete in today&rsquo;s ultra-competitive market. <strong>  Technology changes every 3 to 5 years and the workforce changes annually so you&rsquo;ve got to make sure you are among the top talent people. </strong> <br/>  </li><li> Bad format. Your resume is not properly formatted. There are several resume styles but the most popular &ndash; the one that gets the most attention from hiring authorities &ndash; is the reverse chronological order (meaning from most recent to oldest employment). Employers want to see your most recent, relevant skills and accomplishments. <br/>  </li><li> It&rsquo;s not attractive. Yes, like Justin Timberlake you need to bring the sexy back to your resume. I&rsquo;ve seen some terrible stuff &ndash; too many colors &ndash; crazy fonts &ndash; too many fonts &ndash; excess bolding &ndash; long links and pictures. None of those things will get you noticed in the traditional/corporate job market. <br/>  </li><li> It&rsquo;s way too busy. One of the things I look for when updating someone&rsquo;s resume is the wording. Many people try to show off their expansive vocabulary on their resume. They over explain or use complicated words when more simple ones are more effective and will do just fine. Hiring managers don&rsquo;t have time to cut through the layers of belabored words, so they just toss it. Resume are way too long in most cases and need to be streamlined. <br/>  </li><p> Trust me, you are smart, skilled, well-educated, awesome and all that jazz - BUT your resume does not reflect that. Just like everything else in our lives, <strong>  the resume game has changed </strong> &ndash;you probably need some help to make sure your resume doesn&rsquo;t stink.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Every month, 25 million Facebook posts are shared. An astounding 500 million tweets go out each day. If your company&rsquo;s articles, blogs, videos, interactive games, podcasts, or infographics happen to &ldquo;go viral,&rdquo; it can mean thousands of new visitors to your website and a corresponding increase in sales. People love sharing items that are funny, emotional, or opinionated. Not every piece of content can be a hit sensation, but creating share-worthy content is easier than you may think. <strong>  1. Do it better. </strong>  Look for content that has performed well in your industry using  <u>  <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BuzzSumo  </a> </u> . Identify gaps in their content and create your own post that rephrases what you&rsquo;ve read &mdash; and  <a href=\"http://backlinko.com/viral-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  adds more value </a>  to it as well. You can add value by:- Following a logical narrative with an introduction, body, and conclusion- Going into greater detail on points that seemed glossed over and adding research that validates your ideas- Making sure your content has insanely useful data, quotes, tutorials, photos, or whatever it is that your audience is looking for.In addition to BuzzSumo, there are many tools to help you find trending topics.  <u>  Spend some time looking them over </u>  and find a system that feels intuitive and comfortable for you to use on a regular basis. <strong>  2. Use social bookmarks. </strong>  Social bookmarking sites help you gain a large audience quick. Promote your content on sites like Reddit, StumbleUpon, Digg, and Delicious. Don&rsquo;t forget to post in forums that specifically target your industry as well. The new &ldquo;Article Rich Pins&rdquo; on Pinterest are also worth checking out. Be sure to set a time limit to  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.wishpond.com/post/64689796587/the-ultimate-small-business-guide-to-social\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   invest a little effort  </a> </u>  into engaging with others&rsquo; content on the site, so you&rsquo;re not singled out as an evil &ldquo;spammer.&rdquo; <strong>  3. Share content that projects how people want others to see themselves. </strong>  It sounds complicated, but it&rsquo;s an undeniable fact that people post on social media as  <u>  <a href=\"http://socialtriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/viralpresentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   an extension of their personalities  </a> </u> . That&rsquo;s why people love quotes, funny memes, political cartoons, and satirical videos. They want to project their sense of humor, their values, or their interests. Some of the best social posts are ones that ask fans to share photos or stories about how they use the product.  <u>  The NY Times </u>  found that there are several other key reasons why people share content (that are more altruistic and less self-serving):- To bring valuable and entertaining content to others,- To grow and nourish our relationships, and- To get the word out about a cause or brand we care about. <strong>  4. Target a niche.  </strong> It seems logical to think that the broader your appeal, the more people you&rsquo;ll have sharing your content. Yet, that doesn&rsquo;t really work online. Trying to target everyone is like targeting no one. People like to think of themselves as individuals, so it&rsquo;s better to target a more particular niche market. For instance, you might  <a href=\"https://growthhackers.com/articles/step-by-step-for-creating-viral-content-from-0-to-250000-views?r=trending\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   make a joke  </u>    </a> that only people from a certain city would really understand. Think about all those people who share quizzes like &ldquo;Which Star Wars Character Are You?&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t want to simply be known as a Star Wars fan. They want to say something about themselves, too. <strong>  5. Whenever possible, SHOW, don&rsquo;t TELL. </strong>  Sure, Blendtec could say, &ldquo;We have the most powerful blenders in the world &mdash; so powerful, in fact, that they could easily shred an iPad!&rdquo; But it all just sounds like a boring old ad, doesn&rsquo;t it? When they released a video showing the destruction, audiences reveled in the spectacle &mdash; and shared readily! Is it any wonder sales went up 700 percent? A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234801\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   short, well-executed video  </a> </u>  is the preferred medium for many web users who devour content on a regular basis. <strong>  6. Use tools to make content easier. </strong>  We could write a novel on tools for viral-worthy content, but here are a few tips. Everyone loves a good quote, especially if it&rsquo;s accompanied by a visually stunning photo that looks pretty on the page. But who has time to whip something up in Photoshop every time? Instead, try tools like  <u>  <a href=\"http://quotescover.com/#sthash.kQ5BSWRT.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   QuotesCover  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://recitethis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ReciteThis  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://quozio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quozio  </a> </u> . Want to put  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jeffbullas.com/2014/07/25/43-tips-for-creating-viral-content-campaigns-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   scores of useful information  </a> </u>  into a neat infographic, but lack the designer?  <a href=\"http://piktochart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Piktochart  </u>    </a> will help you in a pinch! Need a professional-looking video that is free, quick, and easy to create? We like using  <u>  <a href=\"https://animoto.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Animoto  </a> </u> . <strong>  7. Give it some serious thought. </strong>  Is &ldquo;going viral&rdquo; by getting shares and likes really enough? Or do you want more? Perhaps your company wants to build SEO links, increase social media engagement, increase newsletter sign-ups, or boost sales by X amount. Create specific goals and get a system to look at key performance indicators that will help you measure that success. Ask me about analytic tools that will make this task much easier. Or, if you prefer, I can get you set up and report campaign progress in an easily digestible way.8. Ask the pros.  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mod Girl Marketing  </u>    </a> has been helping companies promote content on social media sites for the better part of a decade.

Great uncertainty remains about where U.S. immigration policy is heading as Congress actively seeks to reverse the president&rsquo;s administrative actions.</p><p> What is clear is that when undocumented immigrants &ndash; farm workers, hotel workers, and household and restaurant staff lacking green cards or other legal status &ndash; do pay into Social Security, they often have little prospect of ever receiving benefits.  In 2010, <strong>  some 3 million such workers with fake or expired Social Security numbers added a $12 billion bonus to the Social Security Trust Fund </strong> , the U.S. Social Security Administration  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   estimated  </a> </u> .</p><p> But a new  <u>  study </u>  of Mexican immigration between 2005 and 2011 shows an abrupt end to what had been steady increases, year after year, in the number of these undocumented workers crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and adding to the Trust Fund.</p><p> In the wake of the Great Recession, the inflow of undocumented workers slowed sharply to about 159,000 new Mexicans migrating and seeking work in 2011, down from a 2007 peak of almost 670,000.  The study was based on Mexican government surveys taken in bus depots, airports, and train stations in northern border cities.</p><p> The upshot, the authors said: &ldquo;The number and dollar value of [new] Social Security contributions that cannot be attributed to a valid identity are also likely to have declined sharply.&rdquo;</p><p> Meanwhile, the flows of documented workers who make numerous trips back and forth across the border increased during the same period.  These immigrants are more likely to one day become eligible to collect Social Security pensions.</p><p> It&rsquo;s impossible to predict how these trends will develop amid a strengthening U.S. job market and divisions over immigration policy.  But as the researchers noted, it&rsquo;s an interesting trend that bears watching.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Mastermind groups are a great way to connect and develop lasting friendships and opportunities that allow you to live the life you want, with the people you want in it. </strong> They come in all shapes and sizes, but not all are created equal and it&rsquo;s important to choose carefully. The one important guideline for any mastermind you belong to is the connection you feel to the individuals in the group, and the levels of respect and trust that develops over time. <br/> <br/> I've facilitated several Masterminds, and the one common denominator is that I liked the people I invited onboard and I took great care in grouping the individuals to insure they would be able to maximize their experience. Choose a mastermind with a facilitator and members who lift you up, who will root for you to win, who inspire you, and who will hold you to a higher standard than you do for yourself, and believe in your ability to make the impossible, possible. These are the people you want to surround yourself with. <br/> <br/> Here&rsquo;re a few tips for choosing the right group and making the most of your Mastermind experience:</p><li> <strong>  Finding common ground is essential. </strong> No point in signing up with for a group with people whom you can&rsquo;t relate to and have nothing in common. Determine the common denominator of the group. Are they entrepreneurs, senior executives, techies, lawyers, or a combination of all these. Knowing the issues and focus of the group is probably more important than what job or profession they are in.</li><li> <strong>  Interview:  </strong> A good facilitator of any Mastermind will conduct an in depth interview to determine if the fit is right for both of you. You need to make sure your objectives for joining are in line with the groups. Is the group founded primarily on business priorities, or is it a combination of both business and personal? Which is more important to you? In my experience, it's frequently a combination of both. They are in fact, inseparable, and it takes a good coach/facilitator to guide people through the tricky stuff. You also want to know the background of the group facilitator and their experience in Masterminds, and be sure to ask for references from past or present participants.</li><li> <strong>  Attitude, attitude, attitude: </strong>  In most groups, it's a give first, get later philosophy. It&rsquo;s an attitude of gratitude for the people who share their most intimate details with you, and who trust you to hold these things sacred within the group. Masterminds are not about WIIFM, but is more about what can I do for you? Give to get is the primary driver. And having commitment to the process as it unfolds is important to building trust, and creating strong bonds between individuals.</li><li> <strong>  Know Thyself: </strong> Most of all, when you are in a new MM group, it's about being YOU. Knowing who you are, what matters to you, what your values are, and what you want in your life. Being genuine and authentic is a process of becoming real with those in the room. For many, that's not easy, but it's a concept that is very important part in your MM group, and in your ability to influence at large.</li>",

Why is it that, while artistic tools have become so advanced and provide artists with the opportunity to become so much more productive, the amount of art and the quality of art produced by artists has dropped so dramatically? What am I talking about?</p><p> <strong>  Here are some interesting statistics from the world of classical music*: </strong></p><li> Johann Sebastian Bach, 300+ years ago, over 1100 known works, 3200+ albums, 57,000+ tracks</li><li> Ludwig Van Beethoven, 200+ years ago, over 650 known works, 2800+ albums, 29,000+ tracks</li><li> Sergei Rachmaninoff, 100+ years ago, over 200 known works, 900+ albums, 6,000+ tracks</li><li> Aaron Copland, less than 100 years ago, over 100 known works, 300+ albums, 1,500+ tracks <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How about from popular music: (approximated) </strong></p><li> The Beatles, from the 60&rsquo;s, 300+ songs recorded, ~109 albums</li><li> U2, from the 80&rsquo;s, 250+ songs recorded, ~26 albums</li><li> REM, from the 90&rsquo;s, 89 songs recorded, ~15 albums</li><li> Death Cab for Cutie, from the 2000&rsquo;s, 31 songs recorded, 7 albums <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How about from the craft of writing: </strong></p><li> Charles Hamilton (1876-1961); &gt; 1200 books</li><li> Isaac Asimov (1920-1992); &gt; 500 books</li><li> Nora Roberts (1950-present) &gt; 200 books</li><li> Stephen King (1947-present); 55 books</li><li> Nicholas Sparks (1965-present); 18 books <br/>  </li><p> On the flip side, it&rsquo;s not that as creators we&rsquo;re actually producing less content. We&rsquo;re not. Twenty years ago there were about 600 web pages. Today, 600 million. There are over 100 million WordPress and Tumblr blogs. Social media including Instagram, Pinterest, SoundCloud and YouTube is alive with millions of contributors.</p><p> So my question is this. Where&rsquo;s the next Beethoven? Have you seen the next Monet? Who would you identify as the next Jane Austen? With all the tools we have, shouldn&rsquo;t we be encountering these people in spades? Or do better tools actually make for worse creativity and less productivity? After all, while our tools keep improving, it does seem like we produce lower quality and less recognized excellence. Shouldn&rsquo;t better tools improve our output? Instead, the opposite has occurred.</p><p> Are we too distracted? With the advent of social media, with the flood of entertainment options, are we simply just too distracted? Does the small and the simple pull us away from developing skills, ideas and creative flow?</p><p> Are our educational institutions simply inept? Do they merely teach us a broad range of perfunctory, homogenized, generic knowledge? As Peter Thiel mentions [1], schools are patterned in one way with uniform periods and class sizes and durations, as if the world&rsquo;s knowledge could be parceled out piecemeal for everyone to master.</p><p> Have we forgotten what excellence really is? As they say, garbage in, garbage out. What do we spend our time observing? Facebook, Twitter? Is &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; a major source of what we see, the landscape of creativity that we view?</p><p> Are we addicted to the immediate? Do we not recognize that a daily commitment to a discipline over years leads to mastery and a skillset that produces excellence? Or are we simply pulled into that immediate, bite-size tidbit of cuteness on YouTube?</p><p> Has amusement replaced discipline? Is our cultural foundation on life support? As Neil Postman put it (in 1987 no less), &ldquo;When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.&rdquo; [2]</p><p> <strong>  The answers to these questions seem fleeting but with the amazing toolset we now have, we should be more creative, not less. </strong> With the access we have to the great works of the past, we should have a much more intimate connection to what it means to produce great works ourselves. Perhaps the key doesn&rsquo;t lie in the tools or in the access; perhaps it lies in our heads and in our hearts. After all, access to greatness is worthless unless we use it. Appreciation and understanding of beauty and art won&rsquo;t happen in our children unless we show them the way.</p><p> But, perhaps you say, look, appreciation for art is good, but it&rsquo;s optional really. We all know the real value, the real future for our children, indeed for us, lies in  <a href=\"http://elearninginfographics.com/the-value-of-stem-education-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  STEM  </a> (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). That&rsquo;s where the money lies, that&rsquo;s where the job security is. Well and good.Not! Not good enough! That&rsquo;s only half of the pie and if that&rsquo;s our focus, if we&rsquo;re stuck completely or almost completely in that realm, we won&rsquo;t produce the stunning value each of us has access to.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t believe that? Let&rsquo;s take the example of perhaps the greatest STEM influence of our time, Albert Einstein. He said &ldquo;The greatest scientists are artists as well.&rdquo; And that wasn&rsquo;t just a pithy quote either. Whenever he felt he had reached a dead-end, whenever he got stuck, he would head to the piano. Inevitably, after a period of time he would get up saying, &ldquo;There, now I&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo; [3] And how exactly did he come up with perhaps the most stunning scientific discovery of our age? As he explained to Shinichi Suzuki, &ldquo;The theory of relativity occurred to me by intuition, and music is the driving force behind this intuition.&rdquo;</p><p> So, what&rsquo;s the answer? How do we tap into this luxurious and rich source of scientific inspiration as well as reignite the world&rsquo;s passion for beauty? Let&rsquo;s equally push for CALM (Creativity, Art, Literature, Music). Let&rsquo;s inspire our children, let&rsquo;s inspire each other to delve into the overflowing wells of creative beauty available to us all. How? Here are some suggestions:</p><p> <strong>  Make creativity a daily habit: </strong>  Playing music, writing, drawing, singing. Find something that you like and give it a slice of time every day. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a big slice but over days, weeks and years, you&rsquo;ll see your talent become substantive, you&rsquo;ll see yourself become a qualified artist.</p><p> <strong>  Find sources with substance:  </strong> You have access to greatness, the entire oeuvre of the creative geniuses of past generations. Immerse yourself in these sources so that you can in some small way reflect their expressions with your own unique talents.</p><p> <strong>  Listen, observe, discuss, write:  </strong> This one is simple really. Allow yourself, allow your brain, the room to hear, to see, to comprehend. Then spend time with like-minded peers talking about the beauty, the passion, the excellence you&rsquo;ve observed. How did it happen, what was special about it, how can you do the same? Finally, (don&rsquo;t skip this step), write down your thoughts. As Thackeray said &ldquo;There are a thousand thoughts lying within a man that he does not know till he takes up a pen to write.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Explore: </strong>  For example, do you love classical music? Not really you say? Actually,  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  you really do </a>  but perhaps, just perhaps, you&rsquo;ve never really tapped into its transformative power. Explore sources of creativity so that your brain can&rsquo;t help but overflow with ideas that inspire you and inspire others.</p><p> <strong>  Change your mind: </strong> I run into people all the time that say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the creative type.&rdquo; Not true. Your entire day is an act of creativity. When you have passion for what you do, you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;creative.&rdquo; The next step is to accept this, embrace it, make it part of your daily life, channel it, and let time work its magic.</p><p> We live during one of the most exciting times in the history of civilization. There&rsquo;s absolutely no reason, none, why our generation doesn&rsquo;t produce a raft of geniuses, why our generation can&rsquo;t be remembered as one of the most prolific in history when it comes to artistry, invention, creativity and innovation.</p><p> <strong>  Will you be one of them? </strong></p><p>  </p><p> * ( <a href=\"http://www.classicalarchives.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.classicalarchives.com/ </a> )</p><p> [1] Thiel, Peter A., and Blake G.

    "content": "<p> You&rsquo;d think that after all our vets have sacrificed for our country that somehow slimy manipulators wouldn&rsquo;t go after them specifically.  But, sadly, vets are prime targets for so called &ldquo;veteran&rsquo;s advocates&rdquo;, whose objective is to get their money.  Here&rsquo;s how they work:</p><p> The objective is to sell vets annuities, which tie up a person&rsquo;s money for years and years.  Annuities of this kind are usually not at all suitable for an aging person.  The seller, a company owned or backed by an insurance company, offers veterans a free lunch &ldquo;educational&rdquo; seminar.  An insurance salesperson is the front for this presentation. They go after elderly residents of retirement homes and assisted-living facilities and convince them that they can get free  Aid and Attendance pension benefits offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p> These benefits do exist, but no one who is wealthy qualifies for them.  The vets at the seminar are persuaded to &ldquo;reposition their assets&rdquo; in order to apply for the benefits.  Unwitting senior veterans are sold annuities so that they can qualify. Of course that generates handsome commissions and profits for the insurance agent and insurance company.</p><p> The insurance companies and their agents selling the annuities go after wealthy seniors in expensive retirement facilities, because people who are truly qualified for Aid and Attendance have no money. They induce the senior to put large amounts of money into an irrevocable trust so they appear poor and can thus apply for free Aid and Attendance. </p><p> The wealthy senior vets who get taken by these scammers would never qualify for Aid and Attendance anyway, as one must be low income and with very limited assets to be eligible.  Buying annuities does not fix that.</p><p> A prominent attorney has now filed a lawsuit against one of these insurance companies and the agent who held himself out as a volunteer for veterans when he was really a salesman. Fraud is alleged in the lawsuit, filed in Riverside County Superior Court in CA. We at  <u>  <a href=\"http://aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com  </a> </u>  hope the case is successful.</p><p> How do these slick salesmen who outright lie to senior vets keep getting away with these schemes?  The annuity sale scams are a problem nationwide.  Victims of financial elder abuse rarely report the abuse. They are elderly, get overwhelmed with the vicious battle the insurance companies will put up to defend their actions and they don&rsquo;t want to do it.</p><p> If you would like to do your part to warn your aging clients or family members about these vet-targeted annuity scams, please send out emails or letters to them and warn them to be alert to the problem.  Get your free sample email or letter form from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com  </a> </u>  by clicking  <u>  <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/aginginvestor.com/whitepapers/scam+out+there+specifically+targeting+senior+veterans+.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HERE  </a> </u> .

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What does brand equity get you?  </strong> Among other things &ndash; happy neighbors!  According to recent reports, when a Starbucks opens nearby your property values rise &ndash; alot.  Before you think this phenomena occurs anytime a multi-national company opens its doors in your vicinity, the research also shows that its better to have  <u>  <a href=\"http://curbed.com/archives/2015/01/29/living-near-starbucks-increases-home-value.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Starbucks than Dunkin Donuts  </a> </u> .</p><p> So first to the details and then to the relevance for all of us who own or strive to improve the businesses with which we work.  In their new book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/zillowtalk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zillow Talk  </a> </u> , the chief economist Stan Humphries and CEO Spencer Rascoff at Zillow report that if you live within a quarter-mile of Starbucks your property value could nearly double.</p><p> Here are the numbers, according to the Zillow data from the last 17 years, homes near a Starbucks increased in value by 96% those farther than a quarter mile from a Starbucks increased 65%. Rascoff and Humpries further note, &ldquo;these properties appreciate at a faster rate than US housing on the whole. Interestingly, they&rsquo;re also recovering much more quickly from the housing bust.&rdquo;</p><p> All is not lost if you live near a Dunkin Donuts location, it&rsquo;s just that homes near Starbucks appreciated 16% more.  While real estate analysts can talk about the impact of Starbucks on gentrification or that Starbucks has more west coast locations than Dunkin Donuts, those debates are beyond my scope.</p><p> <strong>  My message is that great businesses lift up entire communities. </strong></p><p> Rather than selling the notion that profit is the &ldquo;be all end all of business,&rdquo; we should be reminded that we have an opportunity to drive the enterprise value of our companies.  That value goes beyond the profit and loss statement.  It is reflected in the way in which we affect the lives of all we serve.</p><p> If we drive great value, that value will be extended richly into our surrounding community.  What will you do to drive enterprise and community value today?  Let&rsquo;s think purpose not profits&hellip;profits emerge from purposeful activity!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Examine your intent to outcomes ratio and measure your progress towards your goal <strong>  &ldquo;Winners make a habit of manufacturing their own positive expectations in advance of the event.&rdquo;  &mdash;Brian Tracy </strong> How many times have you heard a leader utter these words: <strong>  &ldquo;I have the best of intent&rdquo; </strong> or <strong>  &ldquo;I had the best of intent&rdquo; </strong> ?To be an effective leader, having the best of intent does not matter if it is not followed up by action.  Action that is purposeful.  Action that is aligned to an outcome&hellip;a vision.  Thus,  <strong>  your intent as a leader needs to be measured by your outcomes as a leader.   </strong> They go hand-in-hand.  One with the other.Leaders who have discovered and live  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.emergenetics.com/blog/discovering-your-leadership-values/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   their values  </a> </u> , are in the perfect position to align their values with their intended outcomes&hellip;.their vision.  The key is consistently aligning your intentions as a leader with your desired outcomes.   <strong>  This is what I call your &ldquo;I/O Ratio. </strong> &rdquo;Your &ldquo;I/O Ratio&rdquo; as a leader should be in balance&hellip;it should be equalized&hellip;it should be integrated.  All of your stated intentions should match your outcomes 1-for-1.  Intentions are nothing but empty promises&hellip;void of any trust, credibility or accountability if not tagged with solid goals and outcomes to make your intentions a reality.   It is your leadership vision in action. <strong>  But many of today&rsquo;s leaders get stuck on their intent&hellip;and never move forward to action.  </strong>  These leaders stay in the &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; of their own &ldquo;intention island&rdquo; and have a fear of sailing forward towards a desired action.  Your intent as an effective leader should always have an appended outcome that you paint for your followers.  You need to bring them along.Intentions without aligned outcomes will create missed expectations and an unrealized potential that can discount and dilute your leadership brand and legacy faster than anything else.  The world is full of &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; who pontificate their intentions&hellip;but are short on follow-up.  These leaders have an I/O Ratio that is completely out of balance and will wonder why they are unable to engage with a community of trust and credibility.  Don&rsquo;t let that happen to you. <strong>  But intention is only the first step in effective leadership. </strong>   We can have the desire to do the &ldquo;right thing&rdquo; but unless we act&hellip;unless we take that first step towards the outcomes we want, our intention quickly becomes our island&hellip;which is just a useless piece of barren land surrounded by the deep waters of fear and anxiety .  So do all that you can to swim away from your &ldquo;Intention Island.&rdquo;  And move towards action and results.  Better yet, keep your I/O Ration in check and never get yourself marooned on the island in the first place!Our goals can change. They should change.  Our life changes. Organizations change.  Things happen.  Sometimes expected and many times un-expected.  We need to be able to evolve, to bend, to be flexible.  But we still need to keep our eyes on our targets, our goals, our outcomes.   <strong>  We still need to measure our progress towards our vision, otherwise we will never move off  &ldquo;Intention Island.&rdquo; </strong> Keeping your I/O Ration in balance enables you to keep track of your progress towards your desired end results, no matter the detours our lives may take.  As you find your VOICE as a Leader, charting your outcomes aligned to your values is critical in moving from intent to action.  Build your bridge&hellip;learn to swim&hellip;float on a raft&hellip;but don&rsquo;t stay marooned on Intention Island like other leaders!By integrating the  <u>  Emergenetics Profile </u>  into my executive coaching practice, I am able to guide leaders into greater insight and awareness of what is important to them in their life, and, thus, how creating their vision with aligned outcomes impact their leadership brand and create the vision they desire.Finding your V-O-I-C-E as a leader means discovering your core Values;  <strong>  creating a compelling Vision to obtain the Outcomes you want; building relationships with Influence and credibility; making decisions that use your Courage to stand alone; and communicating your overall Expression for lasting impact. </strong> Finding your VOICE as a leader does not mean shouting to make an impact&hellip;it means using the  <u>  Emergenetics Profile </u>  to reveal your brilliance as a leader by:</p><li> Discovering your critical leadership Values</li><li> Creating a compelling vision to obtain the Outcomes you want</li><li> Influencing your relationships with trust and credibility</li><li> Making decisions that reveal your Courage and confidence to take a stand</li><li> Communicating your overall Expression for lasting impact.</li><strong> &ldquo;Where there is no vision, there is no hope.&rdquo;  &mdash;George Washington Carver</strong>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  As a matter of principle, I have always subscribed to the notion that nice guys don&rsquo;t have to finish last. </strong> In fact, they can and should finish first. This ideal has been challenged repeatedly throughout my career, but now that I&rsquo;m running my own business I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that helping the good guys be more successful is the best possible application of my time and talent.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Slate Magazine   </a>  </u> </strong>  published an article titled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/psychology_of_management/2014/05/adam_grant_s_give_and_take_a_theory_that_says_generous_people_do_better.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nice Guys Finish First  </a> </u> &rdquo; by Seth Stevenson featuring the work of organizational psychologist and Wharton Professor, Adam Grant. Mr. Grant has published a book, &ldquo;Give and Take&rdquo; in which he identifies Givers (the good guys), Takers (aggressively self-serving) and Matchers (most of us).</p><p> Mr. Grant has observed that the Givers are abundantly generous with no expectation of reciprocity. They give expecting nothing in return. He also notes that the givers who protect their interests &ndash; who don&rsquo;t allow themselves to be exploited &ndash; are likely to excel in organizations. In my experience (and ideal world) they also excel in business.</p><p> Givers, and the organizations they lead, are perfectly suited to modern marketing strategies. Because they focus on making the people around them better and more successful, their companies are more customer-focused. Because they place their customers&rsquo; interests above their own, Givers are better positioned to conduct the honest dialog that is so crucial to branding and marketing today.</p><p> David Packard once said, <strong>  &ldquo;Marketing is too important to be left to the Marketing Department&rdquo; </strong> . I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Packard was dissing the marketing department. He just understood that marketing is too big for any single person or group. Everyone has to be engaged in the important work of creating value and building a brand.</p><p> <strong>  Marketing today is a very big picture indeed. </strong> And what gets me really excited about the work I&rsquo;m doing these days is this: the people I&rsquo;m working with think so too! They are good guys who care about their products and services. They care about their employees. And they REALLY care about their customers. That, to me, is what business and marketing is all about.</p><p> <strong>  I have my own observations about the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; I have worked with and watched over the years. </strong> These are women and men, founders, executives and managers who are never happier than when everyone around them is challenged and successful.</p><li> Good guys are never, ever done. Whether I&rsquo;m working with the founder of a startup or an executive at a well-established firm, these leaders always want to do more and be better. They recognize that earning their customers trust and loyalty is an ongoing imperative, and they take that challenge very, very </li><li> seriously.</li><li> Good guys want their people and companies to be the best. Most of the good guy leaders I have worked with have studied their competition enough to know if they have some catching up to do. But for the most part, they&rsquo;re motivated by an unquenchable desire for self and organizational improvement.</li><li> Good guys stay sharp. These men and women are almost all voracious readers, and a lot of what they read is directly or indirectly related to their work. They read about marketing and leadership. They study evolving management practices. They&rsquo;re fascinated by emerging technology and all the possibilities it promises for improved service and efficiency. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;m working with a founder now, Jack, who exemplifies these traits. </strong> Jack left the security of a full time gig at a major company about thirty years ago because he saw a void in the marketplace. At the time, the segment of the population he serves had a very poor menu of options. As a result, people were often forced to choose financial solutions that were inadequate to their circumstances.</p><p> <strong>  Jack rushed to fill that void. </strong> Through self-directed education and hard work, he became a nationally recognized authority in a discipline he essentially created. He founded an organization for the practice and served as its first president.</p><p> Benefiting the industry at large, and by extension thousands of people he could never hope to serve, Jack also contributed to the development of an accredited professional training curriculum and designation. To top it all off, he lobbied at the state and federal level and served as an expert court witness to protect the interests of the people his business was built to serve.</p><p> <strong>  This was all in addition to his day job. </strong></p><p> I spoke with some of Jack&rsquo;s colleagues to get a broader perspective on the business. To each of these accomplished individuals, Jack was and is the embodiment of the firm&rsquo;s culture, character and brand. He is the company&rsquo;s most enthusiastic evangelist and its single largest revenue producer. Significantly, their high regard for Jack is only exceeded by Jack&rsquo;s regard for them.</p><p> Mostly, Jack is passionate (an overused term I hesitate to use, but appropriate here) about the people he serves &ndash; a community whose lives his company is in a position to change in profound ways. Jack is a business &ldquo;good guy&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s a privilege (and a blast!) for me to work with Jack and business leaders like him. </strong> I benefit from their wisdom. Their zeal inspires and excites me. Together, we approach marketing from a big picture perspective, working to build brands and grow businesses around true stories that really matter. That&rsquo;s a world where, I believe, good guys are destined to finish first.</p><p> Have you ever worked for or with good guys? How did their presence affect you and your organization? Do you agree with my premise &ndash; that modern marketing is well suited to supporting the success of good guys? Let me know what you think. I&rsquo;d love to hear from you. If you like this, or any of my articles I hope you&rsquo;ll share them. Thanks as always for reading ~ Michael </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What You Need to Know </strong></p><p> Advertising for RIAs is obviously a highly-regulated activity, so it makes sense that it ranks among the most common compliance deficiency for advisors.  <br/> <br/> When regulating advisor advertising, regulators focus first on disclosures, rather than methodology. While offering little guidance on how to do certain things, they do heavily regulate the disclosures displayed on advertisements. Certain advertisements may be &ldquo;compliant&rdquo; per se, however, the omission of proper disclaimers results in a false or misleading message.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Beyond disclosures, regulators tend to focus on certain areas of advertising, including: </strong></p><li> Testimonials</li><li> Social Media</li><li> Past Specific Recommendations</li><li> Recordkeeping/Approval Process</li><li> Performance-based Advertising</li><p> For a complete overview of the \"Advertising Rule\" for RIAs, click  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.advisorassist.com/2013/08/cco-series-advertising.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Why You Should Care </strong></p><p> The ability to confidently and efficiently advertise your services can be of great benefit in growing your firm. With that said, inaccurate or misleading public-facing content can destroy a firm&rsquo;s reputation quickly. <br/> <br/> Unlike brokers overseen by FINRA, the SEC and state regulators are not responsible for reviewing or approving an RIA&rsquo;s advertisements prior to use. The responsibility is placed on your firm and your CCO to ensure that all advertisements are compliant with regulations.  <br/> <br/> With social media becoming an increasingly important advertising channel, it is important to treat this activity with the same care as you would traditional mediums. Because of it&rsquo;s ease of use, however maintaining control and oversight of social media activity brings a unique set of challenges.  <br/> <br/> We cover social media compliance in more detail  <u>  <a href=\"/compliance/social-media-compliance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in a previous post  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Our Recommendations </strong></p><p> To ensure that your firm is keeping up with regulatory requirements and industry best practices in this area:</p><li> Ensure you have a review process in place to analyze firm advertisements for compliance.</li><li> Check your advertisements for proper disclosures.</li><li> Coordinate a process with your IARs to review new advertisements and obtain copies for Books and Records requirements.</li><li> Review seminar presentation content for appropriate regulatory disclosures and compliance.</li><li> Perform checks on your performance calculations to validate accuracy before use.</li><li> Understand your firm's social media presence and ensure you and your employees are not directly or indirectly interacting with the public in a way that runs afoul with the Advertising Rule.</li>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When we started this series of bullets, we agreed with the Federal Reserve that the U.S. economy as a whole will benefit from lower crude oil prices. Specific to municipal credits, the winners from lower oil prices may be sales taxes, big states like California and Texas, and potentially highway user trust fund revenues. First and foremost, more cash in the consumers&rsquo; pockets will likely benefit local economies by spurring consumption. States with sales tax revenues, like California and Texas, will benefit from more consumption activity. Another potential beneficiary of lower crude oil prices are highway user trust funds, which generally apply a unit charge to each gallon of gasoline consumed.</p><p> Citigroup&rsquo;s Municipal Research Team argues that highway user trust funds will benefit from lower oil prices because more people will hit the road and thus increase vehicle miles driven. At the margin this may hold true, but more energy efficient cars, baby boomers retiring and commuting less for work, adoption of alternative motor vehicle fuels such as electricity and biofuels and a preference by younger people to live in urban centers near mass transit options are contributory factors reducing the vehicle miles driven. Therefore we see lower oil prices only as a marginal benefit to highway and road funding.</p><p> <strong>  So why will California, the third largest crude oil producer, and Texas, the largest oil producer, benefit from lower oil prices? </strong> The answer may surprise some of you. Though California produces a lot of oil, other parts of its economy are more important. The majority (54% as of 2013) of California&rsquo;s real GDP comes from finance activities, professional services, manufacturing and information industries. As you can see from the table below, oil and gas extraction represents less than one percent of real state GDP. Furthermore, California&rsquo;s general fund is mainly supported by income, sales and corporate taxes. Oil and gas are not a material component of the California economy or government finances. Can this be true of Texas too?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"132\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-21-at-9.08.39-AM.png\" width=\"605\"/></p><p> Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis</p><p> The Texas state economy is very well balanced. No industry is more than 15% of the State&rsquo;s real GDP (see bar chart). Yes, oil and gas account for 11% (2013) of the GDP, but this is down from 12% in 1997 and is nowhere near as important to the state&rsquo;s economy as for Alaska or North Dakota. Recall from the first installment of &ldquo;Falling Crude Oil and Muni Credit&rdquo; that the breakeven price on Texas crude is between $50 and $60bbl. Now that crude oil has broken through this level, what are some of the secondary impacts? Well, this past week U.S. Steel announced layoffs &ndash; starting in March &ndash; for its Ohio and Texas plants. Some manufacturing jobs will likely be cut as a result of less extraction activity, but drilling down into the U.S. BEA data we see that manufacturing activity in Texas is roughly evenly split between the nondurable goods (7.8%) and the durable goods segment (7.0%). In fact, Texas manufactures more computers than metal pipes. From a state finance perspective, oil and gas royalties are only 2.5% of Texas general fund revenues. In addition, most of SNWAM&rsquo;s credit exposure is wrapped by the Texas Permanent School Fund (PSF). The PSF is a permanent and perpetual fund used to insure the debt of public schools. The credit strength of the fund is significant. In cases where we do not own PSF wrapped debt, our credits are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Texas, which are even less leveraged to oil and gas activity than the rest of the state. So even if the turmoil in the crude oil markets spills over to the Texas economy, our credit selections are insured and strong.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/muni.png\" width=\"585\"/></p><p> Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis</p><p> Sources: SNWAM Research, U.S. BEA, U.S EIA</p>",

    "link": "the-roi-game",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Probably the most overused and perhaps overrated term in business is &ldquo;ROI&rdquo; better known as &ldquo;return on investment&rdquo;. </strong> The concept of ROI was built upon the premise that businesses could have an expectation of seeing gains and/or being made whole as a result of investing in a program, initiative, product etc. The operative word here is &ldquo;investing&rdquo;. When you invest in the stock market, you understand there are risks as well as potential for gains. You also understand some portfolios are riskier than others, but sometimes the more risk you incur upfront- the better your profits. Losses whether small or substantial usually result in feelings of anger and a dose of queasiness- nevertheless, those that invest would have it no other way-because they understand that you have to be in it to win it.</p><p> <strong>  You get what you give. </strong></p><p> In addition, those that invest also know that you get from your investments what you put in. If you choose the right financial advisor, stocks, and remain consistent in your investment- you stand to make profits and prosper.  Likewise, when you put the same efforts, resources and investments in your business and your employees you are likely to see a return on your investment for your efforts.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a shame that we don&rsquo;t see how this formula works in other areas of business. We all know how it is. You want to purchase a new ATS because the one you have isn&rsquo;t cutting it- your leadership wants to know &ldquo;what is the ROI?&rdquo; You want to implement a social media strategy for recruiting- again you will be asked somewhere down the line- &ldquo;what is our ROI for utilizing social media for recruitment?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s understandable to want to see a return on your investments. However, you have to be realistic.</p><p> <strong>  You have to ask yourself? </strong></p><p> Am I whole-heartedly investing in this program and my people beyond just financially? Is your strategy sound and built upon reasonable forecasting of outcomes and risks?</p><p> If you are at a loss in answering these questions fully- you cannot have an expectation for ROI.</p><p> <strong>  Here are some examples of how ROI expectations can be unrealistic: </strong></p><li> Your recruitment strategies are lackluster and built on hiring bodies vs. hiring a few quality individuals- you are not poised to receive a return on your investment of recruitment hours, advertising, interviewing hours, orientation time etc. </li><li> Likewise, if you invest money and resources into a matrixed HR function and do not supply adequate support to the business partners piloting the program- you are likely to strain the program and all allocated resources before it begins to do any good for the organization.</li><li> You purchase that new ATS, but fail to put in place an adequate implementation team and supporting members to ensure the project is a success. <br/>  </li><p> These are some examples of decisions we make in business and HR that are not poised for ROI, because either you have made a poor investment or you haven&rsquo;t set your strategies up for success. Stop using ROI as a term of entitlement. You aren&rsquo;t promised anything even when you have taken the necessary steps to invest properly. Your probability of success drops even further when you make poor investments or no investments at all.</p><p> <strong>  Measure for ROI when: </strong></p><li> You have thoroughly assessed and understand the risks and potential gains involved in your investment.</li><li> Adequate financial backing has been allocated.</li><li> You have done everything in your power to make it a success. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Any practices outside of these elements will result in no return. </strong> Just like with most things in life- you cannot expect something for nothing.</p>",

    "content": "<p> You don&rsquo;t need to convince business owners, executives or professionals about the importance of their business networks. They get it. <strong>  Who you know often trumps what you know in terms of creating real business opportunities and advantages. </strong></p><p> Yet, many of these same professionals often overlook online social networking and fail to take advantage of the huge opportunity it represents to grow and nurture their business networks and relationships.</p><p> <strong>  There are many reasons for this, but here are three big ones: </strong></p><li> Time limitations &ndash; social networking takes time that many of these business leaders don&rsquo;t have and won&rsquo;t make;</li><li> Lack of skill &ndash; business professionals know how to have relationships, but not necessarily in the setting of online social networks;</li><li> Lack of awareness &ndash; busy people who don&rsquo;t know how to have relationships online adds up to a lack of awareness of what is even possible through social networking. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Then, there&rsquo;s the marketing problem. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Social networks aren&rsquo;t that great for brand marketers </strong></p><p> It turns out that social networks aren&rsquo;t that great for brand marketing &ndash; for most types of businesses.</p><p> In his excellent piece  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.experiencetheblog.com/2014/10/stop-social-media-marketing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stop Social Media Marketing  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/augieray\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Augie Ray  </a> </u>  points to a number of studies showing that social media brand marketing (defined as pure earned media, excluding advertising in social networks) doesn&rsquo;t measure up in terms of building trust, acquiring prospects or driving purchases when compared with other marketing channels.</p><p> Ray suggests there are other, more effective opportunities for leveraging social media, such as public relations, corporate communications, product development and customer service.</p><p> <strong>  Social networks are fueled by social capital </strong></p><p> Anyone with experience in social networks knows that effective social networking isn&rsquo;t about marketing and shouldn&rsquo;t be reduced to it.</p><p> Social networking &ndash; for business owners, executives or professionals &ndash; should instead be about communicating and building relationships with the goal of accumulating social capital.</p><p> Building social capital is more akin to investing for long-term accumulation than for short-term profits. It requires the investment of value (your time and insight) without the expectation of any immediate return.</p><p> Building social capital online should be a slam dunk for ANYONE who is the primary driver of their business.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/social-capital-venn.jpg\" width=\"720\"/></p><p> As much as financial and human capital, social capital is necessary for your success in business and arguably the most important measure of the value of social networking. In fact, one study suggests as much as 33 percent of the variance in sales performance can be attributed to one&rsquo;s social capital. (For a great discussion of social capital and an inspiration for this post, see  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscancialosi/2014/09/22/4-reasons-social-capital-trumps-all/\" target=\"_blank\">   4 Reasons Social Capital Trumps All  </a> </u> .)</p><p> Here are three additional ways that building social capital can fuel your business success:</p><p> <strong>  1. Social capital establishes leadership </strong></p><p> Investing in people, sharing your knowledge and helping others establishes you as a leader within your network. Everyone wants to do business with a leader. Whether you&rsquo;re hiring an executive, or choosing a firm or a professional advisor to do business with, people want to work with a recognized leader in their field. That&rsquo;s because leadership within your industry and professional network acts as a form of social proof.</p><p> How to establish leadership in social networks?</p><li> Find and share great content in your field of expertise.</li><li> Participate in topical discussions and always add value and maintain respectful discourse.</li><li> Invest time in writing and sharing your professional insights. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Social capital fosters reciprocity </strong></p><p> Humans are hard-wired to reciprocate. If I invite you to lunch and pay, you want to return the favour. It&rsquo;s partly about fairness, but also about a feeling that we owe something to the person who has given without asking. Giving value of any kind, whether it&rsquo;s your time or knowledge or help, without compensation fosters a sense of fairness and reciprocity among the people in your network.</p><p> How to foster reciprocity in social networks?</p><li> Give not only money, but also your time, to the community.</li><li> Help people whenever you can by answering questions and pointing people in the right direction.</li><li> Adopt a &ldquo;pay it forward&rdquo; mentality in your social networking engagement. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3. Social capital strengthens internal teams </strong></p><p> Leadership and a strong sense of reciprocity aren&rsquo;t just drivers for your external relationships &ndash; they also contribute to building your internal team. Maintaining strong, honest and mutually beneficial relationships within your organization is just as important.</p><p> How to strengthen your internal teams in social networks?</p><li> Pay attention to and engage team members that are active in social networks.</li><li> Look for opportunities to share colleagues&rsquo; content.</li><li> Lead by example. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Stop thinking about social networks in term of marketing and instead focus on deepening relationships, developing thought leadership and growing your social capital. </strong> You will find you get a lot more from your investment.</p>",

    "title": "Forget #FinTech - Welcome to the ValueWeb",
    "link": "forget-fintech-welcome-to-the-valueweb",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "As mentioned <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/02/the-most-likely-future-for-cryptocurrencies.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  earlier in the week </a></u>, we are now in the Net 6.0 phase of life, where we are digitising money.  We digitised commerce some time ago and now eBay, TripAdvisor, Amazon, Alibaba, Kayak and more rule the world.  These are both intermediaries and infomediaries for commerce, but the bit they were lacking is a digital currency.We are now seeing that digital currency emerge to enable the ValueWeb: an internet where value can be exchanged anywhere, anytime by anyone.It is for this reason that we are seeing so much investment in FinTech, with Finovate noting that 12 FinTech start-ups raised $240 million just <u> <a href=\"http://linkis.com/finovate.com/2015/02/IJiOW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this week alone </a></u>.  But this is not about FinTech; it&rsquo;s about value exchange.In fact banking and insurance is finished, as it&rsquo;s now merged with tech to form fintech, but the term FinTech is misleading.  FinTech is just an easy term to merge finance with technology, but that is not what is happening in reality.  We are not just merging finance with technology, but reinventing finance through technology.The ValueWeb treats many things as having value for example, not just finance.  The ValueWeb allows PewDiePie to create YouTube videos that monetise Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg $4 million a year in advertising revenue.  The ValueWeb allows anyone to become a mainstream media channel on a 1:1 basis.The ValueWeb lets shares, favourites and likes to be monetized in the same way, which is why Fidor Bank changed interest rates based upon the number of <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/04/-theres-a-big-difference-between-kyc-and-knowing-your-customer.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Likes </a></u> of their Facebook Page.  It is why they gain thousands of page views for no cost, and why they can spend just &euro;100,000 a year on marketing.The ValueWeb sees gaming as a big source of revenue, and is why World of Warcraft Gold and Call of Duty shortcuts as being big time sources of value.,In other words the ValueWeb innately accepts that anything seen to be of interest by anyone can be monetized.  It is why <u> <a href=\"http://www.icow.co.ke/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=6:icow-soko&amp;Itemid=13\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  goat herders </a></u> in the Kalahari Desert can now be global merchants using a text message and an Instagram account.  It is why one of the biggest selling pop artists in Japan, Hatsune Miku, is just a hologram and how Gangnam Style can go global in an instant.Shares, likes, favourites are the measures for the ValueWeb, alongside dollars, euros and yen.  Inextricably, these things are being drawn together in a new form of global digital exchange.  A value ecosystem comprising value exchanges, value stores and value management systems.  These are the systems replacing banking and insurance and, over time, fintech.  It is not a fintech world we are creating but a value world.Now, the currency of the ValueWeb is still to be defined.  Will it be bitcoin or another cryptocurrency?  We are yet to see.  Will it be a decentralised exchange system controlled by the participants or a centralised structure managed through government licence?  We are yet to see.Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s different to anything that&rsquo;s gone before and as we digitise money and value, we see a brave new world appearing that is very different to the old world.  What this means for our current value stores &ndash; banks &ndash; is that they need to think different.  Today, my value store needs to enable me to store more than just money.  I want to store the things I value which might be documents, photographs, presentations, videos &hellip; anything.In other words, as I&rsquo;ve said before, banks become <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2013/03/banks-are-just-data-vaults.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  data vaults </a></u>, and store the things I see as having value in a physical and digital form.  If banks don&rsquo;t do this, others will and are.  Currently, cloud based services are my digital value stores and if Google, Amazon or Microsoft said I could store my account details and monetary assets in my cloud bank, maybe I would.  Isn&rsquo;t that what Apple is doing with Apple Pay?So &hellip; banks needs to step up to the challenge of the ValueWeb pretty fast if they are still to be relevant in a decade or so.  Meanwhile, we are not living in a FinTech world or FinTech bubble; we are just creating a new world of value in a ValueWeb ecosystem.",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you had asked me 13 years ago if I'd ever become an entrepreneur, I would have laughed and admitted that I didn't really know what that word meant. One year later - 12 years ago this week, in fact - MAP Inc. became an official business. Sometimes you just don't know where your path will lead!</p><p> I have thoroughly enjoyed this meaningful work for a dozen years now and am thankful beyond measure to make a difference doing what I love. And while I definitely love celebrating the wins, the years haven't been all \"puppies and rainbows\"! :) </p><p> Today I offer 12 of the approximately zillion lessons I have learned along the way. I am embarrassed by some of them, but if I help shorten your learning curve - or at least make you feel less alone in your own career path - sharing will be worth it!</p><p> <strong>  12 Things I Know Now That I Didn't Know Then! </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Reach out for help. </strong>  I carried the mindset of, \"I am capable; I should be able to figure this out for myself\" for far too long. Now I reach out much more quickly for help, advice, or even just a shoulder to lean on.</p><p> <strong>  2. Let go of \"shoulds.\"  </strong> I held back in several areas because of what I thought a professional, PhD, business owner \"should\" (or should not) do. Now I have basically removed the word \"should\" from my vocabulary and listen to my authenticity instead.</p><p> <strong>  3. Attend inspiring events. </strong> I waited to attend big, motivating events because I felt I couldn't afford them - or perhaps didn't yet deserve them. When I finally attended one, with a significant price tag and that took me out of state for several days, it changed my entire business model and resulted in a breakthrough leap in revenue that year, too. Now I know the difference between investment and expense. </p><p> <strong>  4. Hire a coach. </strong> This one act has transformed my business more than words can express. Coaching is definitely another example of an investment - sometimes so steep it makes me gasp when I write the check - but it's my #1 professional development support and now I always have a coach!</p><p> <strong>  5. Outsource. </strong> A wise mentor told me early on, \"Do what you do best and outsource the rest.\" I did that immediately in a couple of areas (e.g., accounting and website development) but held on too long to some other less-than-shining areas. Letting go of (presumed) control is difficult, but so liberating!</p><p> <strong>  6. Ask stupid questions. </strong> I know, there's no such thing, right? I bit my tongue too often rather than admitting I felt clueless. Now I ask questions constantly and have discovered that, almost always, someone else has the same question. Or at least they make me feel better by telling me so. :-)</p><p> <strong>  7. Say No. </strong> If I had to do it over, I would say No sooner to un-purposeful requests on my time or opportunities that didn't truly match my strengths, values, and gifts. Now, I often call to mind Kate Winslet's sentiment: \"I wouldn't dream of working on something that didn't make my gut rumble and my heart want to explode.\"</p><p> <strong>  8. Say Yes.  </strong> On the flip side, I would say Yes sooner to scary but exciting (and healthy) opportunities, to my gut, and to delight. Fortunately I gained excellent schooling in this with last year's  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/Blog/tabid/152/post/what-if-you-said-yes/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  42 Days Of Yes </a>  project and have changed my ways considerably!</p><p> <strong>  9. Join a Mastermind group. </strong> For a long time, I actually didn't know these existed, but once I joined I wondered how I managed without for so long. People focused intently on solving my challenges and helping me and my business grow, and for whom I can do the same in return - what's not to love?</p><p> <strong>  10. Trust myself. </strong> I suppose much of this comes with experience, but I sure doubted myself waaaaaay too much. I still have overthinking and self-questioning tendencies but I catch myself more quickly and have strategies for moving past them (see #1, #4, and #9 specifically!).</p><p> <strong>  11. Stop reinventing the wheel. </strong> Creativity is one of my values and strengths, so starting something from scratch excites me. I've learned the value in building on what works, however, and in how repurposing can serve more people and make a stronger impact.</p><p> <strong>  12. Lighten up. </strong> In an effort to be taken seriously, I became...well, serious. In some cases, really serious. Once I let my authentic personality (which is often ridiculously nonsensical) into my work, everything became a lot more joyful - and led to better business results, too.   </p><p> I definitely don't know it all and have learned a ton by trial and error. (At times, I wish I could have learned a little less this way...) ;-) But I am all about growth, so if lessons from my 12 years of business ownership help you become a better business owner or professional, feel free to learn from my experience!</p>",

My F-word is naughty only because of how it impacts business, not because it&rsquo;s used in rap songs and R-rated movies. My F-word (and I&rsquo;ll only say it once) is FREELANCE.</p><p> When I lost my agency job in 2008, I went &ldquo;f***lance&rdquo; while scanning the Portland, Oregon scene for designer gigs. When people would ask what I was did for a living, I would answer, &ldquo;F***lancing.&rdquo; Their response? &ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re unemployed.&rdquo;</p><p> Truth of the matter was, yes, I was unemployed at the time.</p><p> But that time didn&rsquo;t last long. I interviewed with several studios and when nothing came of it I chose to run my own studio over going back to work for someone else. That was the day my f***lancing life ceased and my self-employed life began. The distinction is important.</p><p> <b>  As a f***lance designer: </b> <br/> I was in-between things, grazing until something better came along. <br/> I took whatever work people gave me. <br/> I made money, but didn&rsquo;t have a business account. <br/> I was seen as someone who could fill-in, but wasn&rsquo;t capable of big projects. <br/> I had to cut my rates when working with agencies because they had to have room to markup my fees. <br/> I didn&rsquo;t have control over timelines. <br/> I signed the back of the checks.</p><p> <b>  As a self-employed designer: </b> <br/> I am permanent. I am the something better. <br/> I go out and find the work myself. <br/> I make money and have several business accounts. <br/> I take on big jobs and teammates to do them with me. <br/> I have no middleman and can charge what should be charged. <br/> I establish timelines. <br/> I sign the front of the checks.</p><p> The distinction between the two camps is almost as much a mind-set as it is a technicality; I hope that&rsquo;s clear.</p><p> A designer-friend of mine, <u>  <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/walkingstickdesign\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Clint Walkingstick  </a> </u> , has a similar take on the F-word. Here&rsquo;s what he had to say in an article he wrote called <i>  Freelancing Ain&rsquo;t Free </i> :</p><p> The word freelance carries with it negative connotations that fail to capture the professionalism of the design profession.</p><p> When folks hear &lsquo;freelancer&rsquo; they think: <br/> &bull; not serious <br/> &bull; part-time <br/> &bull; from home <br/> &bull; not professional <br/> &bull; not confident in abilities <br/> &bull; new to the biz <br/> &bull; untrained <br/> &bull; cheap <br/> &bull; student <br/> &bull; poor quality <br/> &bull; not knowledgeable <br/> &bull; house slippers <br/> &bull; unreliable</p><p> If you&rsquo;re an independent designer, you are a small business owner. So, refer to yourself as one and never use the word &lsquo;freelance&rsquo; to describe yourself or your business ever again.</p><p> Amen, Clint. <i>    </i></p><p> <b>  If you&rsquo;re a self-employed designer, don&rsquo;t use the F-word.

    "title": "Creating a Virtual Workforce",
    "link": "creating-a-virtual-workforce",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> By now we are all very much aware that we live in an era of seemingly endless technological advances.</strong>Yes, this means we are constantly glued to our mobile devices and are never truly out of reach, but from a business standpoint, the technology in recent years hasn&rsquo;t just opened new doors &mdash; it&rsquo;s kicked them down, allowing for influx of the greatest minds from around the world. The big question is, are those expert at your company&rsquo;s door?Dynamic, reliable technology in the workplace has given rise to the concept of hiring virtual teams for projects and even entire departments when the tasks at hand don&rsquo;t require in-person interactions. Not only do virtual teams provide convenience, they offer companies the opportunity to compile an all-star team regardless of how long their commutes may be.http://metaventuregroup.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=520&amp;action=edit&amp;message=10<strong> Think about it:</strong>The purpose of a productive, successful company is to combine the various skills, talents and perspectives of a group of individuals to achieve corporate goals. Who&rsquo;s to say that the best talent is all centrally located in your city?As &ldquo;company headquarters&rdquo; transition from a physical location to an abstract concept, it&rsquo;s reported that in the U.S. there are currently <u> 2.9 million full-time virtual workers</u>; that&rsquo;s a remarkable 61 percent increase since 2005. When appropriate for a business, it&rsquo;s been found that virtual teams are actually outperforming traditional groups of co-located employees completing similar tasks. This may be why <u> <a href=\"http://www.aon.com/attachments/thought-leadership/bts_2009_results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  44 percent of companies </a></u> in the country have expressed interest in increasing their own virtual workforces in the upcoming years.More than being a cost effective solution in most cases, the pros surrounding virtual teams continue to mount. For starters, virtual teams offer flexibility, increased responsiveness and a noticeable improvement of resource utilization for most businesses. Compiling a virtual team gives directors and CEOs the ability cast a wide net when looking for the right talent for the job. This increases the amount of competition amongst prospects and ensures you don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; for someone with only some of the skill sets you&rsquo;re looking for, just because he or she can be in the office on time every morning.Because your team can easily be comprised of experts from other cities, states and even countries, the work day shifts from being eight hours to a complete 24-hour operation cycle if necessary. And when location is no longer a concern, neither is commuting. Less commuting and travel times means more hours logged completing the actual project.Still, to paint a picture of perfection wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate either. Virtual teams aren&rsquo;t without their own set of challenges. But as with most workplace dilemmas, these too can be solved with the right amount of planning and delegation. With coworkers all in one singular location it&rsquo;s more giving from a productivity standpoint to have less than stellar management. With a virtual team, however, communication and clear direction are vital to success.<strong> When compiling a virtual team it&rsquo;s imperative that, as the person in the management position, you create clear and concise roles and responsibilities for each employee.</strong>This involves coordinating who will do what, how decisions are going to be made, how often communications &mdash; be it via phone or email &mdash; will take place, and what consequences team members might expect if they aren&rsquo;t meeting preset expectations. And as the <u> Wall Street Journal</u> points out, it&rsquo;s essential that the team members be given tasks that are challenging in order to ward off decreased productivity.There should also be communication expectations placed on the leadership roles as well. Team members need to feel confident that their questions and concerns are being read and addressed by those in charge. This goes beyond creating an open-door policy, and instead, as <u> <a href=\"http://www.firmology.com/2014/09/11/mindreading-1-3-10-questions-to-ask-your-virtual-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Firmology </a></u> coins it, creating an open culture policy. Once a proper outline of roles and expectancies is established, maintaining them becomes easier. But be certain; with virtual teams, leadership is fundamental.Similarly, a lack of communication and structure may also lead to escalated conflicts among team members mainly because the group doesn&rsquo;t share the same camaraderie that forms in a traditional office. And because virtual teams are often comprised of individuals from vastly different backgrounds, cultural differences can easily add to any existing tension. When problems are left ignored it&rsquo;s unlikely they&rsquo;ll go away. But rather than pushing these differences aside, embracing and addressing them up front will make for a stronger foundation. For instance, <u> <a href=\"https://www.nojitter.com/virtual-teams-raising-productivity-or-silent-killer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  nojitter.com </a></u> recommends creating various social-bonding practices, such as virtual coffee breaks where team members can exchange personal information through a social media platform. Virtual teams have also formed stronger bonds by implementing a preset period of time where the group takes as little as five minutes prior to a scheduled meeting to catch up with one another.Having coworkers from various cultural backgrounds can also be a blessing rather than a source for tension. The diversity amongst the team brings with it different approaches to similar situations, creating a hot bed for innovation and critical thinking. When diversity is utilized to complete a project it can be amazing just how quickly ideas begin to spiral and take shape.Creating and properly executing a virtual workforce isn&rsquo;t just a pipe dream. Thousands of companies on the local and global levels and of various sizes have shifted towards this method. In fact, according to the <u> <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/03/how-virtual-teams-can-outperfo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Harvard Business Review </a></u>, conglomerates like General Electric, IBM, Ogilvy &amp; Mather and Nokia have also repositioned their workforces to include a number of virtual teams that support the staff in their physical locations across the country.If a virtual workforce might be advantageous for your company, there are a number of preliminary steps you can take to ensure success:<li> <strong>  Establish team rules and policies. </strong> This is vital and should include clearly defined protocol for important guidelines, including how quickly staff needs to respond to emails, questions or requests for action. Take it a step further by mapping out the steps to be taken when someone has been slow to respond. Setting rules for communication and role-specific responsibilities shouldn&rsquo;t become an information overload, but it will set a precedent for how well established the virtual team is.</li><li> <strong>  Create a directory of the virtual team and its members so that everyone can easily become more familiar with one another. </strong> Include information on each team member&rsquo;s specific area of expertise and how their role fits into the organization or current project. You should also facilitate productive, positive ways for members of a virtual team to communicate with one another, such an instant messaging tools.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/19/virtual-teams-meetings-leadership-managing-cooperation.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u>  refers to this as &ldquo;building trust differently.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Ensure that before the project starts </strong> , each person who is hired to work on the virtual team has a clear understanding of not only their specific role and responsibilities, but also the roles of the rest of the team and company&rsquo;s short and long-term goals.</li><li> <strong>  Initiate the use of collaborative software that makes project management amongst virtual teams more streamlined and error-free. </strong> There are dozens of project management software that makes around-the-clock work possible and without the possibility of human error.</li>",

    "content": "<p> Meet Ed Etheridge.</p><p> A staple at the local Farmers&rsquo; Market, Ed is my go-to guy for fruit. Every Thursday like clockwork, I check in with him to taste what&rsquo;s new, hear his stories about organic farming and buy my week&rsquo;s supply.</p><p> Ed&rsquo;s joy is introducing as many people as possible to his family&rsquo;s work of art and abiding passion&mdash;organic fruit.</p><p> <strong>  What is that if not tribe-building? </strong></p><p> The beauty of how Ed sells is that you can use the same elements to build your tribe, whether you&rsquo;re pitching advice, books or products. On-line or off-line. The key is in the experience you offer your audience.</p><p> <strong>  Deep expertise AND passion.  </strong> Ed can wax poetic on the differences between Santa Rosa plums and Black Beauties. He can talk about the effect of the drought and what it means for the future of organic farming. Just know that these two are closely intertwined&mdash;expertise without passion is a soulless transaction and passion without knowledge is amateur territory.</p><p> <strong>  Consistency. </strong>  With Ed, I know I can expect a friendly greeting. He&rsquo;ll ask about my week, remember that he&rsquo;ll need to coax me to try persimmons (but is up for the challenge). Being reliable is essential&mdash;and vastly underrated. Your audience needs to know they can count on you for what you&rsquo;ve taught them to expect.</p><p> <strong>  Tell me a story.  </strong> Trucking water in during the drought and how it changes the daily life of farming (and pricing) is fascinating when told as story. Or how they decide which fruit to grow when. You CAN educate your audience about your worldview without putting them to sleep. Just tell us a story&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Premium pricing/positioning. </strong> Ed&rsquo;s products are usually priced a bit above supermarket organics, although his taste far better. But here&rsquo;s the thing: a visit to the Farmers&rsquo; Market doesn&rsquo;t REPLACE the need to shop at the grocery store. And yet even with a premium price AND more effort on my part to get to his booth, I still can&rsquo;t get enough. How would your selling shift if you could do that with your business?</p><p> <strong>  Surprises. </strong>  One of my favorite things about the Etheridge booth is there is always a surprise. They rotate their products so that it&rsquo;s never the same display twice. Counterintuitive when clients like consistency? Not really&mdash;the juxtaposition of the trusted and familiar with (good) surprises ups the excitement factor.</p><p> <strong>  Scarcity.  </strong> At a Farmers&rsquo; Market, there is only so much they can truck in. The best stuff&mdash;the sweetest grapes, the delicate mandarins, early-season figs&mdash;goes fast. Once they&rsquo;re gone, they&rsquo;re gone. Creating that feeling that your client or buyer is going to miss something is a powerful incentive to buy right now.</p><p> All of these can help you grab the attention of your sweet-spot audience. <strong>  But let&rsquo;s not forget the Holy Grail of tribe-building&mdash;developing and nurturing a relationship with your buyers/readers. </strong></p><p> Creating shared experiences over time (consistently, with expertise, passion and the occasional surprise) is how you build strong bonds and true community. And maybe even learn to love pomegranates.</p><p> Tweetable Question: What&rsquo;s been your best tribe-builder? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConsultingChick\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @ConsultingChick  </u> </a></p>",

    "content": "<p> Is your customer acquisition (and retention) strategy based on discount pricing? <strong>  How's that working for you?  </strong> <br/> <br/> Discounts might be working well to bring customers in the door, but do they stay after they're in? Can you keep those that you acquire? Are you creating a precedence that is not sustainable? <br/> <br/> A couple weeks ago, I wrote a post about the phenomenon where customers buy on price but also leave on price. I answered the question,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/01/why-customers-really-leave.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   why do customers really leave  </a> </u> ? <br/> <br/> Today, I want to address the acquisition/retention strategy that many companies undertake - discounts: how they play into the price/value equation and how they impact or sabotage acquisition and retention efforts. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Is your customer acquisition strategy based on discounts, discounts, discounts? </strong> Whether your business is a subscription-based model (think dish/cable or telecom) or you're a retailer (think Kohl's) - or it's  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2011/11/black-friday-vs-cx-journey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Black Friday  </a> </u>  - you've used discounts to bring customers in the door. <br/> <br/> No doubt, customers love coupons, sales, and other discounts! I confess, I do, too. But I don't always buy a product or shop at a store because of a coupon. First, I have to have a need, or I have to be in the market for such a product. Second, if I've purchased from that company before, depending on the experience, the coupon may or may not entice me to purchase from them again. Discounts aren't a given; discounts don't mean that it's a slam dunk, that you'll make a sale. You still have to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/12/the-secret-to-customer-retention.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   work for it  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> I know that acquiring customers is important; I just wish that companies would put at least as much effort into keeping the customers they already have, with a real CX strategy. If they did, they wouldn't have to work so hard to get new ones. Not that they wouldn't need them - you always need customers to keep the business alive - but your existing customers would become an extension of your sales force and do some of the work for you. And save you money! <br/> <br/> People who buy because of discounts are classic examples of &ldquo;mercenaries.&rdquo; Mercenaries are one segment of customers in the classic HBR  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/02/apostle-model.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apostle Model  </a> </u> , a model used to segment customers based on two dimensions, satisfaction and loyalty. They are defined as customers with high satisfaction and low loyalty and are in your store or have subscribed to your service because they are/were driven largely by price.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  How do these customers feel about your company? Your brand? How was the experience? Can you keep them? </strong> On Black Friday, for example, they achieve at least short-term high satisfaction because they bought something they want/need at a reduced price; however, they are not committed to your company, hence not likely to purchase again (unless, of course, you offer up some more discounts). They aren't customers for life. You have not connected with them nor have you created a relationship with them. And, most likely, the experience was an after-thought. They haven't connected with you, either. The rest of the year, if you keep feeding them coupons every month, oh sure, they'll come back - if they need something and happen to have your coupon in hand. If they don't have a coupon, will they go elsewhere? <br/> <br/> <strong>  How do customers feel about your brand? </strong> There's an interesting story I'll share. It has many variations, and its origins are unclear; it is often attributed to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/300099-churchill-madam-would-you-sleep-with-me-for-five-million\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Winston Churchill  </a> </u> : <br/> <br/> Churchill: Madam, would you sleep with me for five million pounds? <br/> Socialite: My goodness, Mr. Churchill... well, I suppose... we would have to discuss terms, of course...  <br/> Churchill: Would you sleep with me for five pounds? <br/> Socialite: Mr. Churchill, what kind of woman do you think I am?! <br/> Churchill: Madam, we've already established that. Now we are just haggling about the price.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Something to contemplate... </strong> <br/> <br/> Can discounts be a viable acquisition strategy? Perhaps. The better question is probably, is it a viable retention strategy? If it is, it's a transactional relationship, not a long-term, ongoing relationship. As soon as something goes wrong - and it will - or a better deal comes along - and it will - customers are ready to switch (again, think cable, dish, or telecom providers). <br/> <br/> Once customers are in the door with discounts, they need to get hooked. I think you need to set expectations and then wean customers off discounts quickly. Price fairly. Deliver a great overall experience. (Price is part of the experience; it just shouldn't be the driving force behind the overall experience or behind why people stay/leave.) And help customers see the value over time. Price is what you pay, value is what you get... right?! So let's help customers see what they're getting for the price they pay - and help them understand that the relationship is not going to be based on that addictive drug called discounts. <br/> <br/> Think about your cable, dish, or telecom provider. These companies are notorious for their discounts, especially for new customers. By the time the customer's first year of extremely-discounted pricing has ended, he forgets that his fees are going to increase dramatically. When he gets that first bill at the new rate, he either wants to switch or demands another discount because, let's face it, the service was likely not that great (right, Comcast?). It sets a precedence; it creates an expectation for ongoing discounted pricing. And it creates and perpetuates that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/01/why-customers-really-leave.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   buy-on-price/leave-on-price phenomenon  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> Which came first, companies relying on discounts as an acquisition strategy or customers demanding discounts? Which is worse? Need some examples of companies that don't need to offer discounts? Apple and Ritz-Carlton come to mind. <br/> <br/> The customer rarely buys what the business thinks it sells him. One reason for this is, of course, that nobody pays for a &lsquo;product.&rsquo; What is paid for is satisfaction. But nobody can make or supply satisfaction as such&mdash;at best, only the means to attaining them can be sold and delivered. -Peter Drucker</p>",

    "link": "advisors-14-ways-to-improve-client-service-have-clients-fall-in-love-with-you",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Here are 14 tips your client service team can implement today and make your clients fall in love with your firm.</p><p> <strong>  1. Know Your Value Proposition </strong> <br/> One of the biggest mistakes in a value proposition is that client service teams are unable to communicate the message. Practice your message daily until you can recite it in one or two sentences - who you serve, what your business does, and why it is valuable.</p><p> <strong>  2. Be Available </strong> <br/> When a client calls, be available. Return phone calls as soon as you can even if you don&rsquo;t have answers to their questions. Let clients know you are working on a solution and provide a timeframe for the answer.</p><p> <strong>  3. Be Adaptable </strong> <br/> Each client is different and faces unique challenges and needs. Be aware their needs may change from week to week. Proactively ask clients if any changes have taken place that you should be aware of.  </p><p> <strong>  4. Let Clients Get to Know You </strong> <br/> Develop relationships with clients. When the timing is right, identify common interests and share information about yourself without becoming too personal. Let them know about an upcoming trip or organizational engagement. This provides another way for clients to connect with you and strengthen your ties.</p><p> <strong>  5. Practice Active Listening </strong> <br/> Have you ever had a conversation and wondered if the other person was listening to you? Listening has a significant impact on the relationship quality you have with your clients. Improve your listening skills by acknowledging with a nod of your head or a simple phrase stating, &ldquo;I hear you.&rdquo; </p><p> <strong>  6. Define the Lifecycle of Each Client </strong> <br/> Identify each stage a client will move through with your firm and assign responsibility to each phase. Communicate the transitions clearly to clients so there are no surprises when they move from working with an advisor to a client service associate.  </p><p> <strong>  7. Follow-Up After a Problem is Resolved </strong> <br/> A quick phone call or an email is an excellent way to let clients know you&rsquo;re on their side and to ensure clients are satisfied with your service.  </p><p> <strong>  8. Provide Lots of Ways to be Contacted </strong> <br/> Cater to your clients by providing a means for them to connect with you based on their preferred method of communication whether it be email, phone, skype, or in person.</p><p> <strong>  9. Ask Clients, &ldquo;How Can We Do Better?&rdquo; </strong> <br/> Make it a part of regular conversation to ask each client how you can do better. Create an easy way for clients to give you feedback through a client service survey or a form on your website. Clients appreciate the opportunity to chime in and, in turn, it shows you value their opinion.</p><p> <strong>  10. Share Interesting Content with Clients Every Day </strong> <br/> Clients rely on your knowledge about the products and services you offer. Stay abreast of industry news and share updates with your clients on a daily basis. Go a step further and send an article just for fun that will resonate with your clients.</p><p> <strong>  11. Maintain Relationships and Ask For Their Opinion </strong> <br/> Check in with your top clients on a monthly basis. Inquire about their week, how they are feeling, or ask their opinion on a gift you are contemplating buying for a friend. You will learn more about things they like.</p><p> <strong>  12. Commit Random Acts of Kindness and Deliver </strong> <br/> Do you know the origin of random acts of kindness? Anne Herbert is said to have once written, &ldquo;Practice random acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty&rdquo; on a place mat in a restaurant.&sup1; Random acts of kindness are a means by which we deliberately attempt to brighten another person&rsquo;s day. Do something thoughtful for a client; send a handwritten note, call them on their birthday, or congratulate them on their anniversary.</p><p> <strong>  13. Share Your Client Service Expertise with Your Peers </strong> <br/> When you find something new that helps clients, write it down and share it with your team.</p><p> <strong>  14. Always Say, &ldquo;Thank-You&rdquo; </strong> <br/> Have you ever left a place of business after making a purchase only to have no one say thank you? Oh boy, I have, and it leaves you feeling like the business just did you a favor! Always, always, always, thank your clients. If it weren&rsquo;t for them, you wouldn&rsquo;t have your job.</p><p> 1-Wikipedia, Random act of kindness; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_act_of_kindness\" target=\"_blank\">  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_act_of_kindness </a></p>",

    "link": "7-reasons-you-will-never-become-a-mentally-strong-leader",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  A reporter once asked me whether the FBI provides textbooks for agents to study so they can become mentally strong. The answer is no; FBI agents become mentally strong by facing their situation head-on&mdash;no sugarcoating allowed. </strong></p><p> As an FBI agent, I learned that mental strength is not something you are born with. It is something you can learn. If I learned it, so can you, but only if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the discipline and effort it takes.</p><p> You will not become a mentally strong leader if you:</p><p> <strong>  1. HAVEN&rsquo;T A CLUE ABOUT WHAT BRINGS YOU VALUE AND MEANING IN LIFE </strong></p><p> Mentally strong leaders live their life with purpose and meaning. They are an active participant in where their life is going. They have found a direction in life and set overarching goals for what they want to achieve.</p><p> Without goals to anchor us, we find ourselves adrift in life. We may think we know what our goals are, but if we aren&rsquo;t living our life around them, then we&rsquo;re not living our life on purpose.</p><p> <strong>  2. REMAIN IGNORANT ABOUT YOUR BLIND SPOTS </strong></p><p> Mentally strong leaders understand that they need to frequently, and critically, analyze their performance, especially their failures. When they do, they identity those patterns of behavior that are not productive and nip them in the bud. Unfortunately, &ldquo;teachable moments&rdquo; are usually accompanied by feelings of frustration, disappointment, and embarrassment. </p><p> Psychologists find that we tend to repeat the same mistake, and repeat it in endless variety. That is the definition of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://psych-your-mind.blogspot.com/2011/08/friday-fun-psychological-blind-spots.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blind spot  </a> </u> . </p><p> <strong>  3. BELIEVE YOU WILL ALWAYS LIVE A CHARMED LIFE </strong></p><p> Mentally strong leaders accept the fact that life evolves, and are smart enough to not be surprised when it does. It is natural to react with anger and skepticism because these emotions are trying to ensure your survival. But new situations can provide you with opportunities to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201205/the-psychology-regret\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   learn important lessons about yourself  </a> </u>  such as your reactions, values, vulnerabilities, triggers, and how to take better care of yourself</p><p> <strong>  4. PRETEND TO KNOW EVERYTHING </strong></p><p> Mentally strong leaders have a beginner&rsquo;s mind that does not need to prove or disprove anything. It has the humility to hold &ldquo;what I do know&rdquo; with &ldquo;what I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Holding this kind of tension leads to wisdom and not just easy answers.</p><p> When we allow ourselves the luxury of trial and error, like a child learning to walk, we experience a feel-good neurological response. Similarly, when tackling new and difficult challenges, we experience  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine\" target=\"_blank\">   a rush of adrenaline  </a> </u> , a hormone that makes us feel confident and motivated.</p><p> <strong>  5. AVOID CHALLENGES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY MAKE YOU GROW </strong></p><p> Mentally strong leaders have a growth mindset that looks at success as hard work, learning, training, and having the grit to keep moving ahead even when faced with obstacles and roadblocks.</p><p> A growth mindset anticipates transitions that come from uncertainty because it interprets failure as nothing more than an opportunity for learning and improvement.</p><p> <strong>  6. REFUSE TO KEEP EGO IN CHECK </strong></p><p> Mentally strong leaders know how to keep a tight rein on ego. The ego is always asking &ldquo;How will this make me look? How will I benefit?&rdquo; It looks for ways to prove it is right and others are wrong.</p><p> When we keep ego in check, there is room for the wisdom of others to get in. We are able to listen more deeply, learn with an open mind, and adapt new skill sets.</p><p> <strong>  7. HAVE A COWARD&rsquo;S HEART </strong></p><p> Mentally strong leaders have  <u>  the courage to move out of their comfort zone </u>  and into their zone of  <u>  discomfort </u>  where they may feel awkward, clumsy, and alone. </p><p> When we get into a comfort zone, we often strive to stay right there&mdash;where we have found success. But it is the average leader who stops at success, because success and peak performance are often two different things. Whole lives are spent reinforcing mediocre performance.</p><p> &ldquo;Mental toughness is believing you will prevail in your circumstances, rather than believing that your circumstances will change&rdquo;&mdash;LaRae Quy</p><p> <strong>  Are you ready to become a mentally strong leader? </strong></p> ",

    "content": "<p> Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory who famously once said that the opposite of a trivial truth is false; the opposite of a great truth is also true. This is a great way to think about your own business and even beyond what you stand for. I&rsquo;ve long held the belief that a clear sign that a brand has reached a level of maturity and comfort in its own skin is to know what it stands against. For many brands, figuring out what they stand for is a big enough challenge.</p><p> Taking a stand against something, anything takes guts. It takes conviction. It means risk. Risk of alienating those whose beliefs don&rsquo;t align. Risk of being questioned, doubted, ignored. But that&rsquo;s okay; holding strong beliefs against an issue align you with those most aligned with your brand. Your decisions are lauded for their courage &ndash; you didn&rsquo;t do it for the accolades of course &ndash; but your core brand fanatics fall deeper in love with you.</p><p> A mature, confident, brand will do whatever it takes to live up to their beliefs and if that means publicly standing against the thing that threatens to violate those beliefs then so be it.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.latenightslice.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mikey&rsquo;s Late Night Slice  </a> </u>  is a hallowed fixture of the nightlife in the Short North Arts District in Columbus, Ohio. Though pretty much flying below the radar for anyone outside of Columbus, Mikey&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-diaz/lgbt-tolerance_b_2397363.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   made headlines  </u>  nationally </a>  in 2013 when they refused service to homophobic customers waiting in line. On the surface that just seems like a good human decision. It is, but it&rsquo;s more than that, it&rsquo;s how  <u>  Mikey Sorboro </u>  runs his business. A quick look at his mission statement hanging up over the ordering window at each of his restaurants demonstrates a belief that made it easy for the employee that night to say no to serving those customers, confident that he would have the full backing of his boss and his company. Can you say that your brand is strong enough internally for your employees to make decisions like that? Mikey&rsquo;s clearly believes in something enough to stand against something else.</p><p> Many client brand books I&rsquo;ve reviewed included sections on &ldquo;What we are&rdquo; and &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re not&rdquo;. This is a great start as long as it&rsquo;s truly informed by your core beliefs and values and that you allow staff to make decisions with these beliefs as a guide. These &ldquo;we are/we&rsquo;re not&rdquo; statements should  <u>  not be exhaustive </u>  but rather a strong guide as to acceptable values and position for your company.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   L Brands  </a> </u> , owner of Victoria&rsquo;s Secret has a phrase they use internally to decide on designs, aesthetic and marketing: &ldquo;Sexy not slutty&rdquo;.</p><p> Mini Cooper has being playing up it&rsquo;s <u>  <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/news/bmw-s-mini-fends-rivals-normal-ads/243609/?utm_source=daily_email&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=adage&amp;ttl=1377172793\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    &ldquo;not normal&rdquo; position  </a> </u>  for a few years now, standing against run of the mill vehicles and larger car companies. It may not be an altruistic effort, but it does align with their core beliefs and values.</p><p> Begin with articulating, documenting and sharing your core beliefs. From here, start to think about what that means you stand against. You may discover this approach to outreach and marketing suits your brand better.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We&rsquo;ve heard from some advisors that writing a  <u>  blog </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://ext-marketing.com/blog/744/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   newsletter  </a> </u>  is overwhelming. That&rsquo;s understandable, as a seemingly unlimited number of ideas can make it difficult to start. To make your life easier, we&rsquo;ve put together a list of 26 blog post and newsletter ideas.</p><p> <strong>  1. Your business beliefs in action </strong> <br/> Tell a brief story about how you helped a client, and how that aligns with your beliefs.</p><p> <strong>  2. Annual market review </strong> <br/> Summarize what happened in the markets, and how your clients were affected.</p><p> <strong>  3. Charitable support </strong> <br/> Highlight a charity you support, and explain why they are worthy of help.</p><p> <strong>  4. Your history </strong> <br/> Go beyond your bio and tell clients a little bit more about yourself.</p><p> <strong>  5. Meet the team </strong> <br/> Give your team a voice! You could write one long post, or give each team member a post all to themselves.</p><p> <strong>  6. Retirement expenses </strong> <br/> Provide a realistic outlook about expenses that your clients may face in retirement.</p><p> <strong>  7. Start saving early </strong> <br/> Write a post for your clients&rsquo; children, telling them the importance of financial discipline.</p><p> <strong>  8. Books that inspired you </strong> <br/> Many books have been written about saving and investing. Which ones inspired you? Which ones would you like your clients to read?</p><p> <strong>  9. This year&rsquo;s reading list </strong> <br/> Reading is essential if you&rsquo;re going to stay ahead of the game. Every January, let your clients know what&rsquo;s on your reading list.</p><p> <strong>  10. The hobby post </strong> <br/> If you have a hobby that lends itself to being a metaphor for what you do at work, explain how.</p><p> <strong>  11. Professional development update </strong> <br/> What have you been learning lately? If it&rsquo;s sharable, share!</p><p> <strong>  12. Explain financial regulations </strong> <br/> Building trust involves straightforward explanations about complicated matters. Do your best to keep your clients up to date.</p><p> <strong>  13. The crystal ball post </strong> <br/> Write about current trends and what you see happening next. Be sure to avoid market-specific comments.</p><p> <strong>  14 to 16. Client success stories </strong> <br/> Names can be withheld, of course. These three can become static testimonials on your website.</p><p> <strong>  17 to 19. Investing heroes </strong> <br/> Write brief bios for your investing heroes, highlighting how they left a lasting impression on you. Start with three so you can see what it&rsquo;s like to write an engaging series of posts that are related to one another.</p><p> <strong>  20. Asset allocation </strong> <br/> Explain what it is and your take on it.</p><p> <strong>  21. Active vs. passive </strong> <br/> Every investor is talking about this, so add your voice to the conversation.</p><p> <strong>  22. In the news </strong> <br/> If something big happens in the world of financial services, from market swings to changes at a very visible company, explain to your clients what&rsquo;s going on.</p><p> <strong>  23. Why work with an advisor? </strong> <br/> This is a good prospecting tool. You could reuse it as a one-pager for meetings with potential clients.</p><p> <strong>  24. RRSPs vs. mortgages </strong> <br/> If you&rsquo;re working in a city where house prices are rising, this will be highly relevant to your younger clients.</p><p> <strong>  25. Tax-reduction strategies </strong> <br/> Tax questions are always on investors&rsquo; minds, so why not show them that you have some answers?</p><p> <strong>  26. How are investors charged for their advisor&rsquo;s services? </strong> <br/> Transparency regarding your compensation is a good discussion to have.</p><p> That makes 26 blog and newsletter content ideas to share with your clients. Stay tuned because we&rsquo;re thinking about expanding the list to 52 next week!</p><p> To keep you on track, create an  <u>  editorial calendar </u>  so you know what&rsquo;s next and when you&rsquo;ll need to  <u>  come up with </u>  more ideas.</p>",

    "link": "book-review-to-succeed-at-sales-get-rid-of-the-abc-mentality",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> How to Succeed at Sales</strong>The old approach at sales known as the ABC&rsquo;s of Selling or &ldquo;Always Be Closing&rdquo; is the opposite approach you should take if you want to be successful, according to the title of Jane Murphy&rsquo;s pocket guide &ldquo;There&rsquo;s No Such Thing as Closing the Deal: A Brief(case) Guide to Successful Sales&rdquo;.When you want to know how to close more sales, it just makes sense that you&rsquo;d seek advice from one of the most highly recognized and successful sales team executives in the financial industry. Jane Murphy knows how to convert prospects into clients and in this brief guide, she shares the strategies and secrets she used to hit record numbers while leading the national sales division at Fidelity.<strong> Meet the Author</strong>Jane Murphy is the founder of <u> <a href=\"http://accelerationretirement.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Acceleration Retirement </a></u> and has been selling financial services since the 1980&rsquo;s and focused on the retirement plan business since the early 1990&rsquo;s. Working for Fidelity Investments, she built a sales organization from 3 employees to well over 100. She also built a lead generation team from scratch to over 60 associates. Jane is well known for highly innovative sales approaches and processes. Her team produced over $3 billion in assets under management per year while selling no plan with greater than $5 million in assets (ALL OVER THE PHONE). Jane&rsquo;s lead generation team produced over 3,000 leads a year in all sizes of the retirement plan market including the tax exempt market. Jane is a sought after leader well known for turning lead generation associates into salespeople.I met Jane when my former partner, Don Settina, hired her firm to provide point of sale marketing material and lead generation services to help him grow his 401k practice.  I liked her from the start because of her direct style, obvious insight into what works, and passion for getting results for her clients.  I was even fortunate enough to have an opportunity to attend one of her sales training workshops and there&rsquo;s no one I&rsquo;d recommend more for sales strategies that work.<strong> What to Expect</strong>This guide provides an honest, and sometimes funny, look at topics like research, rejection, and getting past the gatekeeper. You&rsquo;ll find step-by-step tips, scripts, and quips on the entire sales process from the first phone call to the first appointment and beyond.Here&rsquo;s an example of some of the section titles (you have to love a great sense of humor):<li> Don&rsquo;t Make Me Pick Up the Phone!</li><li> Holy####! I Have the Prospect On The Phone.</li><li> OMG! I&rsquo;m in a Conversation. Now What Do I Do?</li><li> Okay, the Call Was Easy. But Now I&rsquo;ve Got to Meet With Him!</li><li> The Meeting Went Well.  Why Haven&rsquo;t They Called?</li>It&rsquo;s a short read (bullet point style) but chock full of valuable information. Jane&rsquo;s no-nonsense training style comes through and this book has what you need to know without the typical drawn-out back-story and fluff (which is why I&rsquo;d highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for actionable ways to convert prospects into clients).The end of the book has a list of interesting and engaging questions you can ask prospects that are not your typical &ldquo;Are you happy with your provider?&rdquo; type question. The questions listed are meant to elicit ongoing dialogue, get your prospect to think and engage, and provide valuable insight into the decision making process.  There&rsquo;s really nothing I didn&rsquo;t like about this book but if I had to add a wishlist for Jane I&rsquo;d ask for more sample questions (there are more than 20 questions listed, I&rsquo;m just a glutton for good ideas!)I&rsquo;ve always heard the saying &ldquo;people buy what&rsquo;s in front of them&rdquo; and this guide leaves you with the same reminder: &ldquo;Sales success is about being with the prospect at the right time. Prospect buy when they are ready. If you&rsquo;ve built a connection, you&rsquo;ll get their business.&rdquo;<strong> If Telemarketing is Your Strategy&hellip;</strong>I&rsquo;d recommend this guide for any sales professional (not just retirement or financial industry sales &ndash; ANY sales professional) that wants to learn simple, yet highly effective strategies for connecting with and converting prospects into clients.You can grab a copy of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083W09S0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0083W09S0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=americandre09-20&amp;linkId=TQLZYNEKUJCTQTUQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo; <u>  There&rsquo;s No Such Thing As Closing the Deal&rdquo; here on Amazon.com\" </u>  </a>and if you want more advanced sales training, I&rsquo;d recommend heading over to Jane&rsquo;s company website at <u> <a href=\"http://accelerationretirement.com/howwehelp.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  accelerationretirement.com </a></u> and checking out her new sales bootcamp.",

    "link": "dont-you-forget-about-me-private-clients-in-ma",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The last year or so has seen a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the private client world. Even the normally sedate private office market had some big news with SandAire and Lord North Street, and Stonehage and Fleming Family &amp; Partners joining forces. The legal sector saw Speechly Bircham and Charles Russell merge, and in December private client firms Hunters and May, May &amp; Merrimans announced they were merging this year.</p><p> 2015 year has got off to an active start with further consolidation in the IFA market courtesy of AFH, Tavistock Investments and Towry to name a few and time will tell if some of the big moves of last year in the private client investment manager space will see activity of the size of Old Mutual/ Quilter Cheviot, Rathbones/Jupiter or Tilney/BestInvest.</p><p> The key drivers for such deals inevitably differ widely although the rising cost of compliance and the associated virtues of scale loom large for FCA-regulated firms. Whatever the underlying reasons for any decision to merge or acquire, all private client firms face a common challenge in terms of the importance of taking their clients&rsquo; goodwill with them.</p><p> There is often a cultural reticence in communicating from the centre with clients in what may be seen as going over the head of the front office/fee earners who may be quick to point out that reassuring clients that their business is in safe hands is their job.</p><p> If this was ever wholly true, it&rsquo;s not an argument that stands up well in today&rsquo;s world for a number of reasons however.</p><p> <strong>  NEWS TRAVELS FAST </strong></p><p> Clients will probably find out all sorts of news and developments before you can tell them anyway. Any ability we traditionally had to ring-fence &ldquo;trade&rdquo; and &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; media fell away some years ago in a world where headlines are grabbed from the newswires and tweeted before you&rsquo;ve had a chance to clean your teeth in the morning.</p><p> <strong>  CLIENTS WILL HOLD FIRMS TO ACCOUNT IF THEY ARE NOT PRIORITISED </strong></p><p> This was neatly summed up late last year by The Financial Times&rsquo; Jonathan Guthrie in a spoof piece entitled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d2fc4c28-213c-11e4-a958-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3QQCJh0Q8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RBS must respect royal prerogative in changing Coutts  </a> </u> &rdquo; purportedly from the Queen to Coutts noting a sound of caution as the bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;best known customer&rdquo;: &ldquo;Just make sure that in &lsquo;grinding out efficiencies&rsquo; in domestic retail banking, you don&rsquo;t forget Coutts customers still expect a top drawer service.&rdquo;</p><p> Taking clients with you is imperative. They have a stake &ndash; literally probably if you are a public company. Forward thinking firms are using communications that are more than one way information dissemination via letter/email and a quick call to key introducers. Options might include inviting clients and business partners into your confidence, creating permanent or semi-permanent advisory boards to get their input into your business and/or ad hoc panels to get direct insight into specific projects such as any rebranding.</p><p> <strong>  CLIENTS NEED MORE COMFORT </strong></p><p> This isn&rsquo;t designed to undermine the adviser-client relationship but to underpin it, to reinforce a client&rsquo;s importance to the firm. In a world where clients are increasingly aware and concerned about the perceived precariousness of the financial sector, clients want to be crystal clear who they are dealing with and how safe, secure and commercially viable the firms charged with the stewardship of their assets are.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t just an issue for client retention. Clients and introducers need to be confident that if they are referring a firm or an adviser that they know exactly what sort of client that firm is looking for and what sorts of client needs it can address. They don&rsquo;t want to create any embarrassment either for themselves for the firms that they are referring, or for the potential client they are referring. The process of referral needs to be carefully nurtured at the best of times but needs particular attention when firms are undergoing seismic change.</p>",

    "title": "$217 a Gallon for Grape Juice",
    "link": "217-a-gallon-for-grape-juice",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CraigCamp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Craig Camp  </a> </u></p><p> A recent article on The Drinks Business quotes Tor Kenward saying he was paying $26,000 a ton for Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabernet Sauvignon fruit. <strong>  That's $217 per gallon for grape juice or about $43 a bottle for just the grapes </strong> .</p><p> Certainly this is an extreme example, but it is symptomatic about what is happening in the Napa Valley. Over the last several years the prices of grapes has been moving inexorably higher with no signs of slowing down. The Napa Valley average for cabernet sauvignon now approaches $6,000 a ton and that's for the fruit you don't want. That average includes all the truckloads of grapes going to the big producers like Beringer and Mondavi. The grapes someone like me wants start at $7,500 a ton and moves up quickly for anything with a sub-appellation. </p><p> The old rule-of-thumb used to be that you could estimate the bottle price you needed to get to make money on your wine by from the cost of the fruit. For example pay $6,000 a ton and you would need to sell your wine at $60, pay $9,000 a ton and you would need to charge $90 a bottle. Estimating this way is surprisingly accurate. </p><p> The rising prices for cabernet sauvignon means that the ongoing squeezing out of non-Bordeaux grape varieties in the Napa Valley will only be accelerated. If you were a farmer would you plant a crop that brought in $28,000 an acre or $14,000 an acre, but cost you the same to produce?</p><p> You can see what road the Napa Valley is heading down. Before too long $100 a bottle will be the entry level Cabernet Sauvignon wines. This is very disconcerting for a winemaker whose goal in life to to have people drink their wines. I'm afraid soon they will only be wines for label drinkers not wine drinkers. A frustrating reality for someone who believes wines are for pleasure, not worship.</p><p> You can't argue with the numbers. It looks like its time to look beyond the Napa Valley for exceptional fruit sources. We've been in Oregon for years now, but that was for a different reason, as I felt California was not the place for the type of chardonnay and pinot noir I wanted to make. I went to Oregon for quality reasons not economic ones. Yet spending time in Oregon only reminds you how prices in the Napa Valley, for everything not just grapes, have passed into fantasy land.</p><p> All I'm looking to do is live in the real world of wine, where real people drink and enjoy my wines without having to feel guilty about how much they spent. More and more as I get older I seem drawn to simpler pleasures and the wines at my table more often than not come from places like Beaujolais, Chorey-les-Beaune, C&ocirc;tes du Rh&ocirc;ne, Corsica and Spain. Simply delicious wines that enhance my meals and my life without doing any damage to my conscience. That's not to say I don't love the great bottles when they come my way, but greatness is not defined by what the wine costs, but by how the wine tastes. The simple fact is that the most hyped and expensive wines in the world rarely live up to expectations and you can always, and I mean always, find wines from the same region that equal or exceed these unicorn wines in both quality and value. </p><p> To return to the example of the $217 a gallon grape juice, this liquid gold comes from To Kalon, which is more a district than a vineyard due to it huge size, some 690 acres. Compare that to Chambertin at 33.5 acres, Clos de Vougeot at 122 acres or even a big estate like Ch&acirc;teau Lafite Rothschild at 265 acres. At four tons an acre To Kalon would produce 2,760 tons of fruit, which would produce almost 2,000,000 bottles of wine. To Kalon is a blessed district producing some of the finest cabernet sauvignon in the world, but a rarity it is not.</p><p> So what does this mean for Cornerstone Cellars? First it means that we have to work harder than ever to ferret out those truly distinctive small blocks of vineyards owned by growers with more pride than ego. We have four such sites that are truly extraordinary: Oakville Station (which is actually in To Kalon), Red Lake on Howell Mountain, Grigsby in Yountville and Kairos on the edges of Oak Knoll and Coombsville. These vineyards are the cornerstone of our White Label selections. For our Black Label and Artist Series wines we are casting a wider net in order to find the finest vineyards regardless of appellation. Sonoma, El Dorado, Santa Barbara and on and on, the possibilities in California are almost without limit and we'll explore then all. No matter what we will continue our vision of making fresh, acid-driven wines that come to life on your palate. </p><p> After all, we may start out with grape juice, but what we end up with is very, very special and, in our case, very, very personal. Personal means personality and it means that Cornerstone is for pleasure, both yours and ours.</p><p> See you at the dinner table.</p>",

For example, when I will only do something one time, then I want specific instructions to get it done quickly so I can move on. A good example of this is changing my password on LinkedIn.Other times are when something is new to me, or not a skill I want to develop into a core competency. Examples of this are  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1047805\" target=\"_blank\">  expanding my circles in Google+ </a> , or enhancing the reach of the digital marketing for my company. <strong>  Yesterday I experienced a third type of learning situation. </strong>   A speaker presented on &ldquo;workplace diversity.&rdquo;  He did a marvelous job of telling his story so I got to know him and wanted to learn more. Then he talked about the benefits of workplace diversity and some changes he&rsquo;s seen in his consulting practice.  It was a great talk and I was really engaged listening to him.But I left wanting more, and not very inspired.</p><strong> Why? </strong>He did not share any specific examples of success that I could internalize and share. And, he did not give me a place to start to change my behavior to be live up to his wonderful ideals of diversity.So, while I usually like to figure it out on my own, some specific instructions are usually needed to get me started on a new path. It&rsquo;s the reason that musicians learn scales and chords, and other basics, before improvising or jamming with others.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Twitter is no different from any other communication method. </strong> It is bit like an on-line telephone, people can communicate with other people or companies. You just do it in a short and snappy way.</p><p> <strong>  I Know I should be on Twitter but Don&rsquo;t Want to Tweet </strong></p><p> 50% of accounts don&rsquo;t Tweet, they listen.</p><p> Let me talk about my Granny for a second.  She had a phone so we could call her, but never made any calls herself.  In the same way you can use Twitter to listen, but you don&rsquo;t need to Tweet.</p><p> <strong>  12 Reasons why you should be on Twitter (Without even Tweeting once!) </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Save Money </strong> &ndash; Companies often offer money off vouchers or discounts. When you get onto Twitter, follow your favorite brands and save money.</p><p> <strong>  2. Get tickets for West End shows </strong> &mdash; Tickets for shows, Opera, Ballet are often offered over Social Media a day before the show. They are often released via a hashtag you need to search on.</p><p> <strong>  3. Win </strong> &ndash; Companies will run competitions over Twitter with prizes.</p><p> <strong>  4. Get Packages Redelivered </strong> &mdash; You are away from home and a package is delivered and you need to get it redelivered. Contact the Courier Company over Twitter.</p><p> <strong>  5. Find out about Travel Delays </strong> &ndash; Most Travel companies are online, such as airlines, airports and in most cases there is a &ldquo;real person&rdquo; that you can interact with.  I&rsquo;ve been in situations at Heathrow where information boards went down, but was able to keep up with delay information by &ldquo;talking&rdquo; over Twitter with the airline Twitter account.</p><p> <strong>  6. Get Pre-Sale Tickets </strong> &ndash; When you get on Twitter follow you favorite bands / artists / groups; often they will offer tickets before they are offered to the general public.  One gig I went to &ldquo;exclusive small event for fans&rdquo; was only offered over Twitter.</p><p> <strong>  7. Get Up-To-Date News </strong> &mdash; Follow you favorite news channels, Social Media now carry the exclusives before the television.  You can also find news channels or interesting people (like me) who Tweet about information in a niche subject area you may have.  (Why not jump in and debate these subjects?)</p><p> <strong>  8. Get a Job </strong> &ndash; Get a Better Job? &ndash;Employers want to employ people today who are Thought Leaders in an area.  While 10 years ago having Word or Excel on your CV was a requirement, now employers look for (at least) an understanding of Social Media.  (50% of the people I have trained in Social Media have gone on to get a better job.)</p><p> <strong>  9. Get Answers to Questions </strong> &mdash; Many people use Twitter as an alternative &ldquo;search engine&rdquo; for search (I do, for example).  As Social Search becomes more relevant than Google, it&rsquo;s a useful source of data.  You can of course Tweet questions out to your followers.</p><p> <strong>  10. Learn Something New </strong> &mdash; If like me you think that &ldquo;every day is a school day&rdquo; and that life is about continual learning, you can follow people and learn some amazing facts.</p><p> <strong>  11. See some incredible photography, from amateur and professional photographers. </strong></p><p> <strong>  12. Keep up with your favorite celebrities, bands and TV shows. </strong>   Many TV shows have a hashtag which you can follow while you watch.  Watch or join in the debate.</p>",

    "link": "sales-decks-create-the-kind-that-sell",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Sales Decks have been on our mind a lot lately. Not just because we have been rocking them for clients like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/18207677/Skyword-Sales-Deck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Skyword  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/18207659/Resolution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Resolution  </a> </u> , but also because it seems as though everyone these days is closing some amazing deal and walking away with bags full of cash.</p><p> <strong>  Sales decks typically take one of two forms: </strong></p><p> Terribly boring, text-laden clunky things that people suffer through out of sheer obligation. These usually delve into the super technical, talk solely about features and not about benefits and end up saying a lot about nothing leaving you confused and unlikely to buy.</p><p> Or</p><p> You have the salesman that comes in completely unprepared, hair disheveled, bent business cards&hellip; and wings it with an overly broad focus and invariably ends up using filler words that leads your audience to not have a single shred of confidence in you.</p><p> Either way, your sale is looking as likely as Blackberry coming up with an iPhone killer.</p><p> Because we want you to walk away from your sales meeting with bags full of cash, we created a guide on how to build a great sales presentation. At the end of this guide, we have included even a template to get you started&hellip;</p><p> But first things first, what is a sales deck?</p><p> A sales deck is a presentation in slide format, that you can send or pitch to clients to give them data on the company&rsquo;s key facts. The deck should be a visual representation of what you plan to discuss in the meeting. Illustration and graphs work, small illegible text does not.  <strong>  Any pitch deck should walk you through a story, but your sales deck should also walk you through your process along with your capabilities and case studies that back up your claims. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Things not to include in a sales deck </strong> <br/> Your sales deck should be sparse and to the point and should in no way resemble a Flash website hailing from the pre-Y2K era. This means avoiding extra text that doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to the main point of what you are trying to accomplish. Avoid outrageous text, images, animation and colors. It should be a tool in your arsenal that fits within your branding and your organization.</p><p> <strong>  OK, great, but when do you use a sales deck? </strong> <br/> You should prepare your sales deck for any situation that you plan to ask for a sale. Your perfectly prepared sales presentation deck serves as a way for clients to see whom you&rsquo;ve worked with or sold to in the past and the process that is going to take them from problem to solution. Your deck should focus heavily on your solution and should end in you asking for the sale.</p><p> <strong>  What are the exact elements of a great sales deck? </strong> <br/> There is no standard when it comes to a sales presentation. Whether you are creating a custom slide deck or working from a template, you should follow a formula, but within that formula you should add the custom elements that make your particular solution stand out.</p><p> Below is how we typically structure a sales deck.</p><p> <strong>  Presentation Cover </strong> <br/> Your cover should be simple, branded with your logo and not much else. This isn&rsquo;t the slide to put every piece of your contact info on. Frankly, at this point, the client doesn&rsquo;t even know if they want to contact you so putting your information in their face at this point is quite presumptuous.</p><p> <strong>  The Pitch </strong> <br/> This is the slide that should define your deck. All focus should be on this message. This slide should be sparse with 1-2 lines of copy that describes what your purpose is.</p><p> <strong>  Why </strong> <br/> This slide should answer why the person listening to this pitch should want to do business with you. Why you are the best to address the problem that they have? Is your solution the Golden Ticket into the Chocolate Factory? In this slide you should be giving your audience background into why you will rock their world.</p><p> <strong>  Details about the solution you are offering </strong> <br/> This slide should take a deeper look at your solution. This is the rock your world slide. Whether it is screenshots, an illustrated explanation or product photos, this slide or slides should focus on your actual product and its technical specifications that make your solution superior. But don&rsquo;t get too technical. This slide should be tailored to your audience. It should be the evidence that supports your &ldquo;why&rdquo; slide that came before it.</p><p> <strong>  Now that you&rsquo;ve talked about your solution, tell them exactly who that solution is for. </strong> <br/> If you are selling to a store, this slide should align you with the person you are presenting to. Your target market should be their target market. You should explain to them why their customers will want to buy your product. By showing them that you understand their buyer and that your buyer is their buyer, you are mitigating risk and instilling confidence. In fact, not only can you tell them this with this slide, but the next slides (your shiny as a whistle case study slides) will demonstrate real life examples of your solution (thriving) in practice.</p><p> <strong>  Case Studies </strong> <br/> Case Studies are used to validate everything you have said thus far. Adding large brands that you have worked with here or brands that will mean something to the person you are pitching to adds serious credibility to everything you are saying. Don&rsquo;t just talk about the client, talk about how you donned your armor and rose to the occasion to beat their expectations.</p><p> <strong>  Comparison </strong> <br/> After you hit your audience with your case studies, eliminate any other doubts by showing how you stack up against your competitors.Whether you use a competitive landscape plot or matrix, visually demonstrating your benefits vs. your competitors can swing the tide in your favor.</p><p> <strong>  Traction </strong> <br/> After you have demonstrated individual success stories, show them how you are doing as a whole. The evidence is your traction slide and it should provide further big picture validation that you are firmly entrenched into the industry you are selling in. This validation could be number of sales, downloads, users or any other metric that is key to your business.</p><p> <strong>  Clients and Partners </strong> <br/> Your client and partner slides provide further validation and can be as simple as a few logos and testimonials.</p><p> <strong>  Contact </strong> <br/> Your final slide should let your audience or reader know how they can contact you to purchase your solution.</p><p> <strong>  Summary </strong> <br/> Selling is an art form&hellip; so are sales decks. Let&rsquo;s not forget that your visuals are something you should take seriously.

    "link": "body-language-of-leaders-president-obama",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> What kind of body language do leaders use? In this series from <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People  </u> </a> we&rsquo;re having a look at the body language of real and fictional leaders.</p><p> <strong>  In this edition: President Obama. </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s have a look at the State of the Union speech. It&rsquo;s a speech that lasts little over an hour, but for this post I&rsquo;m only looking at the first 10 minutes. Even in a timespan that short we can see some interesting body language.</p><p> <strong>  Great use of hand gestures </strong></p><p> Not per se a trait of great leaders but definitely something that boosts their charisma: the use of great hand gestures. President Obama does this very well throughout his speech. He uses the thumb and index finger to emphasize important points. He is quite literally &ldquo;making his point&rdquo;.</p><p> He also uses gestures like a wave of the hand to illustrate a spectrum of things or a timespan. By doing this, he is very clear in his communication with his audience as his nonverbal communication is perfectly in sync with his verbal content.</p><p> How can you use this?</p><p> By using gestures you can make it easier for your audience to understand what you&rsquo;re saying. So whenever you are explaining something to another person make sure you use hand gestures. This will make you come across as more charismatic and more lively.</p><p> <strong>  Little to no amount of smiling </strong></p><p> Another body language trait of leaders is a low amount of smiling. You can see President Obama doing the same thing. He is not smiling as he is delivering his speech. His message, being the State of the Union, is a very important one so smiling would not be appropriate in this case.</p><p> Smiling can sometimes be seen as a sign of submission. The President definitely doesn&rsquo;t want to appear submissive and therefore doesn&rsquo;t smile at all as he delivers his speech.</p><p> How can you use this?</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t want to appear submissive in a serious situation like in a negotiation or during a business meeting, try to limit your smiling. Of course it&rsquo;s okay to smile every once in a while or people might start thinking of you as cold, but try to limit it and to not be grinning all the time.</p><p> <strong>  Purposeful movement </strong></p><p> When leaders move they do so with a purpose. They don&rsquo;t waste energy and time on pacing back and forth (or at least not publicly). You can see the same thing with President Obama in his State of the Union speech. He barely moves behind his podium. In this situation it wouldn&rsquo;t be very appropriate to move, of course.</p><p> How can you use this?</p><p> How purposeful is your movement? Do you find yourself pacing as you&rsquo;re delivering a presentation? This can be seen as anxious behavior so be careful with it. Leaders never want to appear anxious so try to be conscious of your amount of movement and whether it&rsquo;s purposeful.</p><p> <strong>  Clarity of speech </strong></p><p> In his speech, you will never catch the President be unsure about his words. He knows exactly what message he wants to convey to the public. His clarity of speech makes him appear more credible and very confident of himself. At the same time, he makes great use of pauses to let his point sink in and to give his audience time to consider what he is saying.</p><p> How can you use this?</p><p> Try to avoid saying &ldquo;ehm&rdquo; during your conversations. People can take that as a sign of a disorganized mind of someone who doesn&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re trying to say. Definitely not how you want to come across, right? So try to train yourself out of using filler words like &ldquo;ehm&rdquo; and &ldquo;eh&rdquo; to show that you&rsquo;re clear about what you want to say.</p><p> What leader should I analyze next?</p><p> Do you have a leader you want me to analyze? Whether it&rsquo;s a world leader or a fictional leader if you leave their name and a link to a video in the comments I&rsquo;ll consider writing a blogpost on him or her!</p><p> This guest post is by one of our body language experts in training: Michiel Andreae from The Netherlands. He loves to teach people how to improve their communication skills through body language and to coach people to make better use of their nonverbal skills.

    "link": "what-fairy-tales-can-teach-us-about-marketing-financial-services",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Fairy tales are an important tool for helping our kids develop. And we should not leave them behind simply because we become grown-ups. In fact, the importance to parents of these ancient teaching techniques translates well into the marketing of an advisory practice and even, in fact, into the delivery of advice.</p><p> <a href=\"/category/sell/marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I have written </a>  before about the importance of storytelling in marketing and others have discussed its role in advising clients. A few of the specific benefits of stories,  <u>  <a href=\"http://imaginationsoup.net/2012/02/fairy-tales-are-essential-to-childhood/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   and fairytales in particular  </a> </u> , are worth going into in more detail.</p><p> <strong>  The brain is wired to remember stories </strong> &ndash; People don&rsquo;t remember features and benefits. They don&rsquo;t remember lists. They remember stories, especially about people. When we form a memory, it is not a collection of data points &ndash; it is a story. If we come across a fact we have not seen or did not expect, our brain creates a story about it so that we can remember it. When we interpret what other people say or write, we develop stories about what those people meant or how they felt. Stories seem to be integral to the functioning of our brain. In fact, the neurotransmitter dopamine that stimulates pleasure is triggered by curiosity. That is the neurochemical foundation for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2012/08/14/wired-for-story-lisa-cron/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the reason that it is difficult to put down a really good book  </a> </u> . Therefore, translating your skills, your services, or the benefits of working with your firm into stories simply caters to how your clients&rsquo; minds desire information.</p><p> <strong>  Stories show clients how to solve problems </strong>  &ndash; rather than a technical, dispassionate (and boring) description of how you might assist a client address a challenge, a story illustrates how a person can put theory into practice. You might tell a client that an analysis of the effects of strategically withdrawing retirement funds from taxable and tax-deferred accounts can help them extend the life of their portfolio but they will have difficulty comprehending the benefit of it and almost certainly will not remember the value of that service you might provide them. But describe to them a client (real or hypothetical) who was faced with the possibility that they might outlive their savings but who worked with you to take some money out of this account and some money out of that account and legally deprived the big, bad IRS from taking any more than was absolutely necessary and you will leave an impression.</p><p> <strong>  Stories help clients deal with scary situations  </strong> &ndash; Ever work with a client who absolutely refused to discuss life insurance and risk management? It may have been because of their experience with the life insurance industry but in many cases it is because of clients&rsquo; fear of death. Pointing out that there is 100% mortality in the long run probably won&rsquo;t help. Relaying a narrative about the struggle of a family who lost a breadwinner and how, because of proper planning, they could ultimately live happily ever after may help them at least talk about the issue. Take the attention off their own mortality and present a vision past death. It is easier to discuss the problem when it is someone else who has it. Show the client that while the character in your tale could not overcome death, they helped their family survive. Stop asking them to deal with their own death and let them learn from someone else&rsquo;s.</p><p> <strong>  Similarly, some clients may have difficulty subscribing to an appropriate asset allocation because of their fear of the stock market. </strong> This fear, because it is irrational, probably cannot be resolved with an Ibbotson mountain chart. Tell them the story of an investor who stuck to a long-term strategy through 2008 and has more than recovered from that devastating market decline. G.K. Chesterton said &ldquo;Fairy tales do not tell children that dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Help your clients take the hero&rsquo;s journey. </strong>  Your clients and prospective clients face challenges. Instead of describing the services you can offer them or the skills you possess, tell them a story about someone else who, with your help, faced a similar challenge and prevailed. Help prospects envision the positive outcomes you can help them achieve. When they get to the point of feeling &ldquo;yes, yes I want to be that guy&rdquo; they will go on the adventure with you. <strong>  They may even bring their friends by telling them the same story. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Inevitably, people in the workplace are going to disagree about how, who and when the work needs to be done. When that happens, management is expected to step in. For a manager, the ability to successfully address and resolve conflict is a critical skill.</p><p> Far too often, instead of resolving conflict, managers just maintain it. The manager fails to address issues and lets the problems fester. The issues don&rsquo;t always blow up right away &mdash; but they brew and simmer below the surface, permeating and slowly poisoning workplace relationships and results.</p><p> Here are a few signs that your workplace is in a cycle of conflict maintenance.</p><li> <strong>  Gossip.  </strong> It is a sign people are upset with each other and don&rsquo;t have a proper outlet to work it out.

However, instead of speaking negatively about each other, they just stop speaking at all. They go to great lengths to prevent situations that require them to interact. When people are talking less than usual and customary, there&rsquo;s conflict maintenance at work.</li><li> <strong>  Confirmation emails. </strong>  If people are sending lots of email to confirm they&rsquo;ve completed a task or report an issue, it is a sign people don&rsquo;t trust each other and feel like they have to  cover their butt  document what is happening. That means there is conflict maintenance happening.</li><li> <strong>  Tattling. </strong>  If people are notifying management about every minor error made by others, it is a sign people are feeling frustrated with each other and believe management needs to step in and do something. That means there is conflict maintenance in the mix. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Conflict is absolutely unavoidable. </strong> If the resolution of it is handled properly, it can be an experience that leads to improvement and growth. When we spend our time practicing the art of conflict maintenance, we cause more harm than good with passive aggressive tactics.</p><p> Conflict maintenance is an art, really. It takes a lot of time, energy and effort.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://alexpirouz.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alex Pirouz  </a> </u></p><p> One of the best ways to keep your business operating successfully is by continually measuring and comparing its performance against competitor averages, a concept more formally knowing as: benchmarking.</p><p> Benchmarking is the process of comparing your business processes and performance metrics to competitor bests or, best practices from other industries. Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost.</p><p> In a business world, where things seem to change in a speed of light, more and more businesses are taking advantage of smart, industry-savvy benchmarking guides to beat competitors at their own game.</p><p> Benchmarking takes financial figures and converts them into ratios, that allows a comparison of your results to those of your competitors. Having these measures in place helps prepare businesses for taking the next step, whether it is for listing, sale or attracting new investment.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re running a coffee franchise, supermarket, a printing franchise or a financial planning company, no business is too large or, too small, to benefit from the enormous potential a detailed benchmarking analysis can provide.</p><p> In essence, business owners can use their competition as the ultimate measuring stick for improvement.</p><p> Benchmarking also helps you understand who else sells in your market. You can&rsquo;t easily describe a type of business without describing the nature of the participants.</p><p> There is a huge difference, for example, between an industry like broadband television services, in which there are only a few huge companies in any one country, and one like dry cleaning, in which there are tens of thousands of smaller participants.</p><p> This can make a big difference to a business and a business plan. The restaurant industry, for example, is what we call &ldquo;pulverised,&rdquo; which, like the dry cleaning industry, is made up of many small participants.</p><p> The fast food business, on the other hand, is composed of a few national brands participating in thousands of branded outlets, many of them franchised.</p><p> <strong>  UNDERSTANDING COMPETITORS </strong></p><p> Benchmarking can also help you understand the nature of competition in your market. This is still in the general area of describing the industry, or type of business. Explain the general nature of competition in this business, and how the customers seem to choose one provider over another. What are the keys to success? What buying factors make the most difference&ndash;Price? Product features? Service? Support? Training? Software? Delivery dates? Are brand names important?</p><p> In the computer business, for example, competition might depend on reputation and trends in one part of the market, and on channels of distribution and advertising in another.</p><p> In many business-to-business industries, the nature of competition depends on direct selling, because channels are impractical. Price is vital in products competing with each other on retail shelves, but delivery and reliability might be much more important for materials used by manufacturers in volume, for which a shortage can affect an entire production line.</p><p> In the restaurant business, for example, competition might depend on reputation and trends in one part of the market, and on location and parking in another.</p><p> As you can see, more often than not, it&rsquo;s about working smarter not harder, in order to be able to not just survive but thrive within your industry.</p><p> Financial benchmarking can provide you with the evidence you need to identify significant differences in resource management, which may suggest there is scope to do things better, to improve efficiency, reduce costs or identify potential savings.</p><p> To gain a deeper insight into the topic I recently spoke with Tim Farr, Founder of  <u>  Midpoint Wealth </u> . Midpoint Wealth specialises in helping directors of high growth companies drive their business for greater personal wealth.</p><p> Below Farr shares his top five tips when benchmarking your business:</p><p> <strong>  1. GET THE RIGHT DATA </strong></p><p> There is no other method that is as effective in assessing business performance and, that will provide you insight as to what areas need your immediate attention. It is crucial to obtain theright performance data and Key Performance Indicators for your specific industry.</p><p> Different types of businesses will have different capital requirements, operating expenses and margins of profit e.g. accounting firm vs a manufacturing plant.</p><p> This data should include both average and benchmark result (top 20 per cent) for your industry i.e. the top performers (competitors) are able to achieve</p><p> <strong>  2. DON&rsquo;T &lsquo;COOK THE BOOKS, SO TO SPEAK </strong></p><p> A common trap for most small to medium businesses is to operate their businesses financials to minimise tax. Taxable profits are good and are a clear sign of a healthy growing business.</p><p> By increasing end of year expenses to reduce taxable profit, you will adversely affect your performance ratios, business valuation, ability to attract investment, demonstrate profitability and raise capital for growth.</p><p> When comparing your figures to that of your industry, you may need to adjust your financials to reflect your business&rsquo; true commercial level of performance</p><p> <strong>  3. AIM FOR BENCHMARK </strong></p><p> No-one wants to buy, or participate in, an average business. How far off are you from performing at benchmark levels across profit, wages as percentage of salary, net return on investment etc?</p><p> Aim to achieve the same results as your industry benchmark.</p><p> <strong>  4. GET A GAME PLAN </strong></p><p> The benchmarking results will cut through like a knife, immediately revealing areas of underperformance in your business.</p><p> Then, develop your business plan specifically to &lsquo;close the gap&rsquo; between the benchmark result and your current levels of performance in each of the different areas.</p><p> <strong>  5. TIME TO TAKE ACTION </strong></p><p> Performance benching against your competitors provides powerful business and planning insight. However, knowledge without action is wasted.</p><p> If you are like most business operators that are stretched for resources, engage a creditable business advisor that will work in your business. Choose one that has the financial management expertise to implement specific improvement projects that will see your business become a benchmark business or, will help you perform better than your competition.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Shaun Frankson </u> &ndash; Co-Founder <a href=\"http://plasticbank.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Plastic Bank  </u> </a></p><h3> The world is ready for Social Plastic</h3><p> Humanity dumps 8 million metric tons of plastic into our oceans annually and that numbers is estimated to increase dramatically, according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new study  </a> </u>  published in the journal Science.</p><p> Estimating the total amount of plastic dumped into our oceans each year is no easy feat. But researchers at the University of Georgia &amp; the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) developed a model that calculated all the sources of ocean debris, and then focused specifically on plastic.</p><p> They calculate that  <strong>  275 million metric tons </strong> (MT) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with  <strong>  4.8 to 12.7 million MT </strong> entering the ocean. Jambeck and her colleagues estimate the 2015 output will be close to  <strong>  9.1 million metric tons of plastic </strong> . And by 2025, the annual cumulative output of plastic into the world&rsquo;s oceans will be around  <strong>  155 million metric tons. </strong></p><p> Thankfully, as social entrepreneurs, we see the world through a solutions focused lens. Since we are working on that particular solution every day, through The Plastic Bank and our Social Plastic movement, we have a much more optimistic view of the future.</p><p> They go on to say that &ldquo;Without waste management infrastructure improvements, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025.&rdquo;</p><p> The report states that waste estimates for 2010 for the top 20 countries ranked by mass of mismanaged plastic waste are:</p><li> China</li><li> Indonesia</li><li> Philippines</li><li> Vietnam</li><li> Sri Lanka</li><li> Thailand</li><li> Egypt</li><li> Malaysia</li><li> Nigeria</li><li> Bangladesh</li><li> South Africa</li><li> India</li><li> Algeria</li><li> Turkey</li><li> Pakistan</li><li> Brazil</li><li> Burma</li><li> Morocco</li><li> North Korea</li><li> United States</li><p> The Plastic Bank, CEO David Katz, can attest to this list after recent visits to China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Turkey and Burma, all of which made the top 20 list.</p><p> The reports goes on to say &ldquo;Our estimate of plastic waste entering the ocean is one to three orders of magnitude greater than the reported mass of floating plastic debris in high-concentration ocean gyres and also globally&rdquo;.</p><p> According to this report &ldquo;We will not reach a global &ldquo;peak waste&rdquo; before 2100. Our waste will continue to grow with increased population and increased per capita consumption associated with economic growth, especially in urban areas and developing African countries.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s interesting to see the final words of this report. &ldquo;Long-term solutions will likely include waste reduction and &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; waste management strategies such as expanded recovery systems and extended producer responsibility. Improving waste management infrastructure in developing countries is paramount and will require substantial resources and time.&rdquo; These are two keys pillars behind The Plastic Bank and our Social Plastic &reg; movement.</p><p> The more we read about ocean plastic problems, the more determined David Katz and I become to make The Plastic Bank a success. I truly believe that we can make plastic waste too valuable to end up in ocean.</p><p> The Plastic Bank is making plastic waste a currency in developing countries to help reduce global poverty and plastic waste. We offer people in need above market value for the plastic they collect and continue to build a life improvement platform for &lsquo;resource entrepreneurs&rsquo;. The plastic we collect is recycled and sold as &ldquo;Social Plastic&reg;&rdquo; to brands for use in their manufacturing as a replacement for virgin plastic. Every person can play a part in preventing plastic waste from entering our oceans. I encourage you to try to create your own business solution to solving this or another global problem. If you would like to help us solve this problem, you can ask brands to use Social Plastic &reg; instead of virgin plastic &amp; you can join the 600,000 plus people who have already helped to prove the demand for Social Plastic &reg; on Facebook. You can also officially join the social plastic movement  <u>  here </u> .</p>",

    "link": "do-we-really-need-to-teach-kids-to-code",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Once again, President Obama (who is presumably not a coder) is advocating that every child learn how to code,  <u>  <a href=\"http://recode.net/2015/02/14/obama-everybodys-got-to-learn-how-to-code/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   saying  </a> </u> :</p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have our kids in math and science, and it can&rsquo;t just be a handful of kids. It&rsquo;s got to be everybody. Everybody&rsquo;s got to learn how to code early.&rdquo;<br/> <p> The problem is, it's the right message for the wrong reasons. I suspect Obama doesn't know the first thing about what the true virtues of learning to code are. He seems to see it from the narrow, parochial, \"get a better job when you grow up\" point of view, which is blatantly fraudulent, since we ship so many coding jobs overseas. He also seems to connect STEM education, in some mysterious fashion, to future innovation. (Can you not innovate if you don't know how to code?) And the whole discussion is a swipe at teachers, which I don't like. <br/> <br/> I think it's possible to agree with the idea of teaching kids to code while also agreeing with the idea that kids ought to get more exposure to the liberal arts as well. The two are not mutually exclusive, or shouldn't be. Both are critical. <br/> <br/> But the legitimate reasons people should learn to code are not ones I hear Obama talking much about, probably because he's only dimly aware of them. Let's talk about those reasons. <br/> <br/> First, I think it's legit to learn any new language. In learning a language, you pick up new vocabulary (of words and ideas), new ways of expressing yourself, new ways of making yourself understood by others. Also, every language (even a programming language) has a Gestalt all its own, a worldview and an expressivity that's unique to the particular language. This is worth experiencing. Ironically, it's a hard thing to describe in words. If you've learned a language, you know what I'm talking about. <br/> <br/> Secondly, learning to program teaches you to think more clearly. To solve any problem in code, you have to be able to state the problem clearly. Problem definition assumes critical importance. You learn about scope. <br/> <br/> Programming is unforgiving of syntax errors, scoping errors, design errors, typing errors. You learn about debugging, which is the art of identifying flawed assumptions. We all need more of that. <br/> <br/> As a matter of sanity preservation, you learn to become detail-oriented, when you program, because only in this way can you minimize time spent debugging. This is very much a learned skill, and something everyone needs to learn. <br/> <br/> You also learn the meaning and value of  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices\" target=\"_blank\">   best practices  </a> </u> .   <br/> <br/> Programming teaches open-mindedness, by showing that there is always more than one way to reach a desired goal. There are many algorithms for sorting an array, for example. Some are fast, some are general, some bog down under edge cases; yet they all do the same thing. Selecting the best path to a solution requires weighing priorities, revisiting the problem definition, comprehending context, understanding what you're doing and why you're doing it. (Thus, it also teaches self-awareness.) <br/> <br/> Programming, if you stay with it, also teaches self-confidence. Not the phony kind that comes from false praise, but the earned kind. Feedback is immediate. Your code runs, or it doesn't; it does the required task, or it doesn't. When you write a piece of code that does what you want, brilliantly, you feel brilliant. The hard work pays off. <br/> <br/> When you become a coder, you're perfecting yourself. <br/> <br/> I don't hear much talk from the President about these matters. So I don't know whether to feel good about him advocating that kids learn to code, or not, because I don't think he gets what it's about, really. It has nothing to do with getting a better job. It has everything to do with becoming a better thinker, and thus a more complete human being. That's the part I can get behind.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> LinkedIn is the world&rsquo;s largest professional network and is a powerful tool for Advisors to help grow their business. LinkedIn has evolved into one of the most powerful marketing platforms by providing Advisors a professional ground to network, enhance their current client relationships, as well as cultivate new prospects. If you aren&rsquo;t leveraging some of the optimization features of LinkedIn, make sure you check out the  <u>  <a href=\"/fintech-center/digital-strategy/5-quick-ways-to-optimize-advisors-linkedin-profiles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Quick Ways to Optimize Advisor&rsquo;s LinkedIn Profiles  </a> </u> , before moving on. <strong>  Having a complete and optimized LinkedIn profile isn&rsquo;t enough these days. </strong> There are over 300 million active people on this professional network, which means a ton of competition. You are working hard to ensure that you are putting your businesses&rsquo; best foot forward online but in doing so, make sure you aren&rsquo;t blending in with the rest of the Financial Advisors on LinkedIn. <strong>  How do you describe yourself on LinkedIn? </strong> Do you describe yourself as &rdquo;Driven&rdquo;? Having &rdquo;Extensive Experience&rdquo;? Strategic? Motivated? These are all great traits and you may truly be all of these things.  Despite being characteristics that most people will look for in an Advisor, listing these things on your LinkedIn profile is certainly not helping you to stand out. This is because LinkedIn has analyzed its English profiles and released a list of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.linkedin.com/2015/01/21/brand-you-year-how-to-brand-yourself-without-sounding-like-everyone-else/\" target=\"_blank\">   top 10 overused buzzwords  </a> </u>  of 2014. &lsquo;&rsquo;Motivated&rsquo;&rsquo; is the most overused term in profiles while &lsquo;&rsquo;passionate&rsquo;&rsquo; is the second most commonly used word. These findings are part of LinkedIn&rsquo;s latest annual list of the most overused words and phrases on the professional network site. <strong>  Below are the top 10 global buzzwords words in order of their overuse </strong></p><li> Motivated</li><li> Passionate</li><li> Creative</li><li> Driven</li><li> Extensive experience</li><li> Responsible</li><li> Strategic</li><li> Track record</li><li> Organizational</li><li> Expert</li>Of course you are &lsquo;&rsquo;motivated&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&rsquo;responsible&rsquo;&rsquo; &ndash; these are key descriptions that everyone feels they need to convey, but the problem is, the more they are used, the less impact they have. A great start to making your profile stand out is to remove these buzzwords from your profile. LinkedIn suggests that simply replacing these buzzwords with words from your thesaurus isn&rsquo;t going to cut it.<strong> The most effective strategy, LinkedIn explains, is replacing these buzzwords with examples that illustrate how you&rsquo;re motivated, and how you are strategic, and what your extensive experience involves.</strong> How has your motivation helped clients receive results? How has your passion helped clients to meet their goals? Instead of falling back on empty terminology, use concrete examples and results to highlight your accomplishments. Share your achievements in the context of your company, career, and professional growth, rather than making it sound like you think you are bragging.",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  I&rsquo;m pretty sure one of the top 10 things I hear from advisors is, &ldquo;None of my clients use this social media stuff.&rdquo; </strong>  And&hellip;I&rsquo;m pretty sure they are wrong.  (Really?  I mean, there&rsquo;s a billion active users on Facebook today.  I think I have a good shot at being right on this one &ndash; just saying&hellip;)</p><p> The one thing advisors have available to them is their book of business.  The data collected over years (decades!) can be staggering and most advisors use a CRM (client relationship management) software package to manage this data. So I have to ask, &ldquo;Are you mining your data?&rdquo;</p><p> I recently read in the Wall Street Journal that Peter Hancock (the incoming CEO of American International Group, Inc.) is banking on turning  <u>  <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/aigs-new-ceo-looks-to-data-to-chart-insurers-course-1409328464\" target=\"_blank\">   data into dollars  </a> </u> .  [On a side note, I have to bet that John Hancock Life Insurance is thinking, &ldquo;Hancock is running AIG!?&rdquo;  Insurance humor&hellip;]  As the article reads, Hancock expects the results will include new products, better identification of fraud and potentially lower-premiums for certain customers.</p><p> This got me to thinking.  If data mining is good enough for a gigantic insurance company to use as part of their strategy &ndash; and that&rsquo;s a lot of data, folks &ndash; then shouldn&rsquo;t data mining be on your radar for 2015 and beyond? Absa-freaking-lutely!</p><p> <strong>  Going back and revisiting clients is just good business sense </strong> , but so many are so busy looking at the next rung, the next deal and the next elephant to remember the clients they helped so many years ago with their planning.  Good advisors are reaching back out on occasion here or there, great advisors are enormous givers and have systematic ways of staying in touch with lots of people.  Social media can really help with this.</p><p> Where compliance allows [for those registered reps who read my blog] connecting on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. with your clients allows you to see so much more of who your client REALLY is and what is REALLYimportant to them.  These social signals are invaluable to maintaining not only your book of business, but your credibility, care and courage as an advisor.  Becoming more than someone&rsquo;s financial planner, you are surrounded by your clients as their friends and meet others who are most important to them.  Combining this social activity with the data in your CRM and you will be light years ahead of many advisors out there.</p><p> There is no exact science to data mining, but there are results that are consistent across many organizations that are doing it well.  Recognizing birthdays, anniversaries, etc. is a simple, yet effective, use of data that will help you stay in front of clients.  Being on top of your game though with watching windows on annuities, term conversions, different needs for coverage laddering, etc. is where you will boost profitability within your business.</p><p> <strong>  I have two words for you:  Data Mining.  Learn it.  Live it.  Love it. </strong></p><p> Make your day bigger, better and more BIONIC!</p>",

    "content": "<p> In late 2014, we produced a white paper,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dnnsoftware.com/resources/whitepapers/top-trends-in-web-cms-for-2015/view/whitepaper?utm_source=dnn-blog&amp;utm_medium=text-link&amp;utm_campaign=dnn-blog-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top Trends for Web CMS in 2015  </a> </u> . It was fun to be able to pontificate on what lies ahead for Web CMS. We had so much fun, in fact, that we wanted to do a webinar on the same topic in early 2015.</p><p> And here we are in early 2015.</p><p> Before we got here, I had to find someone to present the webinar.  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piewords\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Laurence Hart  </a> </u>  was recommended as someone with deep industry experience, who could speak in depth about Web CMS trends. So I promptly set out to contact Laurence and was delighted when he said he was interested.</p><p> VIEW the on-demand replay:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11085/139937\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top Trends for Web CMS in 2015 [WEBINAR]  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  Top Trends in Web CMS for 2015 </strong></p><p> I had the pleasure of moderating Laurence&rsquo;s webinar. I then put together the following summary, based on my viewing of the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11085/139937\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   webinar&rsquo;s on-demand replay  </a> </u> . Laurence covered six trends for Web CMS in 2015.</p><p> <strong>  1) FROM MOBILE FIRST TO ALWAYS RESPONSIVE </strong></p><p> &ldquo;When you go to Philadelphia, you have to see the Liberty Bell. When you design a website, you have to be responsive.\"</p><p> In other words, building web experiences for mobile visitors is a must. </p><p> According to Laurence, however, the notion of mobile sites and desktop sites is a thing of the past. Today, and in 2015, it&rsquo;s just one site that flows across all mobile experiences.</p><p> Think of water, said Laurence. Whether you pour water into a cup or a bottle, it fills the space: water poured into a cup becomes the cup. Content on your website is like water, and the cups and bottles are the devices visitors use to experience your content.</p><p> Web CMS systems must enable and support this process of being responsive. Marketers must use their Web CMS to build experiences where content fills the device, whether it be a desktop, tablet or smartphone. If you don&rsquo;t follow through on this in 2015, your website will be left far behind.</p><p> <strong>  2) WEB IS JUST PART OF THE EXPERIENCE </strong></p><p> Yes, your Web CMS manages your website. But in 2015 and beyond, it needs to do much, much more. A Web CMS should be supplemented with data (that resides outside of the Web CMS) to give you a 360 degree view of the customer.</p><p> What are some examples? Data on:</p><li> Offline purchases</li><li> Customer inquiries</li><li> Interactions with customers in an online customer community</li><li> Technical support cases opened by the customer <br/>  </li><p> Let&rsquo;s say a customer recently logged five trouble tickets with your customer support team. One was resolved, but four are &ldquo;open&rdquo; and marked as high priority. If that customer were to visit your website, would you treat her the same as an anonymous visitor? Or, would you keep showing that &ldquo;renew your subscription now&rdquo; offer, knowing about the four open trouble tickets?</p><p> DOWNLOAD the white paper:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dnnsoftware.com/resources/whitepapers/top-trends-in-web-cms-for-2015/view/whitepaper?utm_source=dnn-blog&amp;utm_medium=text-link&amp;utm_campaign=dnn-blog-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top Trends in Web CMS for 2015  </a> </u></p><p> Web CMS systems need to facilitate Customer Experience Management by integrating data from outside sources. Then, with this data, Web CMS systems need to help facilitate content that&rsquo;s tailored to each customer.</p><p> <strong>  3) SOCIAL MEDIA WITH A PURPOSE </strong></p><p> Social media used to be considered a destination. You created a Facebook Page and invited all of your customers to engage with you there. In 2015, social media is longer the &ldquo;end.&rdquo; Think of it more as a means to an end. Social media is an important distribution vehicle to drive interest and traffic to your owned and managed properties (e.g. website, branded online community).</p><p> <u>  Nate Elliott </u> , Principal Analyst at Forrester Research, shared similar thoughts in a blog post titled &ldquo; <u>  As Social Media Matures, Branded Communities Will Make A Comeback In 2015 </u> .&rdquo; According to Elliott, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for marketers to focus their efforts on the social tactics that actually work.&rdquo; And what&rsquo;s working is the use of social media to drive traffic to your website and other owned media destinations.</p><p> <strong>  4) ANALYTICS CREATING ACTIONS </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/analytics-creating-actions.png\" width=\"625\"/>  </p><p> Are you a baseball fan who likes to crunch batting averages, on-base percentages and related statistics, to determine which players are most valuable to a team? </p><p> If so, you may be just the right person to work with your organization&rsquo;s web analytics.</p><p> More and more in 2015, organizations will analyze and interpret web analytics data to drive meaningful and tangible business results. </p><p> They might discover a web page that drives the majority of their sales leads, or find a &ldquo;dead end&rdquo; from which many visitors are navigating no further.</p><p> In line with this trend, Web CMS systems must provide easy access to this data and deliver it in a way that enables marketers to drive action from them.</p><p> <strong>  5) CLOUD IS A VIABLE OPTION </strong></p><p> Laurence was formerly CIO at AIIM, the Association for Information and Image Management, so it was telling to hear him say, &ldquo;I don't want to manage my hardware or software, I want to manage my website.&rdquo; According to Laurence, Web CMS systems delivered via the cloud are a viable option in 2015.</p><p> VIEW the on-demand replay:  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11085/139937\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top Trends for Web CMS in 2015 [WEBINAR]  </a> </u></p><p> In other words, rather than managing your own infrastructure (facilities, servers, operating systems, applications software, networking hardware and bandwidth), customers can run their Web CMS in the cloud, either with a cloud provider, or, directly with the Web CMS vendor&rsquo;s cloud offering.</p><p> Before deciding on a cloud solution, Laurence highly recommends asking the provider for references, as well as investigating the security of their service. In addition, ensure that you have an &ldquo;exit plan,&rdquo; or a way to access and download all of your website data, should you need to move to another provider.</p><p> <strong>  6) IMPROVED USER INTERFACES AND USER EXPERIENCES </strong></p><p> If you were presenting a &ldquo;top trends on Web CMS&rdquo; five or ten years ago, you could talk about new features that vendors were shipping. But given where we are, every vendor has an equivalent set of product features. In other words, we all have what everyone else has.</p><p> So how to differentiate yourself in 2015? The user interface and user experience, says Laurence. Web CMS systems need to deliver the necessary features in way that&rsquo;s intuitive and easy. As customers evaluate Web CMS vendors in 2015, they&rsquo;ll start to choose solutions that provide the best user experience. Usability will become more important than price and features.</p>",

    "link": "are-we-saying-f-you-to-guarding-employee-data",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Over the past year, year and a half, data breaches have surged substantially. </strong></p><p> Target, Michael&rsquo;s, and Neiman Marcus have all been impacted by customer data breaches, and now  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.longisland.com/news/09-09-14/home-depot-payment-data-breach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Home Depot  </a> </u>  customers are experiencing the same thing. The funny thing I have witnessed as these events continue to occur is our level of acceptance has increased. It appears that while these situations are frustrating, we are now accepting these &ldquo;breaches&rdquo; as somewhat being a new norm and our reaction to the impact has become desensitized. I do not believe this desensitization is purposeful, but with retailers and credit card companies alike trying to do right by consumers, I think it is becoming a risk we know is there and we will get through it.</p><p> The question I am ask myself on the flip side to these consumer breaches is, &ldquo;do we have that same desensitization of our personal data with our employers?&rdquo; Is it a bigger deal if our personal data &ndash; social security number, birth date, etc. &ndash; was stolen versus our credit card number? I would like to think many people would say yes. However, did you know that personnel data breaches continue to be on the rise? Employers like  <u>  UPMC </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://news.techworld.com/security/3499054/coca-cola-suffers-data-breach-after-employee-borrows-55-laptops/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Coca-Cola  </a> </u> , and  <a href=\"http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/employee-gaffes-cause-two-HIPAA-data-breaches\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   others  </u>    </a> have been the subject of employee data being breached, it just doesn&rsquo;t seem like we hear about these breaches as much.</p><p> <strong>  Many of the issues of employee data breaches are the result of employee themselves. Yes, employees themselves. </strong> What you will find is that many times employee data is leaked by accident through simple sharing of information to the wrong person &ndash; either internally or externally. In other cases, breaches are caused through network exposure of employees visiting personal sites or visiting sites which promote hackers to try to break in.</p><p> So while we all want to grip and complain when our employers block website access or use of thumb drives, there is a reason for this. Many IT departments are protecting us from ourselves because when we access these sites or use a thumb drive (we unknowingly has a virus on it), we are creating an opportunity of exposure. Therefore, in situations where organizations are now releasing blocks to web or website access or allowing use of unauthorized thumb drives, are we giving the middle finger to protecting employee data?</p><p> Are we continuing to give the middle finger to protecting employee data when controls become even more lax on sharing data internally? Meaning, are we still able to share key personnel data without data and/or email encryption? Or better yet, do we still trust that we can leave documents sitting around on our desks and trust people will not take them?</p><p> As someone who was the victim of identity theft by result of a manager taking my documents I presented for my I-9 and creating her own documents with her name, employee data protection is something I am attuned to. And it is something I think every working professional should be, as well!</p><p> Now I do not recommend going on any rampage of locking down data or web access, but I think it is worth wild as a professional in an organization to get a better understanding of how data is accessed, used, and shared. Some questions I generally ask myself, include:</p><li> What are the methods for encryption?</li><li> What information is readily shared?</li><li> Is information shared that doesn&rsquo;t have to be shared?</li><li> Are physical documents secured appropriately to provide double protection?</li><li> What is the accepted behavior on sharing data?</li><li> Do people appear to have a care on protecting data? <br/>  </li><p> Since most employee data within organizations is housed with the HR team, HR professionals have to take to heart on how to protect employee information. Ensuring documents are locked up or guarded is key &ndash; do not leave papers lying around with sensitive information assuming someone will not take it or look to see what is on the document simply because they are in HR.</p><p> <strong>  Ensure personnel records are double secured &ndash; meaning locked filed cabinets in a locked room. </strong> It still amazes me when I go to some organizations and the assumption again is that because it is the HR file room, no one will attempt to gain access unauthorized. While I would say this is 98% true, risks still exist and it is important to be aware of those risks. Furthermore, ensure HRIS systems provide layered security and encryption and offer security mechanisms to limit idle open sessions, etc.</p><p> Security is a means of awareness and execution; it is something organizations have to embed within their cultures as technology continues to evolve. So if you are a professional in an organization, next time you go to send that email with confidential information or have a documents lying around with confidential information, be mindful of how you are protecting the information you have access too. Otherwise, you can simply say you are saying F*** You to safeguarding anything.</p>",

    "link": "the-side-effects-of-pension-envy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> In working with retired parents and their adult children, I've grown used to the comment that children have about how they \"wished they had a pension like Mom or Dad had.\"</strong>This condition that I call \"<u> <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-have-pension-envy-2013-02-04\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  pension envy </a></u>\" is due to the perception of having the \"safety net\" of a pension, or defined-benefit retirement plan, rather than a 401(k)-based retirement plan that provides no \"defined benefit\" and takes that plan participant on a roller-coaster ride of market fluctuations. The allure of the pension was also due to its ability to clearly define what a person would earn when they retire, something that's difficult to do with plans like 401(k)s.However, the pension option that made up the sole retirement plan for so many in past generations, has disappeared for the majority of Americans. Being \"on your own\" with 401(k) plans and IRAs have become the replacement models for retirement plans as companies moved away from pension plans and placed those retirement responsibilities onto the workers. In reality, these options have allowed for greater investment flexibility and for many, higher returns and larger nest eggs than they would have had in a pension.For others, it has provided an account that they have used to \"skim off\" assets for non-retirement needs (paying bills, vacations, boats, etc.) or a Las Vegas type of account where they have placed their savings in high-risk investments and depleted their account values. As I said, this model for retirement provides an \"on your own\" approach and when left to one's own devices, bad decisions are often made.The insecurity that many feel about their own retirement brings back feelings of envy when they encounter workers, mainly of those in the public sector, who still have access to a pension plan that allows them to plan for their income levels in retirement. These feelings often go beyond just envy, and result in anger toward those with pensions when people recognize that having pensions, primarily for public workers, comes with a cost, not to the employer, but to the average taxpayer (that's me and you). I've <u> <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pensions-americas-great-divide-2013-02-11\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  written about this on this site in the past </a></u>, but new research figures point out just how strongly Americans currently feel about this issue.A <u> <a href=\"https://reason.com/2015/02/06/february-2015-reason-rupe-pension-poll/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recent study </a></u> by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, the same firm that does the Pew polls, shows that Americans are concerned about the burdens that public pensions are placing on state and local governments and feel that changes are needed, most of which don't include raising taxes to pay for increased pension costs for public workers.<strong> The study shows that:</strong>&mdash; 82% of Americans favor requiring current public employees to contribute more toward their own future pensions and benefits.&mdash; 78% of Americans say taxpayers should get to vote on pension increases for government employees.&mdash; 72% of Americans are concerned their state and local governments may not be able to afford public employee pensions.<strong> The study also shows that Americans are less interested in burdening current retirees than they are in seeing solutions for those who will be new hires and eligible for pensions:</strong>&mdash; 71% of Americans oppose reducing pension benefits that are currently being paid to already-retired public employees&mdash; 67% of Americans favor shifting future public employees, those who haven't been hired yet, from guaranteed defined-benefit pensions to 401(k)-style retirement accounts.&mdash; 59% of Americans favor shifting current public employees to a 401(k)-style retirement system, but only 38% of Americans support transitioning current public employees from guaranteed pensions to 401(k)-style retirement accounts if it means breaking contracts with existing workers.I think that these numbers show that Americans have \"pension envy\" but they also show respect for workers and the benefits that they already have, and they value the relationship between public workers and state and local governments.It's clear that there's a need for solutions when discussing the burdens of pensions on the taxpayer, but it's also good to recognize that on this issue, creating safe retirements for all workers is something that affects all of us. And along with that comes respect for each other, regardless of the type of retirement plan we have.",

    "title": "Entrepreneurs — 4 Vital Questions to Ask/Answer!",
    "link": "entrepreneurs-4-vital-questions-to-ask-answer",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Entrepreneurs and understandably passionate and eager to start their new business and, from my experience, it is difficult to get their attention once they have decided to launch. </strong>   But, for the opportunity to blossom into a startup, secure funding, and realize its full potential a few \"procedural\" details should be rigorously followed.  Here are my four most important questions to ask and answer first before significant investment in time, energy, and personal finance are committed.</p><li> Does any other person or entity own this idea, invention, or innovation?</li><li> Is there a significant market for products or services to be performed?</li><li> Is there a business model that makes sense; that is, can the business be profitable?</li><li> Can I write a persuasive business plan? <br/>  </li><p> Let me explain my answers to these questions. </p><p> <strong>  1. Does any other person or entity own this idea, invention, or innovation? </strong></p><p> An idea by itself is not legally protectable unless kept as a trade secret (and not made public somewhere else) and even then another person or entity may come up with the same idea thus negating its value as a trade secret. An idea should drive further thought and, ideally, the creation of an innovation, a way of solving a new or existing problem differently and in a better way.  The innovation should manifest itself, for instance, as a product that offers improved benefits or profitability. The innovation may also be a new or improved service or manufacturing process. The innovation must involve the development of technology that is new and unique.  Innovations are best secured in the form of a patent though some may be better preserved as a trade secret. For something to be patentable it must satisfy a number of requirements (the subject of another blog), but the patent basically describes an invention.  Patents are property and assets and offer important legal rights and protections for its owner. <br/> <br/> The inventor/entrepreneur must be absolutely certain that any technology to be developed based on the idea, invention, or innovation is unique and provides the underpinning needed for securing legal protections (e.g., patents, software that may be kept as a trade secret, or perhaps copyrighted).  This means the entrepreneur and patent attorney must perform a good amount of due diligence on technology and patents before having certainty that the answer must be NO in order to proceed. <br/> <br/> Looking forward, if an entrepreneur anticipates taking-in professional money, then it should be expected that investors will diligently research competitive technology positions especially the patent landscape. For investment, the technology and legal positions (both current and anticipated) must be robust &ndash; reducing technology risk to near-zero is a prerequisite for investment.</p><p> The answer to Question #1 must be NO.</p><p> <strong>  2.  Is there a significant market for products to be made or services to be provided? </strong></p><p> One of the more difficult issues for entrepreneurs to address relates to target markets and potential sales revenue.</p><p> It is critical at the earliest stage of planning and due diligence by founders to determine those markets (e.g., the target markets) that are sufficiently large and growing that they would support the entry of a new competitor (the entrepreneur&rsquo;s new venture). Professional investors generally insist that target markets be large and growing so that missteps and errors on the part of the new venture can somewhat be compensated by the size of the market which presumably contains large competitors who are not particularly concerned with competing with a small, up-start, technology company. Nevertheless, venture capital firms, in particular, are interested in supporting companies that target billion dollar markets rather than those that target million dollar markets. Both the magnitude of investment considered and the interest of professional investors scale with the size of the markets to be served by the underlying technology.</p><p> The goal for an entrepreneur is to identify a number of potential target markets that collectively (in a summed sense) have a large size, presumably in the billions of dollars range. One of these target markets will eventually be selected as the entry market &mdash; that market that offers the best prospect for producing profit soon after funding. That initial target market need not be large, but it must be one for which success is highly probable.</p><p> The weakest part of any business plan will be the projection of sales revenue. Investors, for good reasons, dissect sales numbers and also carefully study the rationale behind the projections. The inability of the entrepreneur to adequately explain or validate how sales will be accomplished gives investors the opportunity to discount proposed valuations. The entrepreneur is usually ill-prepared to defend the business plan in the absence of a good, if not excellent, marketing and sales strategy and plan.</p><p> For a new venture without any evidence of sales, sales revenue needs to be projected using a combination of provable data about the markets and assumptions and judgments about how prospects are converted into customers. These assumptions and judgments will still be examined closely by investors but they are more defensible and subject to testing (surveys, focus group, for instance) at early stages by the new venture. With early testing, sales projections become more credible and less subject to discounting by investors. This provides a pathway for entrepreneurs to argue for greater pre-money valuations.</p><p> The answer to Question #2 must be YES. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3.   Is there a business model that makes sense; that is, can the business be profitable? </strong></p><p> Simply put, the business model describes how the company intends to make money and become sustainably profitable. It could also be said that the business model describes how the company will develop and deliver value to its customers, employees, and investors. Eventually, the full description of the business model will reside in the various elements of the business plan. The business model need not be fully expanded or given a label during the formative period of the company; however, the founders need to have an understanding of how their particular technology and products are going to be developed and sold into their selected markets.</p><p> Competitors exist in any market targeted by the new venture. By studying competitor models, entrepreneurs can gain an appreciation of how organizational details are deployed by other companies to enable them to create revenue, profit, and satisfied customers. Founders need to deeply understand the competitive landscape.</p><p> The analysis of the competitive landscape, along with a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis, prepares the founders to define the business model and identify the major elements of the strategic plan, starting with a delineation of the envisioned company&rsquo;s unique competitive advantage (UCA) that the founders believe will enable their new venture to become successful (e.g., outperform their competitors).  A UCA is simply that unique advantage the new venture has in comparison to competitors in the market. Of course, the UCA, along with other strategic actions that may be created, can only be anticipated during the early stages of the new venture; however, a proper business model and strategic plan enable the founders to develop a convincing message that will be read and heard by investors in the near future.</p><p> Once the UCA is identified, it is a valuable exercise to consider the other organizational functions of the business and how they will be designed and implemented to support a sustainable UCA. A sustainable UCA, as it implies, provides a rational basis for presuming the new venture can become a lasting and valuable company.</p><p> More information about the early thinking in regards to the business model is provided in an earlier post on LinkedIn  <u>  http://tinyurl.com/m9v8k48 </u> .</p><p> The answer to Question #3 must be YES.</p><p> <strong>  4.  Can I write a persuasive business plan? </strong></p><p> A persuasive business plan is one in which investors are induced/convinced that the business opportunity is good and investment should be made.  Putting aside personal dynamics and intervening presentations, the written word (e.g., the business plan) will undergo scrutiny from investors in the supporting team of accountants and advisors.  So, the business plan must carry the message in the absence of the entrepreneurial team. </p><p> The business plan must be based on facts and data which lead to conclusions and reductions to actions that can be executed in a logical and intelligent fashion.  Those attributes must be reflected in the written business plan in a convincing fashion.  Preparing the logical organization of the business plan along with the words (in the form of paragraphs) is a challenge for any of us.</p><p> In a previous blog (How to Overcome the Hesitancy to Write Your Business Plan   <u>  <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/lcblj2g\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://tinyurl.com/lcblj2g  </a> </u> ), I explained how to get started.  I have written many funded business plans for others over the years and that is the process I also follow. Finally, I refer entrepreneurs to my new book which provides details about how to go about the process of starting your business as well as building the business plan.</p><p> Surely, presentations and personal statements are very important, but at the end of the day it is imperative that the business plan be persuasive.</p><p> The answer to Question #4 is \"YES.\"</p>",

Being in receipt of excellent ideas should always be welcome. </p><p> The following sales strategies apply both to those seeking new jobs as well as those aspiring to grow their business.</p><p> <strong>  1. Answer, &ldquo;why should I care?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Providing a program you know your target audience needs, wants and desires, is part one of fulfilling an important sales mantra.  But part two has to answer the question of why the individual should care.</p><p> The only reason someone or a corporation will buy into a solution in any format is because they have a problem that needs to be resolved.  Before you can sell your product or service, or even yourself on an interview, you have to understand the pain points of the other and the added ramifications.</p><p> <strong>  2. Speak to why they should care </strong></p><p> Are you able to empower others with productivity and effectiveness, reduce expense, or increase their ROI?  These examples answer problems of pain points and will definitely speak to why they should care.  Now you will have gained their attention. </p><p> <strong>  3. Belief and Trust </strong></p><p> If what you have is so powerful, you will need to prove your statements, without sounding egotistical.  State the facts, and be specific.  Do you have powerful testimonials on your behalf, statistics backing your claim, recognition, and/or awards?  Are these reflected on your profile pages and website? </p><p> Your information needs to be posted and seen multiple times over for the belief and trust to take hold. </p><p> <strong>  4. Branding </strong></p><p> Using the advice of Step #3, you will soon be building an effective branding campaign.  The more people who see your activity and in a variety of formats, the greater the credibility you have. </p><p> This is where all of the steps come together to attract the audience you desire.  It is because you hit the caring, and they desire to learn more.</p><p> <strong>  5. Sales </strong></p><p> Rather than diving into the sale when you are contacted, inquire first with, &ldquo;What caught your attention most that motivated you to speak with me?&rdquo; </p><p> The question produces client feedback that will further empower your effort and will help you to achieve the  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Smooth Sale  </u>  ! </a></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.gscpa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lionel Sanders  </a> </u></p><p> Should you buy art as an investment?  It is a good question, and one that merits some careful consideration.  Although I love art, my job as the accountant is to advise my clients regarding the tax ramifications and keep them compliant with the tax rules. But sometimes clients need a sounding board so my general advice breaks down into these key points:</p><p> <strong>  1. Love Your Art </strong></p><p> Only buy art if you enjoy it. Part of the allure of buying art is being able to enjoy the piece on a day to day basis.  Your investment may hang on your wall for quite a while, so you need to really enjoy looking at it.  Remember to consider your spouse in this decision, as they will also be looking at it daily.  I have accumulated a collection of art that stays in my office merely because I purchased pieces that did not appeal to my wife however I like the work.</p><p> <strong>  2. Be an Educated Art Buyer </strong></p><p> Do your research. Especially if you buy art for an investment, you should understand the artist and the art market.  You have to research the market and educate yourself before you acquire art as an investment. The approach to art should be the same as if you were investing in the stock market or in real estate.  If you found a piece of real estate that you absolutely loved, you would consult a real estate agent to get comparable sales information for similar properties, and their advice would help you determine how much you want to pay for it.   You would go through inspections and research the title.  The same principals should be applied to a prospective art purchase. Join a museum to educate yourself on many different artists and to find trends in art. Attend the events the museums have during the year. It can be fun and rewarding at the same time. Your cost of joining a museum can be a charitable contribution to the art institution. A good way to learn about art for investment purposes is to find galleries who specialize in art that may appeal to you.  The gallery staff can share knowledge of current trends, and can show you works that have a similar feel to ones you are considering.  Museums docents are also a good source of information about particular periods in art so take the tours that they give at the museum.  This acquired knowledge can be a huge benefit in narrowing your choices with a purchase of art. Attend gallery openings and talk to the artist about their work. After all, the artist is there to sell their work and you could be a potential buyer. Do not be afraid to talk to the gallery director and the artist. You are at the event to learn about the art and the artist. But remember, even if you find a gallery you like and let them guide you on what and how to buy, do not do it for investment unless you know the subject and you believe in the work of the artist.  It&rsquo;s like the stock market, if you don&rsquo;t know about what you&rsquo;re buying, don&rsquo;t buy it.</p><p> <strong>  3. Keep an Art Paper Trail   </strong></p><p> Keep adequate records. Trace the source of the art and the trail of ownership also known as the provenance. When you finally take the leap and buy the piece that has been calling to you, make sure you keep records of the purchase and any costs involved.  The general rule is to keep tax records for five to seven years, except if the records relate to an asset that you still own.  If you ever sell the piece of art, you will need evidence of the monies spent on this investment.  This would include the original purchase receipts, costs for delivery, framing, storing or moving the piece, or the cost of any restoration work.</p><p> <strong>  4. Protect Your Prized Possession Insure your investment.  </strong></p><p> Once you have made the decision to buy the art, you should not neglect to insure the new asset.  Fine art can represent an important investment for you and it makes sense to have that investment insured.  Going back to the comparison with real estate, you would not own a building without having insurance on that building.  Do not make this mistake with your important fine art purchase. Fine art and collectible insurance is not expensive when it comes to protecting your investment. The insurance usually includes as part of the policy earthquake and theft coverage with no deductible if you should have to file a claim for a loss. Be sure to consult with an insurance broker that understands fine art and collectible insurance coverage. Some of my clients use art insurance as the hedge against the deducible portion of the earthquake insurance on their home in case of a catastrophic loss. If you are careful and consider these points, investing in art can be a very rewarding experience.  You can enjoy your piece while it may appreciate in value.  Or you may find that you love your art enough that selling is no longer a consideration.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Comparison is the thief of joy.&rdquo; </strong> It&rsquo;s a fact we all know too well. But not all comparisons look like envy of others. The most subtle, yet equally challenging rivalry is the one we have with ourselves.</p><p> We&rsquo;re in one place and we&rsquo;d like to be in another. Or, we'd like to skip ahead to the point in time when we imagine everything to be amazing.</p><li> Maybe you've started a business and you&rsquo;re frustrated that it isn&rsquo;t successful yet.</li><li> Maybe you&rsquo;re in a relationship and it&rsquo;s not moving on your timeline.</li><li> Or maybe you&rsquo;re exercising and you&rsquo;re not seeing the results you&rsquo;d like. <br/>  </li><p> I get it. I&rsquo;ve been there. When I first started Aligned Holistics, I was pretty na&iuml;ve. I thought it would be an instantaneous &ldquo;I&rsquo;m living my life&rsquo;s purpose so the cash will flow in.&rdquo; And it did, but certainly not on my timeline and definitely not in the way I originally envisioned.</p><p> See, my concept of what the business would look like was based on my two very different notions: my spiritual beliefs and Facebook. I thought it would be all pictures of green juice and beach vacations. More often than not, it&rsquo;s coffee and skyping clients while secretly wearing pajama pants.</p><p> I was beating myself up over what I thought things &ldquo;should&rdquo; look like. I started to panic, &ldquo;If this were truly my purpose, wouldn&rsquo;t I already be successful? Maybe I&rsquo;m not cut out for this.&rdquo;</p><p> The truth is that there isn&rsquo;t a single entrepreneur I know who hasn&rsquo;t, at one time or another, cried on the bathroom floor and questioned everything. Thankfully, I was willing to ask for help, work hard, and try new things.</p><p> <strong>  Now, I&rsquo;m in a completely different place: </strong></p><li> I&rsquo;m successful and happy.</li><li> I have incredible clients whom I love working with.</li><li> I sometimes wear non-pajama pants during sessions. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  What I came to realize was that there wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with my faith in myself and my purpose. I needed to learn how to: </strong></p><li> Reach out and ask for help.</li><li> Try things that scared the shit out of me.</li><li> To shut my ego up.</li><li> Embrace the beauty of uncertainty.</li><li> To have faith in a timeline that I couldn&rsquo;t control. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s frustrating when you&rsquo;re creating something and it isn&rsquo;t where you want it to be. I went from being a perfectionist who&rsquo;d get stuck and never execute to learning to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s good enough for now.&rdquo;</p><p> The truth is that movement is the key to getting from one place to another. Sounds obvious, but if you want to get from where you are to the Oprah-like-equivalent of your field, that&rsquo;s going to take action. It&rsquo;s going to take ups, downs, wins, and fails. And eventually the gap between where you are and where you&rsquo;d like to be will start to narrow.</p><p> <strong>  When you&rsquo;re creating something, you&rsquo;re in a state of creating until it&rsquo;s created. </strong></p><p> <strong>  THE TAKEAWAY: </strong></p><p> The key to changing your relationship with time is to trust it. Stop comparing your beginning to someone else&rsquo;s middle (or your ideal). It will all work out in its own beautiful and frustratingly non-linear way.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  What happens if sales don't happen? </strong></p><p> Usually, panic.  And panic leads to more panic.  When sales don't happen, very often the CEO thinks s/he needs to step in, especially in a consultative sales environment where the sales cycle is typically longer. Then you have situations in which CEOs are doing the sales training, or CEOs being on first sales calls and getting involved in everything and anything that has to do with sales. They fear for their company&rsquo;s survival and that's understandable.</p><p> And what about the sales managers in these situations? Well, as there is no success to show they often panic as well. In these cases they often just give in and let their CEOs take over instead of putting their feet down and demanding to stay on track.  They tend to go along with their CEOs rather than providing clear measures, guidelines and leading developments in the sales process.</p><p> This can have a snowball effect on the sales team. The sales people might fear that they could lose their job or that they won't be making any money.</p><p> The sales managers do both. They panic and fear, both for their team, for their compensation and for their reputation.</p><p> <strong>  Why don't the sales managers keep their CEO in check? </strong></p><p> I have always wondered in situations like that why sales manager wouldn't stick to their guns? Is it because there aren&rsquo;t not enough sales managers who are really confident enough and able to make a case for a structured and meaningful sales process?</p><p> Or is it because CEOs are used to being powerful leaders and end up steamrolling their team? Or could it be that CEOs are not always good at allowing other opinions?</p><p> It really depends on the specific situation, but I have seen both. I have seen some CEOs being so impressed with themselves that they can't tolerate another opinion. But in all fairness, I have seen more CEOs just lost and not knowing what to do other than to take control.</p><p> <strong>  Sales Managers, you need to manage your CEOs, too! </strong></p><p> Sales managers are tasked with building and managing an effective and successful sales team. To be most successful, though, you will need to build an effective and successful relationship with your CEO. That includes open and full communication, documentation and also managing your CEOs. Embracing the CEO&rsquo;s vision but also making sure your CEO embraces the sales process you put in place.</p><p> <strong>  What is the solution? </strong></p><p> Stay calm and on-track. If you have a plan, success will follow it might just take a bit longer. It's better to wait a month or two as oppose to changing everything and getting derailed completely. When I was managing a sales team I never allowed my CEOs to dictate the sales process, but then again I took all the steps to ensure my CEOs understood and embraced the process. When it comes to sales, sales people and managers need to manage up. CEOs often don't have a background in sales management, so help them understand the process, manage expectations and stay positive!</p>",

    "link": "4-questions-you-must-ask-before-creating-your-startups-corporate-identity-design",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> Corporate identity design has been an integral element of business since the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/07/06/the-evolution-of-the-logo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   early 1900s  </a> </u> . But despite the effect that the right branding and design can have for a company or a campaign, sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult to see its true value laid out on a mock-up.</p><p> To the untrained eye, it looks a lot like a logo and a color palette rather than a compelling and convincing extension of a company&rsquo;s offering.</p><p> But the power of corporate identity design is just that: the impression and feeling a certain design can give to the untrained eye of your customer when the time comes to make a purchasing decision.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s why companies spend anywhere from $1,000 to $1,000,000 creating a consistent, meaningful, and effective corporate identity design before going to market.</p><p> Startups may not have the history and funding to require that kind of identity investment, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean your corporate identity design isn&rsquo;t just as important.</p><p> Here are four questions you must ask before you develop your initial corporate identity design:</p><p> <strong>  1. What problem do we solve for our customer? </strong></p><p> Every piece of branding for your company, from content to video to images, needs to begin with this question.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/solve-b2b-sales-problems-buyer-personas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The problem you solve for your customer  </a> </u>  speaks to so many motivations: why they&rsquo;re on your website, why they&rsquo;re reading your content, what they&rsquo;re hoping to get out of your content, and more.</p><p> Understanding the context of the problem you solve for your customer will allow you to identify images, colors, and stylistic elements that fit into their mental landscape. The deeper your understanding of your customer&rsquo;s problem and how your startup&rsquo;s solution meets that need, the more appropriate and appealing your design choices will be.</p><p> <strong>  2. How do we want our customer to feel when they first see our brand? </strong></p><p> Your first impression is important because most website visitors make a decision about your product or website  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/bad-websites-lose-visitors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   within 10 seconds  </a> </u> . You also need to build a look that can be immediately recognizable as you build your brand and gain more customers through word of mouth.</p><p> But the important thing to focus on is the emotional response of your customer&rsquo;s first look at your branding. Identifying the feelings you want your customer to feel when they first see your brand will help you rule out different styles and trends that may feel right now but won&rsquo;t impress or attract your customer at first glance.</p><p> This is true even in IT and manufacturing companies. The scientific and rational is important, but &ldquo;your culture and emotion play into customer choice, too&rdquo; as one of our clients so eloquently put it.</p><p> <strong>  3. How do we want our customer to feel when they are immersed in our brand? </strong></p><p> Beyond a stunning first impression, your corporate identity design needs to take into account the customer experience of someone completely immersed in your brand. This will require you to balance your design on the fine line between consistent and boring, professional and personal, familiar and cutting edge.</p><p> Consider your entire portfolio of digital and print assets, from your logo and color palette to infographics, whitepapers, and blog posts. Does it feel overwhelming, or exciting? Welcoming, or challenging? Does it inspire confidence?</p><p> Depending on how you want your customer to feel, any of these emotions may be the one you want your corporate identity design to express.</p><p> <strong>  4. What do we want customers to do as a result of seeing our brand? </strong></p><p> Like all of your marketing assets, the ultimate goal of your corporate identity design is to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/irresistible-results-in-unsexy-industries/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   get results  </a> </u> . Clearly identify the resulting action you would like your customer to take (Create an ongoing relationship? Complete a transaction? Share with a friend?) and focus your branding on making that action seem like the right thing to do.</p><p> In practice, this might mean creating a more minimal brand design to make your customer comfortable with spending more time on your website. Or a more aggressive approach if your goal is a one-time transaction and referring your company to a colleague. Each of these decisions can be heavily influenced by your branding choices.</p><p> Startups are often defined by their speed to market and lean organization. But don&rsquo;t let those factors limit the power of your corporate identity design.</p><p> Use your branding and graphic design choices to speak volumes about your company and give your customer the experience they need to make your startup a success.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?&amp;__hssc=268771694.2.1424970788872&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1423757664345.1424970788872.10&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/smart-marketing-template_1.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "title": "If You Think Your Aging Client Is Developing Cognitive Impairment, Should You Say Anything?",
    "link": "if-you-think-your-aging-client-is-developing-cognitive-impairment-should-you-say-anything",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Imagine you&rsquo;re at your desk </strong> , calling your elderly client for approval of something you&rsquo;d like to do with his portfolio. The last time you spoke with him, he seemed a little &ldquo;out of it&rdquo; but you carried on and did your work. Now, you&rsquo;re on a call with him again and he&rsquo;s just not getting anything you&rsquo;re saying. You repeat patiently. Nothing. You suggest talking to him at a later time.</p><p> When you call back two days later, your client has no recollection of the earlier conversation that had you concerned, and worse yet, he still can seem to grasp even the simplest explanation of why you&rsquo;re calling. <br/> <br/> <strong>  What should you do? </strong></p><p> Your client has presented some ominous signs of cognitive impairment, which include inability to track the conversation and memory loss. He has no memory of your call two days earlier.  Prompting him by reminding him of when it was and what you said didn&rsquo;t help.</p><p> If you know there is a problem, there is one major reason why you absolutely must do something about it. That is: clients who are developing cognitive impairment are sitting ducks for financial abuse.  The abuse could come from a family member, which is an unfortunately common occurrence.  It could come from a credit card company who tricks your client into signing up for years of something she doesn&rsquo;t want or need. It could come from an internet scammer who preys on people exactly like your client, cleverly and with great success.  As you may have heard, the latest study on financial elder abuse found that it costs our seniors $36.48 billion a year, rather than the previous estimate of $2.9 billion.</p><p> If you believe that confidentiality prevents you from sharing anything about your client with anyone else, take you cue from the Canon of Ethics for lawyers, who have to honor confidentiality as much as anyone can.  It says, paraphrasing, that a lawyer may but is not required to <strong>   take protective action </strong>  if a client is in danger.  In my mind, any ethical lawyer who believes reasonably that her client is in danger from potential  financial abuse is going to take protective action. When you see a client too confused to follow your conversation and too impaired to remember a call two days before, that client may be in danger right now. If protective action means calling a designated emergency contact, then you should do it.  If it means taking the matter to supervisory or compliance personnel in your organization, then do that as well. If you believe you have no other choice but to get rid of your client and no longer handle his finances or business affairs, then that is also a choice.  However, we at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com   </a> </u> think you do have options other than firing your impaired client.</p><p> When we look at the law, it builds in protections for those who lose the ability to manage finances for themselves. One of these is a Durable Power of Attorney.  Every prudent person who gets estate planning done should have a DPOA as part of the estate planning package.  Take your cue from what the law allows any adult to do. That is, everyone should appoint a trusted person to take over when he or she is no longer able to manage finances independently.  You client should appoint someone you can call and most importantly give you permission to call or contact that appointed person when your client demonstrates behavior as we described above.  The person your client has designated on the DPOA to be her agent may also be the one she give you permission to contact if you believe she is vulnerable to abuse.</p><p> Every advisor, business professional and lawyer serving older clients should have permission to contact a third party in the event of emergency or imminent danger.  You can get it done with a straightforward document.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t sure how to get a waiver of privacy done or whom your client wants to designate, it&rsquo;s time to act now. Get these things accomplished with the help of experts who can guide you. If you have them in your organization or at your disposal, create your policy without any delay.

    "content": "<p>  </p><p> Search Engine Optimization is a constantly evolving field and  <u>  2015 is seeing lots of changes </u> . Google, Yahoo and Bing regularly improve their algorithm to provide the best search results. However, lots of Financial Advisors I meet have that unique simple question in mind &ldquo;How can we be first on Google?&rdquo;, to which I reply by <strong>  &ldquo;What do you prefer? Be first on Google or get new clients\"? </strong>  SEO has evolved a lot, le&rsquo;ts catch up!</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I focused a lot on these few singular keyword\" </strong></p><p> Keywords are quite important because they help your content to be ranked on Google based on a certain query. However, people&rsquo;s usage of the search engines have changed a lot for the last 10 years and with the increasing number of websites, refining a research has become a priority. Therefore, users are increasingly using long keywords or even sentences to find better results. Also known as &ldquo;long tail,\" these give you great information on what matters for your potential leads as well as opportunities to serve these needs.  When picking your keywords, don&rsquo;t focus too much on single keywords (ex: &ldquo;Financial Advisor Quebec&rdquo;) but rather on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   long-tail  </a> </u>  (ex: &ldquo;Financial Advisor specialized retirement plan Quebec&rdquo;).</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I create lots of texts so Google will rank me well!&rdquo; </strong></p><p> It is indeed quite important to create a fair amount of content and to keep it updated, so to make sure Google understands what your business is about and if it is still alive. However, web content serve the same purpose than printed content: inform about your offerings, introduce and strengthen your brand, display professionalism and more. At the end of the day, what counts is what your visitors and leads think about you, not Google. Therefore, don&rsquo;t overdo it with keywords and create content you know your leads are interested in! (ex: &ldquo;how can I optimize my taxes?&rdquo;, &ldquo;how can I save more on banking fees?&rdquo; or &ldquo;how much of my assets should I invest in gold?&rdquo;).</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard backlinks are important, so I bought 5,000 of them!&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Backlinks are like reference letters. If you got a reference letter from a major player in your industry, that&rsquo;s great and will probably have a great impact for you. If the one you got is crappy. well, it&rsquo;s not soo good. <br/> <br/> Now, let&rsquo;s change perspective. If you have 10 backlinks from leading websites in your industry, it will bring you qualified potential leads, strengthen your brand image, improve your ranking and domain authority (since it&rsquo;s a bit too long to explain now, I recommend this  <u>  <a href=\"http://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   simple video from MOZ  </a> </u> ). If you &ldquo;buy&rdquo; 1000 backlinks, these will probably be on either low ranked domain or blacklisted websites (which will have a terrible impact for your own ranking and domain), with no relation whatsoever with your industry (keep in mind search engines can actually understand the context in which your content is connected to) and will not bring you any potential lead. <br/> <br/> Now, what do you prefer? Get 10,000 links for 5 USD and risking being blacklisted or get 20 backlinks from highly respected (Asset Managers, Wealth Managers, Tax Lawyers, Financial Advisors) and getting new potential clients?</p><p> Search Engine Optimization is of a major importance not only for your own business ranking, but for your credibility as a professional as well as your brand.

Here&rsquo;s a sampling of the complaints about lenders: <br/> &bull; No flexibility. <br/> &bull; Refinancing may one day be possible &ndash; but not now. <br/> &bull; &ldquo;Bureaucratic nightmare.&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, private lenders are not under the same obligations as the federal government to show flexibility in renegotiating federally funded loans; for example, the government forgives loans for some public workers or offers  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven\" target=\"_blank\">   payment plans  </a> </u>  that take into account graduates&rsquo; incomes for those who don&rsquo;t earn enough to meet their loan payments.</p><p> So before taking out student loans, consult the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/paying-for-college/choose-a-student-loan/#o1\" target=\"_blank\">   CFPB consumer guide  </a> </u> , which recommends exhausting all federal loans before resorting to private loans.</p><p> The issues raised in the complaints detailed below sound similar to subprime borrowers&rsquo; experiences with loan servicing firms.</p><p> &ldquo;Only deferment is offered, which does nothing for the actual amount owed &ndash; just allows more interest to accrue,&rdquo; said one borrower.</p><p> A 50-year-old said his lender offers loan forbearance in two-month spurts, charging him a $50 fee each time. The servicer also suggested the borrower settle his loans by agreeing on a total payoff amount and then persuading his mother to take out a line of credit to pay them off, he said.</p><p> &ldquo;They will not help me with lowering or changing payments because they are private,&rdquo; one teacher said about her lender. &ldquo;I am stuck forever.&rdquo; [Student loans largely cannot be discharged in bankruptcy court.]</p><p> Another borrower who described his servicer as &ldquo;horrible&rdquo; said the firm is unwilling to negotiate any terms. &ldquo;The stress is about to kill me.&rdquo;</p><p> Nineteen borrowers describing themselves as &ldquo;part of the most indebted graduating class ever&rdquo; signed a letter saying that they have experienced &ldquo;confusion, inefficient communication, lost paper work and  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/field-work/frustrations-of-managing-college-loans/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &lsquo;runarounds&rsquo;  </a> </u> &rdquo; as well as a &ldquo;lack of consistency&rdquo; in how servicing firms and lenders address borrowers&rsquo; requests.</p><p> &ldquo;They were not flexible at all and said I would have to wait a few more years, reamortize (not sure that is the right word), which would likely only lower my payment by $30-$40 per month,&rdquo; said one borrower seeking repayment options.</p><p> An elderly man in Columbus, Ohio, on a &ldquo;tight budget&rdquo; said he didn&rsquo;t receive a statement when his payment was due for student loans for his son&rsquo;s education. His wife, who also has loans for graduate school, gets &ldquo;sporadic&rdquo; statements, which often come just days before they&rsquo;re due.</p><p> A couple in their late 60s have been paying loans on their son&rsquo;s college education for 25 years and owe $17,000. They said they have been unable to get information from their lenders about loan forgiveness programs. [Debt forgiveness after  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.finaid.org/loans/ibr.phtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   25 years  </a> </u>  is available for certain federal loans.]</p><p> One cash-strapped borrower pays his loan on Friday and is charged interest over the weekend, because the payment isn&rsquo;t posted until the following week. The additional interest reduces his principal payment, he said. &ldquo;How is anyone supposed to get ahead of their loans when this happens?&rdquo;</p><p> A recent graduate said her servicer was &ldquo;easy to talk to,&rdquo; but she won&rsquo;t be able to pay her loans if she doesn&rsquo;t get a full-time job.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I'm not a licensed pilot, but I sure get a kick out of aviation. Flight, especially the powered kind, just seems to drop metaphors from the sky - perfect for illustrating narratives.  Consider this:  there are two major types of flying machine - fixed wing (airplanes) and rotary wing (helicopters).  Both use an engine to force their flight surfaces through the air, creating lift.  An airplane uses a jet engine or piston engine to propel its wings forward, and a helicopter uses its power plant to rotate its wings for exactly the same effect.  Same resultant lift, but vastly different methods.</p><p> Airplanes can be beautiful, and sleek lines are both pleasing to the eye and functional:  less drag means more lift.  Helicopters, though, don't have to worry as much about sleek lines and aerodynamic shapes.  After all, as the old saying goes, helos don't actually fly, they just beat the air into submission.  That's not true, of course, but they do fly differently.  Cut the power to an airplane and a helicopter flying side by side at 3,000 feet and which one do you predict will glide farther?</p><p> <strong>  Some Family Businesses are Airplanes, some are Helicopters </strong></p><p> And the same can be said about Family Business Owners.  It's not empirically robust (yet), but I would argue that the controlling owner's gender -and his/her spouse's role - will play a significant part in a transition.  In their groundbreaking book \"The $14 Trillion Woman,\" Barbara Kay and Anthony DiLeonardi explore the differences between male and female investors - how they set goals and reach critical decisions.  To paraphrase them, men tend to be more goal oriented and women set their sights more on security and freedom.  Similarly, male and female stakeholders view things the same way.  In some multi-generation family business transition scenarios, a patriarch is more likely to focus on enterprise value and multiples to reach a clear monetary threshold, enough to buy that lake house, red Ferrari, or other tangible goal.  The matriarch, of course, wants enough to enable them to live their dreams, but not if it tears the family apart in the process.</p><p> <strong>  Family Business Transitions Succeed or Fail Because of Communication </strong></p><p> Remember:  FOB|BOF - the family owned business and business owning family are opposite sides of the same coin; they are inextricably linked and affect each other immensely.  The solid vertical line between them represents a coin, a mirror, and/or a barrier - of language.  Business models and strategies have always been written in the language of the FOB, but if a transition is to succeed they MUST be written in a language understandable by both the FOB and the BOF.  Don't misunderstand me:  I don't just mean rephrasing them with different words.  I mean business models and strategy plans envisioned, created and implemented by the entire BOF for its own goals and objectives, using the FOB as a critical resource to achieve them.</p><p> <strong>  A transition shouldn't be the final chapter in the story of the Family Owned Business, it should be the next chapter in the story of the Family. </strong></p>",

You are someone who is able to take risks and stretch assignments because you believe you can do it.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re in the second category, the prevention focused group, you will play it safe, look to follow the rules and regulations, and keep your head down.</p><p> <strong>  Which of these makes a better leader? </strong></p><p> The answer would probably be the first category, but the reality is you need a mixture of both to be a great leader.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not enough to have a large vision, influence lots of people, build trust and motivate your followers. You must also know how to handle the details, be deliberate in your actions, and be prepared for the worst, even as you keep a positive spin on the direction you&rsquo;re taking, and get buy-in from those who are supporting you.</p><p> <strong>  Leadership is complicated. </strong></p><p> When different personalities work together there is always stress. I hear it all the time in my coaching practice when my clients complain about their co-workers, or their bosses. The problem gets exacerbated when there is a my-way or the highway approach that causes great stress among the team.</p><p> In research done with more than 12,500 private, public, military, and government organizations across 21 countries by Professors Andrew and Nada K. Kakabadse found the following correlated with Promotion versus Prevention leadership styles.</p><p> If you have a promotion boss and a prevention employee, you may find that the employee feels overlooked and underutilized because they the boss fails to encourage him with defined tasks and clear objectives. Thus, you get underperformance.</p><p> With promotion employee and prevention employee working together their contrasting styles will lead to tension. The person who is more cautious will find the person who has more drive threatening. In turn, the other will be frustrated by the barriers and may openly challenge him.</p><p> Promotion boss and prevention boss there is a power struggle. One will emphasize successes, which undermines the other, and criticism ensues, frequently behind the person&rsquo;s back.</p><p> <strong>  Prevention boss and promotion employee are a ticket to micromanagement </strong> ,which doesn&rsquo;t sit well with promotion person who sees it as overly critical and builds resentment, which ultimately lead to leaving.</p><p> To avoid these scenarios, knowing your strengths and weaknesses, as well as understanding where you put your focus, will go a long way toward developing understanding. Sometimes minor tweaks in how to connect with others can make a huge difference.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://janiceburney.com/author/JaniceBurney/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Janice Burney  </a> </u></p><p> Has your bank decided to join the technology and innovation ranks to embrace the fintech revolution?</p><p> As should be expected, European Banks are ahead of this embrace-the-technology curve. From incubators to launching a fintech subsidiary, it&rsquo;s clear an innovative bank will be the survivor in this emerging marketplace that is disrupting the banking status quo.</p><p> <strong>  But is innovative banking an oxymoron? </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s see.</p><p> Here are some interesting stats. An analysis by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.atkearney.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A.T. Kearney  </a> </u>  shows that stock returns for banks that bought technology companies far exceeded returns for banks acquiring other &lsquo;like&rsquo; peers.</p><p> <strong>  1. What have banks done in the face of fintech&rsquo;s emerging disruption? Here are highlights on how banks reacted to trends in fintech: </strong></p><li> 10% Acquired fintech companies</li><li> 20% Setup venture funds to fund fintech companies</li><li> 43% Established fintech Incubation programs</li><li> 20% Partnered with fintech programs</li><li> 7% Launched fintech subsidiaries <br/>  </li><p> The preferred strategy for most banks is to create startup programs that incubate fintech companies.</p><p> European banks dominate fintech related engagement with over 80% of the banks analyzed headquartered in Europe.</p><p> <strong>  2. Technology purchases are a core shareholder value and the &lsquo;right&rsquo; purchases could foster positive results to the bottom line. However, determining the &lsquo;right&rsquo; technology purchase played an important part in realizing this increased value. </strong></p><p> Evaluating the M&amp;A data consisted of looking at the data from a bank purchasing another bank versus a bank making a technology play. It became clear that the technology play drove better returns. Isolating the &lsquo;reward&rsquo; component of the M&amp;A decision for the thirty largest retail global banks (based on assets) revealed the following:</p><p> Bank-to-bank acquisitions achieved returns of 4%-6% after 12 months, while bank-to-tech acquisitions returned 10%-15% over the same period.</p><p> A technology savvy bank signals the marketplace that they are willing to adopt a more digitally rich future by leaning into technology purchases.</p><p> The key is in understanding the value of the technology purchase and it&rsquo;s future growth potential. Not all technologies are equal!</p><p> <a href=\"http://thefinancialbrand.com/44750/banking-technology-merger-acquisition-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A.T Kearney </a>  divided technology acquisition into three categories, with the results of Heavy Lifters demonstrating the highest average share price return in comparison to the Innovators and General Tech, as follows:</p><li> Stock gain of +20% &ndash; Heavy Lifters, unique capabilities that disrupt bank&rsquo;s back offices.</li><li> Stock gain of 15%-20% &ndash; Innovators, focused on social media, web and mobile.</li><li> Stock gain of 5% &ndash; 10% &ndash; General Tech, &lsquo;catch-all&rsquo; category for traditional software/ hardware acquisitions. <br/>  </li><p> The Heavy Lifter numbers returned the highest value over time may not be surprising since banks benefit from cost reductions and hopefully will understand the value of passing this onto the consumer in the form of more attractive loans, better programs and improved customer service. We could hope!</p><p> Remember ING Bank &ndash; the European online powerhouse that brought banking and hang-out coffee shops to the USA? They were an innovative forerunner in the technology and customer service banking-space and crossed many horizons in the online banking vertical before being acquired by Capital One. Now much of the ING-way has been lost to a dubious Capital One horizon.</p><p> One key for a gobbling-technology bank is to remember that technology functions as an integral part of an organization. It&rsquo;s not wise to strip out the core digital customer care components that make the technology so unique, just to drive shareholder value.</p><p> While new generations of digital users want their banks to foster the innovative technology footprint, it should not be at the expense of the very tenants that are valued like ease of doing business, accessibility and responsiveness.</p>",

Here's an overview of the types of questions you should have in your sales skills toolbox.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Open-Ended Questions  </strong> <br/> <br/> Open-ended questions are made to encourage full, meaningful answers from the subject's point of view. They often begin with the words \"Who,\" \"What,\" \"How,\" or \"Tell me about.\" Open-ended questions can be used to gain information from a customer before you offer solutions and value propositions. As a listener, it's important that you listen not only to the words in the customer's answer, but the meaning behind them. Be aware that questions beginning with \"Why\" have the potential for putting the other person on the defensive, and may not be effective at eliciting important information.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Tie-Down Questions </strong>   <br/> <br/> Tie-down questions can help establish you and your customer as partners, and they encourage the customer to move along in the conversation with you. Tie-down questions are those small questions at the beginning or end of a statement, such as, \"Keeping up with all this new technology can be a challenge, can't it?\" They tend to elicit agreement, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/harvey-mackay/2-words-close-deals-faster.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   get the customer used to saying, \"Yes.\"  </a> </u>   <br/> <br/> You don't, however, want to use more than a couple of tie-down questions in a row, because then they sound more like a script or a technique than genuine attempts to gain information. They're best used when reinforcing benefits, and should be used before you share your value proposition with your customer.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Choice Questions  </strong> <br/> <br/> Choice questions are just what they say: questions that give customers options from which to choose. They can be valuable when customers aren't sure what they need, or when they need a gentle prompt to make a decision. With choice questions, it's best if you limit the choices to two or three - any more can be overwhelming or confusing. For example, \"Do you prefer to take delivery by the first of the month, or the fifteenth?\" offers the customer a reasonable number of choices, both of which are positive, and demonstrates that you care about their needs.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Value Questions  </strong> <br/> <br/> Value questions are important in your sales skills repertoire, because they help the buyer quantify benefits. This sets you up to offer a solution that creates your unique value proposition. Value questions should be posed after the buyer has identified a problem (\"It takes too long to do inventory.\") With value questions, you can help the customer understand the value attached to the solution you offer, but it's important that before asking, you have an idea what you can do in terms of quantifiable results. An example value question might be, \"What would it be worth to your profitability if you could reduce the time it takes to conduct inventory audits by 20%?\"  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Reverse Questions  </strong> <br/> <br/> Reverse questions refers to answering a question with another relevant question, and they're perfect when closing a sale. Knowing when to use reverse questions should be one of your practiced sales skills. Typically, they work well in answer to general questions, and open up possibilities that can close the sale on a positive note. Suppose your customer has committed to buying your product and asks, \"Can I get it in blue?\" Your reverse question can increase his satisfaction further. You could say, \"What shade of blue do you like?\" A good reverse question can be the perfect punctuation to closing the sale and gaining commitment.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Conclusion  </strong> <br/> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/course/consultative-selling\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ability to ask the right questions  </a> </u>  in the right context is one of the strongest sales skills you can have. Asking questions not only lets you uncover the information you need to create a solution and value proposition for your customer, but also establishes rapport and builds relationships. There are many types of questions, and knowing when to use which one is like being a master carpenter who always knows the right tool for the job.  <br/> <br/> With  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CSC  </a> </u> 's consultative sales certifications, you will learn among other things how to use questions to establish and deepen customer relationships, and which questions are well-suited to which situations.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just automate Social Media, we can then go back to doing our day jobs&rdquo; </strong></p><p> This is a direct quote from one of my &ldquo;social media savvy&rdquo; colleagues in Dublin the other week.</p><p> I was then dragged into a conversation of the relative merits of @Buffer vs @hootsuite. Which one was the best the best at scheduling Tweets.</p><p> <strong>  To Schedule or not to Schedule </strong></p><p> Tweets have a short &ldquo;self life&rdquo;, research shows that they tend to have an active duration of about 18 minutes.  This is crazy from a Marketing prospective were you are looking for your message to have penetration, reach and longevity.</p><p> You could Tweet every 18 minutes, but you would come across as a spammer and need a full time Tweeter.</p><p> <strong>  The Argument for </strong></p><p> Automating repetitive tasks is a good idea. For example, if you are running a conference you can automate Tweets; coming up sessions, quotes from speakers.  This would actually free you up to be more reactive (customer focused) on the day.</p><p> It can also help getting content to an audience that might other wise not see it.  55% of my followers are in the US and active when I&rsquo;m asleep.  I therefore schedule Tweets during that time to make sure I can reach followers mainly on West Coast time.  Myself, like many brands like to have an &ldquo;always on&rdquo; approach to meet our global audience.</p><p> I found @Buffer made a significant impact to me.  My day job is with a large American software house and the demands of this role mean I don&rsquo;t have time to Tweet during the day.  Buffer enables me to schedule a number of Tweets so I can tweet while in meetings.</p><p> <strong>  The Argument Against </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m writing this sitting in my favourite Deli in West London; Zoran&rsquo;s.  Zoran knows all his customers, he knows I like table 5 and I drink Americano. This level of personalization is not new, in fact I would call it old fashioned.</p><p> The web has provided us with many benefits, it changed our life&rsquo;s (for the better).  But the web has distanced us from our customers.</p><p> <strong>  Social Media was sent to save us. </strong> Social Media enables us without being creepy (well you can be creepy if you want but don&rsquo;t recommend it), to get closer to our customers.  To get back the level of personalisation we lost when we implemented the web.  We can now have a conversation with our customers, find out what their wants and needs are.  In fact we can engage with our customers, I would go so far to say that customers who love our brand want engagement.</p><p> For example, many consumer goods companies are combining the web and Social Media to support new product introductions (NPIs).  They are doing this via Crowd-Sourcing or via brand advocate programs.</p><p> Just think all that collective knowledge and intellect out there ready for you to tap into.  No more brain storming sessions on how to innovate your products. Dive right in.</p><p> <strong>  Immediacy vs Spam </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m a big believer in using Buffer but you still have to have the the personal touch. I love the way my followers interact on Twitter, some great opinions, these people are bloody clever.  So while I may use Buffer I always build in time in the day to respond.  In my opinion, without that common touch and immediacy, the Twitter feed can become spam.  In my opinion Social Media automation should extend no further than scheduling posts.</p><p> I&rsquo;m aware of somebody that when I retweet them, they send me an automatic Tweet &ldquo;thank you for the retweet&rdquo;.  I stopped reweeting them until I had a conversation with them and it was switched off.</p><p> Social Media is all about people-to-brand and brand-to-people engagement.  <strong>  Why would you want to dehumanize this engagement? </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ll leave you with two questions:-</p><p> <strong>  Are scheduled Tweets with no immediacy just spam? </strong></p><p> <strong>  If people and corporations just schedule Tweets and LinkedIn updates will this, in time, kill Social Media? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p>  </p><p> I want to share what I believe is some really great news for your business. No matter how big your firm or your ambitions are, you can succeed spectacularly &ndash; or if you&rsquo;re already doing well &ndash; more spectacularly. Want to know why? Because the business and competitive landscape has been disrupted and it will never be the way it used to be again.</p><p> Today, business success is determined less by the products or services you sell (someone else almost certainly sells them too). It&rsquo;s not the biggest ad budget or the most clever creative either. Today, business success is driven by great ideas and the relationships and experiences that companies create for their employees and their customers.</p><p> While leadership treated their employees as though they were friends, they did nothing to challenge or advance their best people, they provided no career path or opportunities for self-improvement, and they ignored their employees&rsquo; customer insights &ndash; even though they were the ones who were face-to-face with those customers day in and day out.</p><p> Employees were expected to work on outdated equipment in a physical environment with no consideration for the employees&rsquo; health or well-being. You get the picture. The leaders were &ldquo;nice guys&rdquo;, no doubt about it, and their employees were generally satisfied. But from a marketing perspective, this was not a Good Guy company.</p><p> Running a Good Guy business is about systems: The policies and procedures that encourage and promote interaction, collaboration and reciprocity. Good Guy companies operate organizations that communicate constantly, not because it&rsquo;s in someone&rsquo;s nature to be communicative, but because the behavior has been institutionalized, acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start by taking a look at the crucial work of engaging your employees.</p><p> By now, you&rsquo;re probably aware that an engaged workforce gives companies a remarkable competitive advantage. Organizations like the  <u>  Great Place to Work Institute </u>  exist to educate companies about the advantages of an engaged workforce and the statistics are compelling to say the least.</p><li> Increasing employee engagement investments by 10% can increase profits by $2,400 per employee, per year. (Source:  <u>  Workplace Research Foundation </u> )</li><li> According to Bersin and Associates, the current annual employee engagement spend in the US is $720 million. Bersin expects this spend to increase drastically to about $1.5 billion.</li><li> Highly engaged employees are 38% more likely to have above-average productivity. (Source: Workplace Research Foundation), one of the most powerful contributors to improved profitability.</li><li> Companies that foster engaged brand ambassadors in their workforce report an average of 2.69 sick days taken annually per employee, compared to companies with weak engagement efforts, reporting an average of 6.19 sick days. (Source: Workplace Research Foundation)</li><li> Companies with engaged employees, outperform those without by 202%. (Source:  <u>  Dale Carnegie </u> )</li><li> Companies who implement regular employee feedback have turnover rates that are 14.9% lower than for employees who receive no feedback. (Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.surveyanalytics.com/2014/02/top-5-infographics-of-week-employee.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a> </u> )</li><li> Only about 25% of business leaders have an employee engagement strategy. (Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://dailyinfographic.com/10-shocking-statistics-about-employee-engagement-infographic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dale Carnegie  </a> </u> ) </li><li> Higher service, quality, and productivity</li><li> Higher customer satisfaction</li><li> Increased sales (repeat business and referrals)</li><li> Higher levels of profit</li><li> Higher shareholder returns or earnings <br/>  </li><p> Now you may be wondering why I, a marketer, seem to be so obsessed with a workplace concern that would fall under Human Resources in a larger company or management in smaller businesses.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;in today&rsquo;s marketplace, operations and marketing are inseparably and irretrievably connected. What you do is every bit as important as what you say.</p><p> Thanks largely to digital media, Marketing in the 21st century has been democratized. Today, user reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor.com, Angie&rsquo;s List, Yahoo, eBay and Amazon are more influential than any amount of advertising &ndash; no matter how good the advertising is.</p><p> Of course, advertising, PR and other traditional marketing tools have their place. Billions each year is still spent on these channels to stimulate interest and generate awareness.</p><p> But today, these tools must be considered within the whole of the clients&rsquo; experience</p><li> Which is directly impacted by the employees&rsquo; experience,</li><li> Which is directly impacted by companies&rsquo; leadership,</li><li> Who are challenged to establish systems that</li><li> Serve the greater goal of creating a real connection with the people your company employs, and the people your company serves. <br/>  </li><p> This helps explain why growth in digital marketing has, and will continue to, outpace traditional marketing. Digital marketing is all about generosity. This is what I think is such great news for your company, especially if it is or can be a Good Guy company. Generosity is built into Good Guy companies. They understand that before they ask for the business, they need to earn trust. Your company, no matter how big or small, can do this. I look forward to hearing great things about how your Good Guy company has seized the opportunity.</p><p>  </p>",

For Hispanics, that figure is 350 percent.</p><p> What does that mean in dollars and cents? A  <u>  <a href=\"http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/multicultural-economy-report-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   University of Georgia Multicultural Economy report  </a> </u>  says the purchasing power of Hispanics in the United States in 2014 was $1.3 trillion. For African Americans that number was only slightly smaller at $1.1 trillion, and for Asians it was $770 billion.</p><p> <strong>  Too many companies see minority groups as outside of their potential market </strong> , cutting off literally billions of dollars in potential revenue. A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/barneys-racial-profiling-settlement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   perfect example  </a> </u>  is the disappointing string of accusations &ndash; resulting in a $525,000 settlement &ndash; against luxury retailer Barneys, which claimed that the department store was racially profiling African Americans by neglecting to serve customers of color and putting extra efforts into surveillance of black shoppers. Not only does such behavior turn money away at the actual store where it&rsquo;s taking place, but the national headlines and related word-of-mouth generated by such behavior also alienates an enormously wealthy potential customer base.</p><p> The issue is not exclusive to the United States.

The study found that, not only were Canadian ads under-representing people of color, but those minority groups portrayed were also &ldquo;represented much more narrowly, and stereotypically.&rdquo;</p><p> The underlying unconscious bias at work in these examples is that the lion&rsquo;s share of the wealth among potential consumers is held in the hands of white people. This subconscious bias is leaving trillions of dollars on the table.</p><p> <strong>  The bottom line lesson? Be inclusive! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> You know the importance of investing for  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/401k-vs-roth-ira-which-is-right-for-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your retirement  </a> </u>  and growing your wealth so you can achieve your biggest financial goals. <strong>  But how much should you contribute to make sure you have enough in your nest egg when you need it? </strong></p><p> The exact number is difficult to pinpoint &ndash; but there are some ways to plan based on your goals, and a few general rules of thumb you can use to ballpark how much you need to invest.</p><p> <strong>  Why Investing (Now!) Matters </strong></p><p> Remember the power of  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/cost-of-waiting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   compound interest  </a> </u> . Compounding means that by starting as soon as possible and giving your money time to grow, you&rsquo;re giving yourself a better financial position than someone who delayed their efforts to save and invest.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t put off investing because you think you can&rsquo;t contribute enough to your accounts. Every little bit truly helps &ndash; but what does that mean in terms of the exact amount you should invest each month?</p><p> <strong>  Think About Your Unique Goals and Needs </strong></p><p> Ultimately, there&rsquo;s not a one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how much you should save. How much you should save depends on your goals, what you&rsquo;d like to  <u>  accomplish in life </u> , and how you want your future to look.</p><p> Start by asking yourself what type of short-term investments interest you. Think things like  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/saving-down-payment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   buying a home  </a> </u>  or traveling abroad. Then consider how much those things will cost. Once you have an estimate, you can break that big number down into how much you need to save and invest each month to reach these short-term goals.</p><p> After you&rsquo;ve thought about things in the short-term, consider your long-term investments and goals like retirement and financial independence. If you want to live a certain lifestyle in retirement, consider how much that lifestyle will cost you per year.</p><p> If you want to spend most of your time traveling, a year in retirement will cost you more than if you wanted to spend most of your time enjoying your home, having family and friends over, and going for walks around the neighborhood or volunteering for your favorite cause. Neither one of these situations is &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the other, but financially speaking they look really different.</p><p> Envision your ideal lifestyle after work (and when you&rsquo;ll need to start drawing from your investments). Then take some educated guesses on your costs and expenses and create a mock yearly budget for yourself.</p><p> Multiplying that budget over a period of years (like 25, 30, or 40) will give you an idea of the total amount you&rsquo;ll need in your nest egg before you can retire &ndash; and you can work backward from there to determine how much you need to invest each month  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-handle-your-year-end-bonus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   during your working career  </a> </u>  to meet that goal.</p><p> <strong>  Rules of Thumb to Help You Determine How Much You Should Invest </strong></p><p> While there&rsquo;s no one right answer, trying to figure things out in your unique situation down to the last cent can be scary, overwhelming, and way too complicated.</p><p> Instead, give yourself a starting point by using these common rules of thumb. These aren&rsquo;t perfect measures of how much you&rsquo;ll need to invest and how much you&rsquo;ll need in retirement, but they can help get you in a realistic ballpark.</p><p> <strong>  8 Times Your Ending Salary: </strong> A good rule of thumb is multiplying your ending salary by 8. Let&rsquo;s say you end your full-time working career making $90,000 a year. In this rule of thumb, you should have around $720,000 saved for retirement.</p><p> Some factors can influence this amount, including how long you expect to live or how much you plan to spend in retirement. If you&rsquo;d like to live a more lavish lifestyle in retirement than you did while working, you&rsquo;ll want to save more.</p><p> <strong>  The Multiply-By-25 Rule: </strong> This one&rsquo;s extremely simple. Take your anticipated annual expenses and multiply that number by 25. Many people take their ending salary to use as a guide. For example, say your ending salary is $100,000. Your nest egg should be $2.5 million before retirement.</p><p> <strong>  The 4% Rule: </strong> The 4% Rule helps show you how much you can withdraw annually in retirement. Let&rsquo;s say you retire with $800,000 in your portfolio. The 4% rule says that, in order to stay solvent throughout your retirement years, you should withdraw no more than 4% of that $800,000 &ndash; or $32,000 a year. Every year thereafter, you will continue to withdraw $32,000 adjusted for inflation.</p><p> <strong>  Invest in Percentages: </strong> Because many of these numbers in investments and retirement revolve around the income you make, it makes sense to look at percentages of that income and decide how much you should invest from that. In other words, don&rsquo;t get caught up on hard numbers.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re in your twenties, aim to save 10% to 20% of your income &ndash; whatever that number happens to be. Every time you receive a raise, increase that percentage. When you&rsquo;re in your thirties, make it your goal to invest 20% to 30% of your income. Work to increase that number as you earn more money (or as you reduce your expenses).</p>",

Avinash kindly agreed, so read on ....An analysis of the strategies being adopted by banks across the world to address FinTech.<p> <strong>  The financial technology space has always been a happening area as banks and financial firms have always been early adopters of technology. </strong> This continues today with a new generation of Financial Technology (FinTech) companies who are leveraging the Internet, mobile and social technologies, cloud computing and Big Data to build and take to market innovative solutions that are changing the way financial services are accessed, delivered and experienced.</p><p> Some of these FinTech companies sell their solutions to banks while many others are bypassing their traditional banking client base and are offering their solutions directly to financial services customers over the Internet with innovative and cost effective value based offerings. They include companies that offer credit/lending services (including peer to peer, crowd sourced and other varieties), payments services (and as a result small amount deposits for payments) and financial management services targeting retail and small business customers.</p><p> <strong>  With FinTech becoming such a hot area, here is an analysis that potentially highlights trends on how major banks across the globe are reacting to the FinTech phenomenon. </strong> The analysis is based on publicly available news articles and press releases from banks and FinTech companies in 2013 and 2014.</p><p> <strong>  Here are some of the key findings: </strong></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6a01053620481c970b01b8d0de0ed6970c-700wi.png\" width=\"700\"/><li> The preferred strategy for most banks is to create startup programs to incubate FinTech companies with just under half of them doing so or to set up venture funds to fund FinTech companies with 20% of them choosing this strategy.</li><li> Alternatively, one fifth of the banks analyzed have adopted to partner with FinTech companies directly while a few banks have adopted different strategies by acquiring FinTech companies or launching their own FinTech subsidiaries.</li><li> Approximately 60% of the FinTech companies that the banks engaged with as part of any of the mentioned strategies are enterprise FinTech companies that offer technology solutions to banks while 40% of the FinTech companies they engaged with offer financial services on their platforms directly to the retail and small business market.</li><li> European banks dominate FinTech related engagement with over 80% of the banks analyzed headquartered in Europe. North American banks account for only 20% of the banks. Based on the little information available, banks in Asia Pacific seem to be adopting a more conservative strategy and are working with a few leading traditional IT firms who have their own FinTech innovation programs. Additionally, almost all of the banks in the list are large Tier one banks with deep enough pockets.</li><li> It must be noted that banks are also increasingly engaging with FinTech via other channels like Industry Associations/Bodies &mdash; SWIFT&rsquo;s Innotribe is an example.</li> <p> Key Sources:1.  <u>  <a href=\"http://thefinancialbrand.com/44750/banking-technology-merger-acquisition-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://thefinancialbrand.com/44750/banking-technology-merger-acquisition-study/  </a> </u></p><p> 2.  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/04/banks-lure-fintech-startups-with-venture-funds/\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Banks Lure Fintech Startups With Venture Funds  </u>  <u>   Surrounded on all sides by a bewildering array of new financial technology companies springing up, the big banks have&hellip;blogs.wsj.com  </u> </a></p><p> 3.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fiercefinanceit.com/story/bank-backed-fintech-accelerators-swell-number/2014-08-21\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.fiercefinanceit.com/story/bank-backed-fintech-accelerators-swell-number/2014-08-21  </a> </u></p><p> 4.  <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/banking-trading-and-technology/fintech-2014-wrap-up-6218df7f2a7f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   https://medium.com/banking-trading-and-technology/fintech-2014-wrap-up-6218df7f2a7f  </a> </u></p>​",

    "content": "<strong> To get your content in front of the right people at the right time, here&rsquo;s a different take on the elements of a successful content marketing strategy. </strong><strong> 1) Au &ndash; Gold</strong>Widely used for monetary exchange throughout history and synonymous with wealth, gold is an element of inherent value.View your audience as equally valuable, they&rsquo;re the ones who will dig into their pockets and give you their gold. Make it a priority to understand their perceptions, their opinions and their habits. Research trumps suppositions here; make sure you&rsquo;re sure.In this list of <u> <a href=\"http://smallbiztrends.com/2014/04/missing-elements-content-strategy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  7 missing elements of your content strategy </a></u>, not understanding your audience comes in as number five. The author recommends you create content personas to help target your content and speak to them specifically.In Brazen Profit Lab&rsquo;s article <u> <a href=\"http://www.brazenprofitlab.com/ecommerce-marketing-2/a-successful-content-marketing-strategy-for-ecommerce-business-owners/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The 6 Elements to a Successful Content Marketing Strategy for eCommerce Business Owners in 2014 </a></u>, she recommends getting to &ldquo;know your audience as well as you know yourself.&rdquo; How? By doing interviews, polls, podcasts, and giving away products for review.No matter how you do it, the idea is to tailor your content to your audience. Know how they consume it, where they read it and what the context will be.Someone who&rsquo;s scanning your blog on a mobile while riding the subway home from work will want something different than someone who&rsquo;s watching your videos on their tablet over coffee at breakfast. Most importantly, know what they think about your brand so you can address and mold those opinions.<strong> 2) Fe &ndash; Iron</strong>Used in metallurgy since the 4 millennium BC, Iron was molded into tools by our ancestors, and eventually, protected 19th century warships known as Ironclads.You need an ironclad awareness and knowledge of your topic. You&rsquo;re producing content that demonstrates your particular expertise. Whether its software, small-engine repair or sales training, your content serves as a proof point for your business. The key is translating that knowledge and experience into content.Plan your content around particular pieces of knowledge or experiences; this will position you as an expert and give your audience something of value.<strong> 3) N &ndash; Nitrogen</strong>It&rsquo;s the most abundant element in our atmosphere, making up almost 80% of the air around us. Still, it goes mostly unnoticed. It&rsquo;s invisible and largely taken for granted.Without a strong message, your content will go equally unnoticed. In Neil Patel&rsquo;s article, <a href=\"/category/sell/content-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Your content marketing campaign will fail without these 10 features</a>, he highlights the importance of knowing your message. He advocates a three-step process for developing a message that starts with a mission statement and uses that to derive core and secondary messages.Your mission statement can be a good foundation for your message, you just need to identify it and make sure it&rsquo;s a central part of your content strategy.<strong> 4. C &ndash; Carbon</strong>Carbon exists as both graphite and as diamonds. Consider the difference in value.Here&rsquo;s where a good designer and a good writer earn their keep. We&rsquo;ve all got budgets to consider, but including professionals on your content team who will deliver the best is the difference between graphite and diamonds.Writers (and other creative) are included in this article on the <u> <a href=\"http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2329123/4-Critical-Elements-of-a-Successful-Content-Marketing-Team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  4 Critical Elements of a Successful Content Marketing Team </a></u>; you&rsquo;d be wise to heed this advice. It&rsquo;s the difference between appearing professional or amateurish, between making a point or sounding preachy, between selling your product or creating content no one reads. Their job is to make you look good, make sure you let them.<strong> 5) Cs &ndash; Cesium</strong>The Caesium standard defines the second; Atomic clocks use this element to accurately mark the passage of time.You&rsquo;ll need to invest time into your content marketing strategy. There are no shortcuts. It takes time to plan, time to execute and time to manage.Producing a library of valuable content won&rsquo;t happen overnight. Set your goals appropriately and temper your expectations accordingly. Value consistent output over spurts of effort and a few months later you&rsquo;ll find yourself looking back on your work, amazed at what you&rsquo;ve produced.At Entwine Creative Group, we believe these elements form the foundation of any content marketing strategy, and we approach our content delivery with this in mind.Get in touch with us today and we&rsquo;ll help you build a content strategy that works.",

Answer the following questions and find out.</p><p> <strong>  1) Do you have any coaches in your life currently?  </strong></p><p> - People whose expertise and wisdom you are allowing to shape your views on different domains in your life, such as health, business, personal development?</p><p> <strong>  2) Do you try new things on a regular basis that you have learned?  </strong></p><p> - Are you jumping into Social Media or have you implemented a new workout program recently (assuming you are working out regularly.)?</p><p> <strong>  3) Do you regularly thank people in your life for the gifts of learning that they gave you?   </strong></p><p> - Have you recently thanked a friend for exposing you to new food, or your coach for opening up blogging to you (Thanks, Em!)?</p><p> <strong>  4) Do you have practices that you commit to on a regular basis?   </strong></p><p> - Practices such as exercise, writing, meditation, personal development, or professional reading?</p><p> If most of your answers to the above are no, I am going to suggest that your biggest leadership challenge is not others, it is you. <strong>  To be a leader, learning to lead yourself is key. </strong> If you are not trying new ideas or leading yourself into a new future, how can you expect those who are your followers do do so? To be the master of one&rsquo;s self, one has to allow another to be their teacher. So, are you coachable? #leadershipflow</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s a simple question most men should be able to answer yet many men are still walking around with shirttails hanging down below their zippers. </strong> Right off the bat, I feel its necessary to give you a ladies opinion &ndash; this is not a good look gentlemen! Unless you want to look like an eight-year old boy who just finished recess, I suggest tucking in your shirt, especially button down dress shirts.</p><p> Choosing to tuck or untuck your shirt really depends on the length and the occasion. With that being said, here are two helpful tips to guide you on when its appropriate to expose your shirt bottom or keep it hidden in your pants:</p><p> <strong>  First, a good rule to go by is the length of your shirt. </strong> Whether it&rsquo;s a button down or polo shirt, if it hangs below your hips you should ALWAYS tuck it in. The key here is to make sure you look proportioned. If your shirt length hits above the hips, then feel free to exercise your right to untuck.</p><p> <strong>  Second, be mindful of the occasion. </strong> Ask yourself &lsquo;Is this (insert your event) suitable for untucking behavior?&rsquo; It should be a no brainer, but if you&rsquo;re attending a formal affair please for the love of common sense TUCK IN YOUR SHIRT. If you&rsquo;re in an office setting and the attire calls for suits or sport coats, then it&rsquo;s a tucking environment. If you&rsquo;re heading to a ball game with your guys, then feel free to rock out with your sark out.</p><p> Next time you&rsquo;re feeling unsure about tucking it in or letting it all hang out, remember the advice above to keep you looking sharp and takeaway these few friendly reminders:</p><p> DRESS SHIRTS:  <strong>  Always tuck </strong></p><p> CASUAL BUTTON DOWNS:  <strong>  Tuck or untuck </strong></p><p> POLOS:  <strong>  Tuck or untuck </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Over the years I&rsquo;ve worked with plenty of financial advisors who have expressed interest in making a transition so they can launch or join an RIA.  And for all the talent, drive and success any particular advisor may have displayed, sometimes their best strategic option is to simply stay put. </p><p> I&rsquo;m not referring to nerves.  In anticipation of such an undertaking, it&rsquo;s natural for some advisors to have second thoughts or repeatedly validate the risk-reward proposition.  I would suggest that behavior is healthy, actually.  But there are signals, some overt and some subtle, that should prompt an advisor to stop the process, delay the transition or opt not to engage in at all.</p><p> Here are telltale signs your best move is no move:</p><p> <strong>  1. You Don&rsquo;t Have the Right Supporting Cast </strong></p><p> Key personnel are essential to the delivery of your current value proposition.  Note I didn&rsquo;t say what you want to deliver in the future.  If there&rsquo;s a need on your team that is critical to your early success, take the time to find that person before you move.</p><p> <strong>  2. Client Accounts and/or Technology Benefit from Immediate Attention </strong></p><p> Typically, an advisor consolidates client accounts and selects new technology post-transition.  For those advisors that are able, like an IBD rep for example, consolidating client accounts, transitioning from commission-based products to fee-based alternatives, and evaluating and implementing their own portfolio accounting system in advance of a move can provide productivity gains and make the transition experience smoother.</p><p> <strong>  3. Personal or Financial Stresses are at a High-Water Mark </strong></p><p> Personal and financial situations may never be ideal.  Enduring a transition will certainly raise the stress level though.  Your current personal and financial situation should be able to sustain itself in a tested environment for a minimum of 6-12 months.</p><p> <strong>  4. Integral Parties are Not Prepared </strong></p><p> Your reasons for making a transition are legitimate and your plan of execution is worthy.  You are prepared yet another party associated with this transition is not.  Of highest concern is the firm you are joining or custodian you&rsquo;ve selected.  Ensure all parties vital to your success are ready to go.</p><p> <strong>  5. Misalignment Among Business Philosophy and/or Client Needs </strong></p><p> Despite the growing trend of independence, it&rsquo;s not right for everyone.  The way you approach your business, your offering, and the client profiles you serve should thrive as a result of a move.  If conceptually you cannot envision net positive gains, you likely won&rsquo;t realize them in practice either.</p><p> <strong>  6. You Don&rsquo;t Know Why You&rsquo;re Making A Change </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re not clear in your purpose and plan, take all the time you need.  &ldquo;Change without purpose is chaos.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  7. You Are Inexplicably Uncomfortable </strong></p><p> Trust Your Gut.  Be clear about your goal and how best to attain it.  Evaluate your transition plan and validate with partners and trusted advisors.  Revisit your people, value proposition and your probability of success.  Identify the source of the anxiety.</p><p> <strong>  8. You Want Out </strong></p><p> The most successful moves are typically not about fleeing where you are but seizing enhanced opportunities elsewhere.  Be certain you are making a move for lasting and rewarding reasons. </p><p> <strong>  9. You Aren&rsquo;t Being Honest With Yourself </strong></p><p> This applies to one&rsquo;s aptitude, commitment, offering, opportunity for success, etc.  If you question any of these elements, you are better served acknowledging reality and course-correcting.</p><p> <strong>  10. Keeping Up With the Jones&rsquo; </strong></p><p> When advisors make moves it often spurs headlines.  The courage, the vision, the monetization &ndash; whatever appeals to you &ndash; can be contagious.  Be sure any move is about YOUR reasons, not somebody else&rsquo;s.</p><p>  </p>",

    "title": "The Extra Mile or The Last Mile?",
    "link": "the-extra-mile-or-the-last-mile",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Which is more important: the last mile or the extra mile? </strong> <br/> <br/> A couple months ago, I wrote about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/12/first-or-last-impression-which-one-is.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first and last impressions  </a> </u> , posing a similar question there:  which is more important?  <br/> <br/> Today I'm wondering about the last mile and the extra mile. Which one should you focus on more? Which is more impactful to the customer experience? Which one creates  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/06/is-yours-cult-brand.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  raving fans </a> ? Or, at least, happy customers?  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Let's start with some definitions. </strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>  What do we mean by \"the extra mile?\"  </strong> According to FreeDictionary.com, to go the extra mile means: to try harder to please someone or to get the task done correctly; to do more than one is required to do to reach a goal; to make more effort than is expected of you. Of course, we knew that; we talk about that all the time when we describe what companies do to delight or to deliver a superior customer experience. Stan Phelps gives us a lot of examples of how great companies consistently go the extra mile for their customers and their employees. <br/> <br/> <strong>  What about \"the last mile?\" </strong>  This is a phrase mentioned much less often in our world; hence, my question, is it as important as the extra mile? According to Investopedia, the last mile is: a phrase used in the telecommunications and technology industries to describe the technologies and processes used to connect the end customer to a communications network. I suppose I'll equate this to doing it right, getting it there. Or quite simply, delivering at the moment of fulfillment, as in, making sure customers get what they expected to get. So, in the telecom industry example, the phone lines come into my home, and I can make and receive calls. There's no delight there. It works; it just does what it's supposed to do. I'm happy. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Do you see my dilemma?  </strong> <br/> <br/> There are those who argue that companies don't need to put forth the extra effort - or go the extra mile - to delight, that they should simply spend more time just getting things right. In the HBR article,  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/07/stop-trying-to-delight-your-customers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stop Trying to Delight Customers  </a> </u> , the authors state:  <br/> <br/> According to conventional wisdom, customers are more loyal to firms that go above and beyond. But our research shows that exceeding their expectations during service interactions (for example, by offering a refund, a free product, or a free service such as expedited shipping) makes customers only marginally more loyal than simply meeting their needs. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Does that then support focusing on the last mile? </strong> <br/> <br/> Forrester has stated that there are three requirements of a great customer experience; it must be...</p><li> enjoyable</li><li> easy</li><li> effective <br/>  </li><p> So, it's enjoyable; customer effort is low; and it meets your needs. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Does that also support focusing on the last mile? Or both? </strong> <br/> <br/> I have to draw some parallels to my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/12/first-or-last-impression-which-one-is.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first/last impression post  </a> </u> , in which I said: You won't get one without the other. There won't be a last impression if you don't get the first impression right. You know what you need to do. <br/> <br/> Which is most important? Well, I think you can't have one without the other. You can't go the extra mile if you haven't completed the last mile. <br/> <br/> <strong>  You know what you need to do. </strong> <br/> <br/> There are no traffic jams along the extra mile. -Roger Staubach</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  \"Beware the barrenness of a busy life style.\"  <br/>  &mdash;Socrates 470BC-399BC Greek Athenian Philosopher </strong></p><p> One of my passions is to find ways for teams to be more organized, manage time more efficiently, and ultimately be more productive. There are many things out of our control, but you can master how you choose to spend your time.  Wasting time, being unorganized, or just down right lazy impacts your peers and your clients.</p><p> Make simple changes starting today to transform your work and personal life. Share these time management hacks with your team to increase productivity, reduce stress, and reap the benefits of effective time management.</p><p> <strong>  1. DO NOT Work Longer Hours </strong></p><p> More work hours does not equate to more productivity. The answer to overwhelm is not spinning more plates or doing more; it&rsquo;s prioritizing and defining the few things that can fundamentally change your business and life.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t prioritize, everything seems urgent and important. Every day before you leave the office write down the 3 to 5 most important tasks you want to accomplish the following day.</p><p> <strong>  2. Learn Unitasking </strong></p><p> I love unitasking because it works. In fact, one of our clients recently told us that unitasking is her new mantra for the year! Multi-tasking is no longer something to brag about. It is unproductive, results in errors, and wastes time. Unitasking is the new skill set to learn and will take practice. If you focus on one project or task at a time, your productivity and quality of work will improve.</p><p> <strong>  3. Try Timeboxing </strong></p><p> Long tasks are just plain hard to get into. It feels like you&rsquo;ll never get done and feelings of stress and overwhelm creep in. <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/10/timeboxing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   timeboxing  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  4. DO NOT Check Email Constantly </strong></p><p> If you make one major change this month, resolve to not check your email constantly. While email is an important and valuable tool, the sad fact is people let their inbox rule their day. Set specific times to respond to e-mails. Focus on things early in the day that move your business and daily goals forward. E-mail can wait until you&rsquo;ve completed at least one of your critical to-do items.</p><p> <strong>  5. Create Standard Operating Procedures </strong></p><p> Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) replicate best practices by describing detailed instructions on specific work processes. Create an SOP for your day and stick to it. You will find by having an organized list of daily duties will help keep you focused and finish routine tasks more quickly. Download our <u>  <a href=\"http://ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ironstone-sop-template.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Standard Operating Procedure Template  </a> </u> to get started.</p><p> <strong>  6. DO NOT Look at a Big To-Do List </strong></p><p> Collect your thoughts and annual goals in one location and then break them down into 90-day chunks. Big goals are achieved when they are clear and time sensitive; set deadlines for everything.</p><p> <strong>  7. Write Down Anything That Distracts You </strong></p><p> Have you ever been working on a big project and all of sudden you have random thoughts about new ideas, your plans for the weekend, or what you need to fix for dinner tonight? The point is, write down anything that distracts you. This will clear your head and you will be able to think more clearly about the project at hand.</p><p> I have incorporated these tips into my day and found a drastic change in increased productivity, less stress, and additional time.  Instead of putting this article in your &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to this later pile,&rdquo; write down the tips and keep them in a spot where you can look at them daily. Go a step further by incorporating all or some of the tips into your business and personal life. By doing so, I hope you will achieve the same results I have. Who doesn&rsquo;t want more time and less stress!!</p><p> The foundation of our Performance Coaching and Consulting Programs are based on Ironstone's <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/about-us/the-fundamental-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Fundamental 4&trade; </a> , which is essential to design, develop, and sustain a successful business.

    "content": "<p> From time to time, it&rsquo;s a good idea to update your site to reflect  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-web-design-mistakes-small-businesses-make/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   modern web design trends  </a> </u> . Internet users come to expect certain aesthetics, responsiveness and themes. If your website was created 10 years ago, it&rsquo;s probably looking pretty dated now. Everyone has different preferences and you can never please every visitor, but these 8 design aesthetics should give you a few cutting edge ideas if you&rsquo;re looking for something different. One thing you must never forget is that the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-reasons-to-redesign-your-website/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   user experience  </a> </u>  needs to be the most important factor in your overall design.We didn&rsquo;t include &ldquo;responsiveness&rdquo; as a trend solely for the reason that it&rsquo;s been a trend for a while now and we feel that all NEW web development should be responsive. Having a mobile friendly website that looks awesome across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop, etc) is crucial for digital branding in 2015 and beyond. Please keep that in mind as you read the 8 web design trends below. <img alt=\"\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8-Web-Design-Trends-2015.png\" width=\"1200\"/> <strong>  1. Background Hero Images &amp; Full Screen Videos Instead of Sliders </strong> Sliders are a great way to showcase blog content, portfolios, videos, photography or news stories. Most sliders work on auto-scroll, allowing users to pause, stop or click through the different landing pages at any point in the slide. While still wildly popular, some designers are beginning to move away from sliders to focus on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/29/10-web-design-trends-can-expect-see-2014/4/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   oversized &ldquo;hero&rdquo; areas  </a> </u>  featuring a large graphic header with a minimal amount of text. Large blurred backgrounds are popular among businesses like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Paypal  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://designmodo.com/design-type-photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   others  </a> </u>  because they tell a story and capture the imagination. <a href=\"http://designmodo.com/website-video-backgrounds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Video </a>  is another great way to keep visitors on your site longer and prevent your page from growing stale.  <u>  <a href=\"http://y.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Y.Co Yacht  </a> </u>  tells their story through a full-screen video that aims to be just as fast-paced and exhilarating as a ride on one of their luxury boats.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.borngroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Born Group  </a> </u>  has an awesome moving background that transfixes visitors.So, are &ldquo;sliders&rdquo; dead? Not so fast, we say! One reason our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/seo-friendly-wordpress-web-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   web design  </a> </u>  team at Mod Girl opts out of utilizing sliders on some of our projects is the extra page load time it requires. Using WordPress, we have to be very careful at what sliders we utilize, if any, as website speed is a crucial factor these days as no one likes waiting for a slow website &mdash; not to mention Google is now using site speed as a major factor in SEO. With that said, we still like using sliders on particular web design projects.Check out the beautiful slider on Mod Girl&rsquo;s latest web design project,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.davidhalpernmd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tampa Bay Plastic Surgery, Inc.  </a> </u> <img alt=\"\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1a.png\" width=\"600\"/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-slider-2-dr-halpern.png\" width=\"600\"/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1c.png\" width=\"600\"/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1d.png\" width=\"600\"/> <strong>  2. Parallax Scrolling </strong> Parallax scrolling is a neat technique where the foreground images move faster than the background images. This technique can be used to breathe life into your page and add &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor. It&rsquo;s perfect for storytelling on single page websites. This was a hot trend in 2013, but a lot of business owners went overboard. This year, we&rsquo;ll see more emphasis on multimedia product showcases and less text. Personally, we think parallax is fun&hellip; but  <u>  <a href=\"http://danwin.com/2013/01/infinite-scroll-fail-etsy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   infinite scrolling  </a> </u>  is not! <img alt=\"\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-sweez.jpg\" width=\"930\"/> <strong>  3. Slide-out Menus </strong> <img alt=\"\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3-slideoutmen.jpg\" width=\"580\"/> Some people find navigation bars to be too cluttered. Web design in 2015 has gravitated toward greater simplicity, so the slide-out menu bars (like Microsoft has implemented on Windows 8) are an extension of that desire. Users can access the menu by toggling to the top or side of the screen. These menus are especially great for mobile web designs, where space can be an issue. My newly designed #8ways site, which you are reading now, has a slide-out menu on the mobile version. If you are reading this from your mobile phone or tablet you can look in the top right corner, click on the &ldquo;Menu&rdquo; button and you will see the navigation menu slide out.Here is a screenshot of what my slide-out menu looks like on this #8ways site, once you click the &ldquo;Menu&rdquo; button: <img alt=\"\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-slide-out-menu-web-design-trend.png\" width=\"470\"/> <strong>  4. Fonts with Personality </strong> Long gone are the days where all sites use boring Arial, Helvetica or Times New Roman fonts. Designers realize that quirky fonts are a great way to add personality and style to a website, without adding clutter or bulky elements that may slow down loading time. This doesn&rsquo;t ring true for every industry, as it would look odd to have a funky font on a serious corporate or healthcare website. Whereas industries that have room for a bit more creativity are embracing new, fun fonts. Check out  <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2271763-Google-Font-Combinations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   these latest Google fonts  </u>  .  </a> <img alt=\"\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-fonts.png\" width=\"520\"/> <strong>  5. Flat Design </strong> Say goodbye to gradients, beveled edges, reflections and drop shadows. Apple&rsquo;s iOS7 brought us the first glimpse of &ldquo;flat design&rdquo; as we know it. Flat designs often use bright colors to jazz up a simple layout. It has been the rave for most of 2014 and we anticipate many designers to continue utilizing flat design well in to 2015. <img alt=\"\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6-flat-design.jpg\" width=\"600\"/> <strong>  6. Videos Instead of Text </strong> Web design is simplifying. Professional caliber videos are getting easier to produce. Not to mention, attention spans are shorter. The marriage of all three ideas brings us to an increased focus on using video to tell a quick story. Sometimes videos can slow down a page&rsquo;s loading time, so they should be used judiciously, but they can work great to explain a complicated topic or make a quick impression. For instance,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   General Electric  </a> </u>  uses a lot of videos to give information on their products. Mod Girl uses a video on our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   homepage  </a> </u>  with a strong call to action. <img alt=\"\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/7-coin.png\" width=\"520\"/> <strong>  7. Hand Drawn Illustrations </strong> Illustrated images, icons, typography and backgrounds add uniqueness and creativity to your site beyond the usual business stock images business site visitors see all too often. Like photos, illustrations are going big and bold in 2014 and 2015. A lot of retro and vintage styles have been coming back in vogue. This trend is not new to 2014, but it&rsquo;s certainly not waned in popularity at all. This style won&rsquo;t work for every business &mdash; especially if you&rsquo;re a super corporate B2B, but it works for any business looking to tell a creative story with their website. <img alt=\"\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8-hand-drawn.jpg\" width=\"580\"/> <strong>  8. Cards </strong> If you look carefully, you&rsquo;ll find that information is often arranged in little &ldquo;business cards&rdquo; or &ldquo;tiles.&rdquo; Websites like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/blog/why-cards-are-the-future-of-the-web/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google, Twitter, Pinterest and Spotify  </a> </u>  are all using this web design trend to share information in easy, digestible ways. Some may say cards can be a little cluttered looking, but others argue that it&rsquo;s intuitive and follows how mobile apps are displayed. <img alt=\"\" height=\"734\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9-cards-1024x734.png\" width=\"1024\"/> <strong>  Need a website design consultant? </strong> I can help! Whether you have your own team of developers and just need some help with the initial phasing like design, layout, optimization, keyword research OR you are looking to outsource it all.

It is far easier for them to sit back, have a few meetings about how they will engage the next generation of workers and drink the proverbial kool-aid that is being served by experts about the doom and gloom of having no one qualified to hire in the near future.

Stop the presses, if you don&rsquo;t take home that $80,000 bonus this year. Clutch your pearls, because now there is a change in perspective at all levels and it isn&rsquo;t monochromatic. The&rdquo;war for talent&rdquo; has never been about a true shortage, but about a deliberate haughtiness we have in this country about who can get the job done and changing with the times. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, when we speak about STEM jobs, there is something to be said for the lack of people educated and prepared to enter technical fields in the future. However, for everything else, I believe we are sitting on capable pools of talent some of which have been unemployed long-term. Additionally, there are others who are employed and yearning for development, a chance to demonstrate their abilities or the unique opportunity to shift gears and do something a little different. Your employees are tired of &ldquo;no&rdquo; being your answer. The deafening silence where career progression questions never get answered is a silent talent killer as well.</p><p> If you subscribe to the idea that all employees are expendable expect to be at war for talent, but don&rsquo;t blame anyone for your failed talent management and business efforts, but yourself. Stop relying on the next trumped-up, doom and gloom workforce catastrophe as an excuse for your unwillingness to deviate from &ldquo;what you have always done&rdquo;. Your business will fail if you don&rsquo;t start creating talent management practices that focus on the humans that are powering your operation. Innovation and adaptability can be lonely places when you are trying to forge a new path, but it is imperative to your continued success in the future. Take a closer look at your workforce. There could be missed opportunities, future leaders poised for a challenge, or works-in-progress that just need a little coaching. Put your talent first by investing in them and providing them with opportunities to do work they love -while growing professionally. They will appreciate you for it and spread the word which can only help you escape the fate of being a &ldquo;war for talent&rdquo;casualty.</p><p> Check out @KPMG &lsquo;s War For Talent Infographic <a href=\"http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/war-for-talent/Documents/war-for-talent.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> : </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;ve spent any time at all working for yourself, you have almost surely come to grips with the fact that a perpetual workday is no way to go. If you don&rsquo;t take time off&mdash;even just evenings and weekends&mdash;you&rsquo;ll burn out before you&rsquo;ve even begun. </p><p> Here are a few suggestions on how us entrepreneurial folk can reclaim our weekends.</p><li> <strong>  Walk away. </strong> Stand up and walk away from your computer. It&rsquo;s that simple. The more distance you get between yourself and your machine, the harder it will be for you to jump back online &ldquo;to check on one more thing&rdquo;. (It takes one to know one.) For me, having office space out of the house is the ideal &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; solution.</li><li> <strong>  Get away. </strong> To be honest, I have a hard time taking a break unless I&rsquo;m completely off the grid. The off-the-grid experience doesn&rsquo;t have to be extravagant. It can be a drive to see family, an overnight camping excursion, or a day trip to the local winery. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a good book series and a large pot of coffee. Find what it takes to give your brain a real break and do it.</li><li> <strong>  Put it away. </strong> The cell phone, that is. Have you seen these sleeping bags for your iPhone? Not only are they adorable, but I imagine they really work! Who would want to disturb their wee little phone from a peaceful slumber? Stash that phone somewhere, sleeping bag or not, and go play!</li><li> <strong>  Plan a way. </strong> Implementing the above suggestions will be totally worthless if you haven&rsquo;t planned ahead. If your clients assume you work 24/7, playing hooky isn&rsquo;t an option. A few tips on that front:</li><li> <strong>  Protect your time. </strong> If you are the team member who establishes timelines, make a point not to count weekend days as work days.</li><li> <strong>  Track your time. </strong> If you have a log of your hours to reference when outlining new work, you&rsquo;ll be able to estimate more accurately and avoid overloading your schedule. (I use  <a href=\"https://www.getharvest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Harvest </a>  to do this.)</li><li> <strong>  Set a precedent. </strong> If you&rsquo;re known to take phone calls and send emails over the weekend, that&rsquo;s what will be expected. Stop it! Being a free agent should mean you have more freedom, not less. You&rsquo;re the one responsible for molding the job that you&rsquo;ll love or hate, so be mindful of the precedents you set along the way. They will come back to bite you.</li><li> <strong>  Communicate your plans. </strong> As always, let your clients know what&rsquo;s up if taking the weekends off is a big change for you or if you plan to take an extra day or two on one end of the holiday. </li><p> <br/> <strong>  Entrepreneurs, reclaim your weekend! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently had a conversation with someone who just changed customer-facing jobs. Beyond the dynamics of salary, benefits, and the myriad of other factors that influenced her decision to move on to the next professional opportunity, the way she described her former position stuck with me: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like that I couldn&rsquo;t see customer issues through to resolution.&rdquo;  A customer would bring a problem to her attention and she, per policy, would be required to pass it up the customer resolution chain to be handled&hellip;or not, as was sometimes the case.  As someone who takes exemplary initiative, she was dissatisfied operating within a system that didn&rsquo;t allow her to build relationships with customers by personally delivering solutions in those critical service-recovery moments.  Most discouraging was her realization that when those in the ranks above her did not handle issues promptly, appropriately, or at all, the customer perceived her to be unresponsive, apathetic, unmotivated, or lazy.  Understandably, this protocol would drain the morale out of most anybody.</p><p> A respected colleague of mine, Micah Solomon, author of High-Tech High-Touch Customer Servicewrites on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2013/10/28/four-seasons-and-ritz-carlton/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes.com  </a> </u> , &ldquo;Standards help ensure that every part of your service reflects the best way your company knows to perform it&mdash;a prescription that your autonomously performing employees can then feel free to adapt to suit the needs and wishes, expressed or unexpressed, of the customers they&rsquo;re actually facing at the moment.&rdquo;</p><p> Yes, there is a degree of trust and confidence you must have in your front-line staff to empower them with autonomy.  Sometimes the endless damage control procedures that seem to involve the entire chain of command are simply control mechanisms &ndash; an effort to ensure that your business&rsquo; service standards are met reasonably consistently, regardless of who was working the front desk.  In other words &ndash; they are thought to prevent folks from going rouge and thus screwing anything up too badly.  You can see how demeaning this thinking can be to the engaged employees who are on the floor, behind the desk, on the phone &ndash; interacting with customers most regularly.</p><p> Ask yourself:  Are your service standards static expressions that describe an ideal customer interaction?  Or, do your standards provide a framework to help front-line employees discern how they can personally and promptly make it right for a customer in the not-so-ideal interactions?  Standards that provide employees with functional tools to guide their judgment when faced with issues are a relatively low-risk, high-reward way to improve both your customer and employee experiences.</p><p> If you hire talent, set guard rails as to what is acceptable, and then let your team members improvise to solve problems &ndash; YOU, YOUR team members, and YOUR customers WIN!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  If your goal is to build trust, strengthen your reputation and attract business, then there is one time-tested strategy that works best: giving. </strong></p><p> Giving is simply the best way to get value from your online social networking activities. Not self-promoting. Not buying advertisements. Not clever search engine optimization. Just giving.</p><p> Here are 7 ways to inform your online persona with the spirit of giving.</p><p> <strong>  Invest quality time. </strong></p><p> Start by investing your most scarce and valuable resource: your time. If you don&rsquo;t invest a certain amount of quality time into the people that make up your online network, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to get anything back from them.</p><p> <strong>  Read what others share. </strong></p><p> Use that time to read what people in your network are sharing and add thoughtful comments when you can. Everyone that shares in social networks likes to receive feedback and engagement. So give them some and you&rsquo;ll get some back.</p><p> <strong>  Share content that moves you. </strong></p><p> Consistently sharing the best content you can find is one of the best ways to give and create value for your network. Over time, people in your network will pay you back for sharing great content by not ignoring you.</p><p> <strong>  Give credit where it&rsquo;s due. </strong></p><p> Everything you read online is created by someone or shared by someone in your network. Everything. You should never miss an opportunity to give someone credit for bringing an article to your attention or creating it. They will reciprocate.</p><p> <strong>  Pay attention. </strong></p><p> Really listen to what people are talking about and sharing in your network for two reasons. First, you may actually learn something valuable. Second, if you pay others with your attention, you will earn theirs as well. In the influence economy, people literally pay you with their attention.</p><p> <strong>  Be generous of spirit. </strong></p><p> Demonstrate patience and give people the benefit of the doubt. Avoid online arguments and agree to disagree. There will always be online trolls and haters &ndash; ignore them and take the high ground.</p><p> <strong>  Help others. </strong></p><p> Whether you answer someone&rsquo;s question with your own knowledge or point them in the right direction, helping others help themselves is the highest form of charity and builds goodwill.</p><p> As ironic as it sounds, giving without the expectation of getting anything back is the key to getting the most from social networks. The key here is not acting like you are expecting a return or a quid pro quo of any kind. We all benefit when we contribute to building a robust community around where we live and what we do for a living.</p><p> <strong>  So, stop focusing on what you&rsquo;re not getting from social media and learn to be a giver and community builder within your social networks. The benefits will amaze you. </strong></p>",

    "link": "complaints-where-is-your-exposure-in-reality",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Whenever the topic of the &ldquo;advice process&rdquo;, or compliance, comes up most advisers imagine themselves as the plane: </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-03-at-9.58.42-AM.png\" width=\"513\"/></p><p> Sure it is a drag for everyone involved &ndash; including clients &ndash; when compliance requires a bunch of stuff being put into writing that nobody involved in the process actually is terribly interested in.  But generally (in my experience anyway) the regulators are not actually hurling missiles at good advisers.  They are definitely on the hunt for the bad guys, but they aren&rsquo;t trying to shoot down the good ones.  They just need to check every so often to be sure who the good ones are.</p><p> Back to the client engagement however: Most clients just want to get on with making their investments, or getting their tax problem sorted, or putting the damned insurance in place!  &ldquo;Just get it done already&rdquo; is the prevailing attitude of most clients, right?</p><p> But here is the thing: it is only true that nobody cares about the process or the paperwork when everyone is content.  </p><p> As soon as there is an expression of dissatisfaction by a client then the process becomes really relevant and useful&hellip;</p><p> In amongst all the process and paperwork though there is one critical point of exposure for an adviser.  To cover off this point of exposure you need to be mindful of the 3 key &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; principles &ndash;  and actually I contend that when you get right down to it these three principles are actually the only 3 things that matter when it comes to creating a great advice process.</p><p> <strong>  1.  The clients interests are paramount </strong></p><p> <strong>  2.  Recommended actions are suitable. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3.  You can evidence these first 2 points. </strong></p><p> It is inevitable that in the event of a complaint the fiduciary role will be challenged, as it is inevitable that every adviser will incur a risk of conflict.  Even those who are selling time and expertise by the hour will be challenged at time of complaint&hellip;.&rdquo;the plan was so big and cumbersome because you were trying to pad up fees&rdquo;&hellip;.&rdquo;you made it more complicated than it needed to be so you could charge more &ndash; and that is why it didn&rsquo;t work!&rdquo;</p><p> Understanding that the fiduciary role will be challenged every time (in practical terms), and understanding also that in the real world virtually every single piece of advice given involves compromise on the part of the client, the way to ensure there is an ironclad link between &ldquo;placing the clients interests first&rdquo; and &ldquo;ensuring suitability&rdquo; is to ensure the clients priorities and compromises are captured, and kept.  Professionals generally have no problem providing comprehensive and detailed recommendations &ndash; but clients usually have a problem with either paying for all the solutions to be put in place, or fully doing the tasks required to implement the recommendations.  So the advice &ndash; or recommendations &ndash; are usually compromised in some fashion by clients.</p><p> <strong>  THAT is where point 3 comes in&hellip;.being able to evidence that there was compromise. </strong></p><p> To most clients most of the time disclosure doesn&rsquo;t matter.  Written plans don&rsquo;t matter much mostly.  Most of the advice process we work with doesn&rsquo;t actually matter much to most clients most of the time, because clients deal with someone they trust.  40 pages of guff isn&rsquo;t going to change whether they will work with you, as by the time they get the massive written report they have already decided they trust you.</p><p> Having said all that, of course we have to comply with the rules of the road when driving, and of course we have to comply with the rules of engagement when advising.  While grappling with the rules of engagement and making sure you are compliant remember though that the absolutely essential parts of that engagement process are being able to demonstrate later that you placed the clients interests first, and that your advice was suitable, especially in light of any priorities or compromises introduced by the client.  Frankly it shouldn&rsquo;t matter whether you evidence this with a 40 page report or a 40 minute video recording of the entire recommendation discussion with the client.  The format of the evidence does only matter to regulators &ndash; it wouldn&rsquo;t really matter inside a courtroom I would venture to suggest.  Evidence is evidence.</p><p> <strong>  Evidence of suitability, however you capture and keep it, is the thing that keeps the bogeys off your tail. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Bitcoin is a bit of a head-scratcher. </strong> Its US dollar value has fallen about 30% year-to-date, and has sunk about 80% since peaking in late 2013. The digital currency is a long way from mainstream consumer adoption. Yet, its enthusiasts have had some reasons to be optimistic about bitcoin's long-term prospects. </p><p> Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet provider, made headlines earlier this week when it closed on a $75 million  <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/coinbase-a-bitcoin-start-up-raises-75-million-in-vote-of-confidence/?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">  private financing deal </a> . Several prominent venture capitalists, including Coinbase investor Marc Andreessen, retain their faith in bitcoin's future. Coinbase gained further legitimacy with the participation in its latest financing round of several mainstream financial institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange (Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE)).</p><p> The disconnect between bitcoin's lousy recent trading performance, and its long-term potential to support a new payments infrastructure, has attracted media attention. An article published by CoinDesk nicely summarizes the 2015 outlook for bitcoin by underlining this seeming paradox: \" <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/state-bitcoin-2015-ecosystem-grows-despite-price-decline/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ecosystem Grows Despite Price Decline  </a> </u> .\" </p><p> Other bitcoin-related contradictions have emerged. Digital currencies have the potential to facilitate micropayments: small-denomination transactions that would be too costly to process with traditional credit card and inter-bank money transfer systems. Should they succeed, micropayment platforms, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bitwall.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bitwall  </a> </u> , could offer bloggers and other publishers an opportunity to be compensated for their online content -- something that has been difficult to accomplish with traditional paywalls.</p><p> In a  <u>  <a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/01/22/bitcoin-and-blockchain/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent blog article  </a> </u> , Balaji Srinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, observed how bitcoin's role in enabling financial transactions is likely to evolve from small-scale to larger-scale applications. While \"bitcoin is good for transactions that are very small, very large, very fast, very international, and/or very automated ... it probably starts with low stakes, digital goods that the dollar can&rsquo;t colonize right now due to the requirements of credit card companies.\" </p><p> Yet, for all of the potential for bitcoin to facilitate small-denomination payments, consumers still can't readily find small merchants in their neighborhood, like restaurants and stores, that accept bitcoin. Rather, it's been large merchants, like Microsoft (MSFT) and Dell, that have drawn the attention of bitcoin watchers by announcing their acceptance of the digital currency as a form of payment.</p><p> For the time being, the practical applications of bitcoin may be difficult to explain to those unfamiliar with the world of digital currencies. Try explaining this to your parents (or friends, or spouse, or children): in order to spend bitcoin at a brick-and-mortar establishment, you first have to set up a digital wallet, and then find a merchant who accepts bitcoins. </p><p> For those already familiar with bitcoin-based services, like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.changetip.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ChangeTip  </a> </u> , and for other individuals who are already acquainted with the fintech tools being built on top of the bitcoin blockchain, its long-term potential is easier to understand. Of course, for diehard bitcoin enthusiasts, the long-term prospects for bitcoin's growth and acceptance have never seemed more promising. </p>",

    "content": "<p> When I walked into my new FBI office, I was viewed as a curiosity more than anything else. In the 1980&rsquo;s there weren&rsquo;t that many female FBI agents; everyone was polite but distant. I wore a suit and low-heeled shoes&mdash;despite what is shown in movies and TV shows, nothing looks more ridiculous than a woman tottering around on high heels while trying to balance the weight of a gun on her hip.I pretended not to notice when the guys grabbed their jackets and headed out the door for lunch without inviting me. I also pretended not to notice that I wasn&rsquo;t included in the informal squad debriefings about the direction the more important cases were headed. Our squad worked counterintelligence and espionage cases and only senior agents were considered experienced enough to be investigating the activities of an intelligence officer.It soon became evident that I would never get the opportunity as long as I was assigned the cases no one else on the squad wanted. If I wanted to work against a foreign spy, I&rsquo;d need to go out and find one myself. <strong>  I could have been bitter; instead, I let this situation show me how to be better. </strong> We&rsquo;ve all been in situations where it&rsquo;s hard to keep  <u>  a positive attitude </u> . When this happens, we have to intentionally choose to be positive because we all have an innate bias toward negativity. We process bad news faster than good news because our brain is survival driven. Survival is a tough, uncompromising business. For centuries our brain programmed us to &ldquo;Get lunch&mdash;not BE lunch.&rdquo;This explains why we&rsquo;re driven to avoid losses far more than we&rsquo;re driven to pursue gains. When faced with uncertainty, the brain is wired to quit because it is reminded of past failures. And I&rsquo;ll admit that there were times I wanted to quit the squad and ask to be reassigned.It is at this point, however, that we can chose to be influenced by our negativity bias, or conversely, pursue positive thinking. The choice is ours. We can choose to learn from our experiences and be better, or feel sorry for ourselves and be bitter.I did not leave the squad. Instead, I made a choice to be proactive. I crafted an undercover proposal where I would be the undercover agent in a position to target foreign spies visiting companies with classified or proprietary information. FBI Headquarters loved it because it was a fresh and unique approach.Each one of us has a choice when faced with adversity and obstacles: we can either continue the negativity spiral or decide to move forward in other ways. Here are four suggestions: <strong>  1. Admit the negativity bias. </strong>  Once you acknowledge what is going on, it prompts you to move out of the  <u>  <a href=\"https://laraequy.com/blog/2013/05/26/how-to-develop-a-leadership-brain/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   emotional limbic system  </a> </u> , which is survival-driven, and into the cerebral brain, which is logical and thinking. Once you admit your negativity bias, it also helps you to identify partners and colleagues who can offer you support and assistance in your move. <strong>  2. Distinguish between &ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo; and &ldquo;positive thinking.&rdquo;  </strong> Your brain will dismiss wishful thinking as a threat to your survival. Positive thinking requires you to recognize a situation for what it actually is and then work within those confines. <strong>  3. Notice legitimate positives. </strong> Try to identify at least 3 times as many positives as negatives in your situation. Because of your negativity bias, it&rsquo;s important to consciously focus on positive experiences wherever they may be in your everyday life. <strong>  4. Focus and sustain. </strong> Once you have noticed (or created) a positive response, stay focused on it for 10-20 seconds. Basically,  <a href=\"http://addicted2success.com/success-advice/how-to-think-to-get-what-you-want/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   positive experiences have a cumulative effect  </u>    </a> over time. The longer and more often you do this, you will not only get more curious about those experiences, you&rsquo;ll actually be changing the structure of your brain. You will be creating new connections and building pathways associated with positive experiences.Whenever I am tempted to feel bitterness toward the way I was treated by my squad as a new agent, I remind myself that because of their cold shoulder, I dug deep and found positive attributes in myself that I may not have discovered otherwise. <strong>  Be better, not bitter. </strong> <strong>  Change one letter of the alphabet and change your life. </strong> How do you find positives in the middle of negative situations? How do you distinguish between positive thinking and wishful thinking?</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Our attitude is a combination of our thoughts, feelings and actions. </strong> Our attitude is our statement to the world of who we really are, regardless of what we say. Our life is merely a reflection of our attitudes.</p><p> Our attitude is the major factor in determining whether or not we will be successful in our careers and businesses, in the building of our families and in every other area of our lives.</p><p> <strong>  Positive thoughts are the seeds of positive attitudes </strong> , and positive attitudes are the seeds of positive results. A new attitude always produces a new result.</p><p> The Bible says &ldquo;You will be renewed by the renewing of your mind.&rdquo; To change who we are, we must change how we think. Prosperity definitely begins with a positive state of mind.</p><p> The thoughts we allow our mind to dwell on determine the way we feel, which ultimately is reflected in our actions.  Unless we choose our own thoughts, we end up following the thoughts of others. Only we can master our own thoughts.</p><p> We hold within ourselves everything that it takes to live a happy life. Happiness is not a destination but, rather, a way of traveling.</p><p> The elevation we can climb to in this life is determined solely by our attitude. Just like an airplane. When the attitude indicator indicates that the nose of the aircraft is pitched up, it means it is climbing and gaining altitude. What is your attitude indicator reading? Look up and you&rsquo;ll climb up.</p><p> A Harvard University study revealed that 85% of the reasons for success, accomplishments, promotions, etc. were a result of our attitudes and only 15% the result of technical expertise. Still, our present school system spends 90% of its education dollars on teaching facts, and only 10% on training our attitudes. Our mind is like a garden: it can give back only what we put into it.</p><p> <strong>  From Faith to Fear </strong></p><p> I knew something was wrong in May 1987 when thoughts of fear and unbelief began racing through my mind. I began to fear the worst for every area of my life. Every asset appeared as a potential liability. Every possible success loomed as a probable failure and every realizable gain looked like a possible loss. This was definitely my first experience with negativity and the fear of failure.</p><p> As I heard the prison doors of pessimism slam shut in my mind, my first fear was that I had been sentenced for life. Thank God, I found the keys to unlocking those gates, and I was once again able to experience the freedom of a positive mental attitude and faith.  I chose to give myself my own reprieve. So can you!  It is time to take control of your thoughts.</p><p> The Bible says, &ldquo;As a man thinks in his heart, so is he.&rdquo; Thinking in your heart is different than thinking in your head. Thinking in your head is theology &hellip; it&rsquo;s knowledge &hellip; it&rsquo;s know-how. Thinking in your heart is what you really believe &hellip; it&rsquo;s wisdom &hellip; it&rsquo;s your passions &hellip; your convictions &hellip; your inner-drive. It&rsquo;s your actions!</p><p> <strong>  5 Habits that Guarantee a Positive Attitude Every Day </strong></p><p> Here are five habits that will guarantee you have a positive attitude every single day in spite of your present circumstances, conditions, or environment.</p><li> <strong>  Wake up early.  </strong> I wake up every morning at 5:00AM. This my quiet time to read, pray, and exercise.</li><li> <strong>  The first thing to do is SMILE. </strong> Say to yourself &ldquo;This is the day the Lord has made, I will be happy in it.&rdquo;Then take in 30 deep breaths through your nose to get your lungs filled with oxygen.</li><li> <strong>  Get some physical exercise. </strong>  It does not matter how, but get your body moving for at least five-ten minutes. The best is some form of bouncing up and down to activate your pituitary gland. Then stretch your muscles.</li><li> <strong>  Sing in the shower. </strong>  Another ritual I have is singing in the shower. It really puts you and everyone else in the house in a better mood when there is music.</li><li> <strong>  Get the help you need. </strong>  I don&rsquo;t know why we make this one so hard. A goal represents new ground, new territory. That means you won&rsquo;t know how to traverse it. That reality is actually essential to establish compelling goals. Once you have a reason, the resources will start to materialize.</li><li> <strong>  Eat a hearty breakfast while listening to energizing podcast. </strong>  What we feed our minds is just as important as what we feed our bodies.</li><li> <strong>  Express your gratitude wherever you go. </strong>  Grateful people never have a negative attitude. People find an attitude of gratitude very attractive. <br/>  </li><p> \" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=I+hire+for+attitude%2C+knowing+I+can+always+train+for+skill.+-+Ben+Kubassek&amp;via=benkubassek&amp;related=benkubassek&amp;url=http://kubassek.com/attitude-big-difference-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I hire for attitude, knowing I can always train for skill.\" &ndash; Ben Kubasse </a> k</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  There are a million excuses NOT to have professional photos taken of you. </strong> You may think&hellip; I&rsquo;m not that important. It will be too expensive. Who wants to see my ugly mug anyway?</p><p> <strong>  NO MORE EXCUSES! </strong></p><p> What people don&rsquo;t consider is that the internet is a vast sea of faceless information. It can be cold and unfriendly with so much anonymity. With the MILLIONS of people advertising products and services online, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a saint from a scam.</p><p> Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to tell whether you&rsquo;re even dealing with a real person or not. Imagine yourself as the consumer. Isn&rsquo;t it nice to be reassured that the person in that photo with the friendly smile IS the person you&rsquo;re communicating with?</p><p> I recently had my professional photos taken and not only does it present me as being more professional, but also the experience was really fun! By no means am I a model or an attention seeker. In fact, attention can make me a bit uncomfortable at times. But I realize that showing potential clients that I am a put-together, professional, and friendly person can be best conveyed through a photo.</p><p> You want your image to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be great to work with and I&rsquo;ve got my act together!&rdquo;</p><p> Still a bit lost about the process? Here are 10 tips (in no particular order) to make your photo shoot experience a success:</p><p> <strong>  1. Make Sure You&rsquo;re Comfortable </strong> &ndash; The vibe between you and your photographer is much more important than you think. Someone that makes you feel at ease and creates an environment where you can relax and be yourself really shows through in your photos. Have fun! It looks good on you.</p><p> <strong>  2. You Better Shop Around </strong> &ndash; Photographer&rsquo;s rates come in all shapes and sizes. Some offer packages; while others attach stipulations as far as the use of the photos go. Just because a photographer is affordable, doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t any good. On the other hand, just because they&rsquo;re expensive doesn&rsquo;t make them Annie Leibovitz.</p><p> Got a budget that&rsquo;s really small? See if the photographer is willing to arrange a work exchange agreement. For example, if you&rsquo;re a writer, write some copy for their website in exchange. A baker? Offer a free cake for an event. Personal trainer? Throw in a few free sessions.</p><p> <strong>  3. Set The Scene </strong> &ndash; Consider what message you are trying to convey in your photos when choosing a location to shoot. An urban backdrop works really well for marketing and business. If you do something more holistic, like teach yoga, outdoors in nature is ideal.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also great to see you in your natural habitat. If you&rsquo;re a hair stylist, have some action shots in the salon. Chefs should be cooking in the kitchen. Artists can be painting in their studio.</p><p> <strong>  4. Consider Outside Forces </strong> &ndash; If you are shooting outdoors take a few things into consideration. Time of day is very important! While it sounds great to shoot on a sunny day, that can cause squinting and overly bright photos (and sweating, ugh!). Early morning or late afternoon when the sun isn&rsquo;t at its highest makes for beautiful light. An overcast works well. Believe it or not, it was pouring an hour before we took my photos, and there were even a few sprinkles during. But the lighting was beautiful!</p><p> <strong>  5. What To Wear </strong> &ndash; Obviously something that is flattering and makes you feel awesome! Just like you set the scene with the location, wardrobe does the same thing. More formal clothing for more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; photos, and casual for creative fields. If you&rsquo;re a CPA, leave the flip-flops at home.</p><p> People tend to gravitate towards solids for photos, but subtle patterns look really nice as well. Choose a pattern that isn&rsquo;t distracting like a small polka dot or even an animal print that isn&rsquo;t too loud. Varying the texture in your outfit also adds some dimension.</p><p> Select at least 3 outfit choices and try all of them during your shoot. The way things look on camera is much different than in person. Trust me, you&rsquo;ll be happy you did!</p><p> <strong>  6. Take Care Of That Hair </strong> &ndash; If there is ever a time to splurge on a $20 blow-out, this is it! Cut and color should be no more than a week or two old so everything looks vibrant. If you choose to style your own hair, definitely do a practice run to see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> For men, get a haircut at least one week before. A haircut that looks too &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; can be noticeable and if the stylist makes a mistake, at least you have a week to get it fixed.</p><br /><p> <strong>  7. Consider Makeup </strong> - If you&rsquo;re really all thumbs when it comes to makeup, it&rsquo;s definitely a good idea to use a professional. If you&rsquo;re nervous it will be too dramatic, do a trial beforehand. Most makeup artists will do trials for less than the cost of an actual session. Want to save some cash? Enlist a friend whose makeup always looks good!</p><p> Gonna go it alone? I did! There are so many great tutorials on photo shoot makeup, and this video from www.MakeupGeek.com is my favorite. I used a lot of the advice in this video when I did my makeup for my shoot.</p><p> <strong>  8. Spray Tan </strong> &ndash; Ok, I&rsquo;m from New Jersey. I love a good spray tan. I can&rsquo;t help it. However, you can&rsquo;t deny that everyone does look better with a little glow. If you&rsquo;ve never had one, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. All those chemicals! And what if I end up orange? What if I look like Snooki? Fear not! Most cities have real spray tan salons that use organic solutions and they airbrush you by hand. (Yes, you have to be OK with getting mostly naked. You&rsquo;ll get over it.)</p><p> If done correctly the end result is beautiful. I had one done the day before my shoot and I&rsquo;d hardly say I look like an Oompah Loompah.</p><p> If you splurge on just one thing for your photo shoot, get a spray tan. I know it may sound crazy. But you&rsquo;ll thank me later! Who doesn&rsquo;t want to look like they just came back from vacation 10 lbs lighter? And when does that EVER happen in real life?!</p><p> <strong>  9. Examples, Examples, Examples </strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve written in previous posts about the importance of providing your graphic designer with direct links to sites you like when creating a website. It&rsquo;s the only way to get on the same page and for the designer to know exactly what you want. Well, the same sentiment rings true for photographers. Before your shoot, scour the internet for photos you like, ones to model your photos after. That way your photographer will have a much better idea of the lighting, setting, and overall message you are going for.</p><p> <strong>  10. Mirror, Mirror On The Wall </strong> &ndash; Especially if you don&rsquo;t have much experience having professional photos taken, this element can make or break your final results. Several times before your shoot, stand in front of your mirror (preferably when you&rsquo;re alone;) and get posing! Find the most flattering angles for your face and the most complimentary positions for your body. You&rsquo;d be surprised how much this helps! I know you&rsquo;ll feel silly, but after a bit of practice you&rsquo;ll be a pro.</p><p> <strong>  I can&rsquo;t stress enough what an important part of your marketing toolbox professional photos are. </strong> You&rsquo;ll use them on your website, business cards, in your email&hellip;just about everywhere! And I can guarantee that when you&rsquo;re ready to start the design on your next marketing material piece, the first question will be asked is&hellip; Do you have professional photos? And YOU will be able to say YES!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Last year, BuzzFeed launched <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/bigstories\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Big Stories  </u> </a> , a collection of traditional feature articles that are often more than 3000 words long. That a website that built its popularity around snackable content &ndash; bite-sized nuggets of information that can be quickly consumed &ndash; decided to get into serious journalism has been a subject of wonder for me at the time. Most of Buzzfeed&rsquo;s traffic comes from social media &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html\" target=\"_blank\">   75 percent of the site&rsquo;s referral traffic  </a> </u> ! &ndash; and its content is designed to be easily consumed and shared via those platforms and on mobile. Buzzfeed is famous for its viral lists, fun facts, and memes.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research worryingly shows that we have an average attention span of 8 seconds  </a> </u> , less than the one of a goldfish, and it&rsquo;s getting shorter with every passing decade. That&rsquo;s just enough time to read a few sentences. So why on earth would Buzzfeed want to invest in the development of long-form content?</p><p> Social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Vine, and Snapchat all offer ephemeral, fleeting and fluid experiences. Even the word &ldquo;twitter&rdquo; describes a short burst of trivial information. But do people really remember those messages, and are re-shares, +1s and likes a true measure of engagement when it only takes a few seconds to perform those actions? Even if we use them as success metrics, what is the brand or business impact of these engagements?  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/122490161165773\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook recognizes that users can like your content without actually clicking on it and consuming it  </a> </u> . The Reddit community uses the acronym &ldquo;tl;dr,&rdquo; or &ldquo;too long; didn&rsquo;t read&rdquo; for any content it considers being too meaty.</p><p> Case studies offered by social media platforms &ndash; obviously biased towards a business objective &ndash; are numerous, but I haven&rsquo;t found any independent research answering those questions, so I started looking elsewhere, specifically at websites that specialize in long-form content, and get it right.</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you all know about  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Medium/welcome-to-medium-735fbbc085a1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Medium </a> , the open blog-publishing platform created by Twitter founders, that specializes in social journalism, and one of the most recent examples of publishers as platforms. Their most popular content is 1600 words long on average  <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   and takes 7 long minutes to read  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the king of short content decided to launch a long-form content platform, and that this platform is thriving. This paradox and the success of the operation perfectly illustrates the Quartz curve, a model developed by Kevin Delaney,  <a href=\"http://qz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quartz </a> &rsquo;s Editor-in-Chief. The business news site refuses to publish articles in the typically news-friendly 500-800 word range. Based on their social media engagement internal metrics, they either publish short articles of less than 500 words, or in-depth features of 1200 words or more.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/quartz.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> This chart shows that people do read short, fast content online, but long-form, analytical pieces are also very popular. Stories that are between 500 and 800 words are too long to be easily sharable through social media,  <u>  the main source of referral traffic to content on the web </u> , and too short to provide real insights. This is crucial for marketers: to be successful with content marketing, brands should focus on both ends of the spectrum, and create snackable nuggets of information, as well as long-form pieces and deep-dives.</p><p> So should we just start creating more longer pieces content? Not quite. Even if quantity does play a role in terms of content popularity and social engagement, marketers still need to produce qualitative, informative, and useful pieces that target the right audience. As Stephen Kandell puts it,  <u>  mass is unfortunately fetishized </u> , as if that alone should be a selling point, because other pieces our audience appreciates are short. Making bad content long-form won&rsquo;t make it any better, and people won&rsquo;t be enticed to read and share content just because it is long: length has never been a virtue in itself.</p><h3> This soup tastes awful, but hey, at least there&rsquo;s a lot of it! &ndash; Steve Kandell, Features Director, BuzzFeed.</h3><p> <br/> Digital offers many opportunities to create engaging, non-linear pieces of content. Some great examples include  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/tomato-can-blues/\" target=\"_blank\">   the illustrated long-reads  </a> </u>  from the New York Times &ndash; incidentally, Mary Pilon, the award-winning journalist who wrote this particular story, announced a few days ago that she was being laid off as part of a company-wide restructuring &ndash; and, more recently, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://digitalstories.wellcomecollection.org/pathways/1-mindcraft/1-mesmer/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mindcraft experience  </a> </u>  created by the Wellcome Collection. The website is an immersive experience that uses music, video, animated images, and a seamless scrolling experience to deliver the content to the reader. It was featured in this week&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/digitalp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BBC Click show  </a> </u> , where its curator, Mike Jay, presented the concept of slow digital to describe our renewed appetite for long-form content. It takes a minimum of 20 minutes rather than 20 seconds to explore the content on the Mindcraft website, making it more similar to a novella than a blog post, and its non-linear nature makes it a different experience for each reader. It&rsquo;s an amazing and memorable experience that the audience is likely to share.</p><p> Beside, the rise in time-shifted reading apps such as Pocket, Instapaper and Readability makes it easier to consume long-form content whenever it&rsquo;s most convenient. Despite the success of short, snackable content, there is a market for high-impact, long-form pieces. Websites such as  <u>  <a href=\"https://atavist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Atavist  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Information  </a> </u>  have even created successful businesses out of it. Everyone loves a good story, and marketers should embrace the storytelling tools offered by digital platforms to create unique, engaging and useful content for their audience. It won&rsquo;t hurt at all if people need to scroll a little bit to read all of it. In fact, it might be even better.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A survey by The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fournaisegroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fournaise Marketing Group  </a> </u>  concluded that 73% of CEOs believe &ldquo;marketers lack business credibility and the ability to generate sufficient growth&rdquo;. The study provided a comparison between the perception of senior marketers and their colleagues in alternative areas of the business.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fournaisegroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Fournaise Marketing Group  </a> </u>  found that 91% of CEOs trust their CFO and CIOs; in comparison, only 20% trust their marketers. If 80% of CEOs do not trust their marketing team, an average of only 20% of marketers are amplifying the same message as their senior management team.</p><p> Below are three steps for improvement, these steps should be considered in addition to a  <u>  marketing strategy optimised for ROI </u> . The first contributing factor to this issue is a lack of communication; the second is a company-wide misunderstanding of marketing technologies and the third is a lack of accurate metrics and dedicated KPIs.</p><p> <strong>  Lack of communication </strong></p><p> Most CEOs assume public responsibility for the success of their brand &ndash; If the company looks bad, so does the CEO. This responsibility is often accompanied with caution towards brand amplification. As with any business partnership, silos are relaxed with the progression of a working relationship and trust but to begin with, expect senior staff to ask questions and hold activity to caution. This working relationship can be relaxed at speed if the CEO is communicated with to their satisfaction. Each individual will have a unique rate to which they will relax their involvement but it will generally be far quicker if they are informed why you are conducting each activity, how much it is costing the business, what ROI is to be expected and what effect the activity will have on public perception of the brand.</p><p> <strong>  Misunderstanding of marketing technologies </strong></p><p> Ambitious marketers work with new technology on a daily basis.  For those outside of the industry there is little education or understanding of these tools or operations and can lead to a frustration when invoices begin rolling in. Modern marketing tools are incredibly advanced and capability is increasing each day. Most C-level executives will not have much exposure to the latest in digital marketing technology. Some CEOs will have a good understanding of marketing operations and others will be unaware of the industry&rsquo;s progression in the past decade.  <u>  Marketing automation and inbound platforms </u>  are a great place to start when informing a senior management team of marketing capabilities. Most CEOs and CFOs are used to dealing with data and analytics and reporting functionality is a fantastic area to begin. Most senior leaders will welcome the chance to learn how the marketing team are driving their business forward using the latest technology, particularly is they can see evidence in the form of monthly reports.</p><p> <strong>  Lack of evidence </strong></p><p> Accurate metrics are more accessible than ever with the tools available to the modern marketer. Senior management will be looking for evidence that your marketing activity is having a positive effect on company revenue. It is imperative to provide those senior leaders with some form of evidence regarding ROI. If metrics are kept up to date a month in arrears, the CEO will be more likely to place their trust in the marketing team. An overview of marketing activity should be sufficient for this. A basic digital report should comprise of an overview of marketing channel performance, a breakdown of website visits and their sources. The second part of this report should provide opportunities generated from marketing activity and marketing generated sales &ndash; this information can then be updated each month to provide an accurate snapshot of the sales lifecycle.</p><p> It is not necessary for your CEO to be a marketing expert but it is important for them to have an understanding of your marketing activity; why you&rsquo;re doing it and what impact you expect that activity to have on the overall organisation. The three steps above are just the beginning of the journey to challenge the Fournaise Marketing Group&rsquo;s study. People will not invest in what they do not understand or have reason to believe will work. A solid marketing strategy in collaboration with an informed senior management team will ensure greater company investment and improved results. </p>",

The vitamin B your girlfriend takes may keep you up at night.  The fish oil your pilates instructor recommended may make you nauseous.

The proper asset allocation will depend on your financial situation, time horizon for needing to use the funds and your risk tolerance.  Generally, when you're just starting out, your investment horizon is long so your mix will include a greater percentage of riskier investments like stocks, and will slowly change over time to include a larger allocation to more conservative asset types like bonds and/or cash. </p><p> It's important to keep tabs on your asset allocation, as the mix between stocks and bonds will change as some investment values rise and others fall.  Also, be cautious in using general rules of thumb about asset allocation (i.e., use 100 minus your age to determine your bond allocation).  Like the wrong supplements, an improper allocation could cause nausea as well as other financial side effects.  <strong>  We repeat, asset allocation is personal.  </strong></p>",

Have pictures of family</strong> not just certificates of accomplishments front and center and even introduce her to your family even if it&rsquo;s just a picture &ndash; then ask about her family.<strong> 4. Introduce her to all your staff</strong> and say a positive comment about each staff member. Be sure they stand and say her name when responding, make it personal<strong> 5.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  That and other questions will be helpful while addressing your firm&rsquo;s infrastructure, in light of the robo-advisors onset. </strong></p><p> Opinions on robo-advisors range from fear of competition to not impacting an advisor&rsquo;s business. Regardless of where you are on the opinion spectrum, you should take this time to review areas of the robo-advisor&rsquo;s success and compare them to your business model and infrastructure. Don&rsquo;t dismiss their arrival and success as a fad that will disappear in a few years. This is a good time to ponder how their success translates to what your firm can do.</p><p> If you feel the review process is overwhelming, start by using questions about robo-advisors and your firm to determine areas that may necessitate change. Your review may find that many of the successful traits of robo-advisors will not be right for your firm.</p><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Do robo-advisors use Excel?&rdquo; </strong>  If you feel that technology and sophisticated software are part of their success story, then examine why you are still using Excel for applications that should be left to more efficient software. In fact, this is an opportune time to evaluate whether your technology is still the right solution for your business. Think about what robo-advisors are using, or not using, the next time you open up that rebalancing spreadsheet.</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;What can robo-advisors do with their technology that you can&rsquo;t do?&rdquo; </strong>  It&rsquo;s not as much about whether their technology is actually better than yours; they are perceived as having better technology.  Robo-advisors show their clients how great their technology is. They combine data and information to deliver a story in a format pleasing to the client. It&rsquo;s also about how the information looks from a client&rsquo;s perspective and how they look on all devices. What does your technology show your clients?</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Will robo-advisors low fee structure last forever?&rdquo;  </strong> While we know that nothing lasts forever, we don&rsquo;t know what their plan is regarding fees. While advisors are currently faced with fee pressure, robo-advisors may face revenue pressure that will require them to modify their fee structure. Think long-term when considering changes in your fee structure. How will changes impact your current clients and revenue stream? What will clients think if you keep changing your fees?</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Do robo-advisors consider their infrastructure a cost or an investment?&rdquo; </strong>  I find it hard to believe that their business decisions were based on cost alone. Robo-advisors created a business plan and built the infrastructure to support that plan. If I had a dollar for every time an advisor said &ldquo;Wow-that&rsquo;s expensive&hellip;.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Are you trying to compete with robo-advisors or run a business?&rdquo; </strong>  Perhaps robo-advisors are forcing you to consider changes to your business model. But it doesn&rsquo;t end with just the decision to change. What you consider as simplifying may be difficult to implement without disruption. Understand the impact of your decisions on your infrastructure, especially your staff. <br/>  </li><p> When it comes to running your business, there is no such thing as too many questions.</p> ",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Just Google the words &lsquo;employee engagement&rsquo; </strong> and you will find thousands of articles from self-proclaimed experts pontificating on their secrets to success.  Heck, I&rsquo;ve even written some of them.  There are lots of great ideas out there that are worth trying.  As I&rsquo;ve consistently told my readers before,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ruthkross.com/5-elements-create-magic-engagement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employee engagement isn&rsquo;t rocket science  </a> </u> .</p><p> I truly believe that the number one tool to engaging the hearts and minds of your employees is to simply connect one-on-one with them to establish a foundation of trust and respect.  Without that base, it&rsquo;s hard to build a relationship that works long term.</p><p> <strong>  Think about it this way: </strong> if you are building a new building from scratch the first thing that happens is that you pour the foundation.  Once the concrete sets, if you find cracks in that foundation then you need to start over because you need that secure, solid base upon which everything else builds.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no different in the workplace.  If one starts off with a solid foundation between the company, the employee and the manager then engagement can easily occur. But, what happens when that is built on a landfill instead of bedrock? Can you create a lasting, solid relationship?</p><p> No one person alone owns employee engagement. Whether a senior leader, a front-line manager or an individual contributor, each person is responsible. While the tasks for each may be different, the level of accountability is the same.  No matter the title, level or job function there&rsquo;s one core essential needed of everyone involved in order to achieve high engagement. Let&rsquo;s strip this down to the foundation of the house.</p><p> <strong>  The key is to simply connect with one another. </strong> That&rsquo;s it, there&rsquo;s no need for expensive surveys or fancy programs. I&rsquo;m not saying there isn&rsquo;t room for these at some point, but unless you get the foundation right, the rest will simply fall flat.  The best way to engage your employees is to look them in the eye, talk with them (not at them) and listen, both to what was said and also left unsaid. In today&rsquo;s digital society, we have unfortunately lost the fine art of just connecting, of showing respect and treating someone like a human being.</p><p> I once had a boss who started out our relationship early on by showing interest in who I was and what was important to me. He asked questions not only about me, but also wanted to know about the people that mattered to me.  During those days it was easy to be engaged at work because we were usually on the same page. At some point, a number of years later, as the workload tripled and he got comfortable with the fact that he could trust me to get the work done no matter what, our work relationship changed.  Gone were the face-to-face conversations, staff meetings and strategy sessions. In their place was a steady stream of emails.</p><p> Okay, so what&rsquo;s the problem you might ask? Email is a quick, expedient way to communicate, isn&rsquo;t it? Yes, but when the only way you can &lsquo;take the temperature&rsquo; of how your boss is feeling is by noticing his constant use of the cap lock key and counting the exclamation points on the end of his sentences, it&rsquo;s clear the connection is broken.  The lesson here is thatemails, voicemails, text messages and twitter are not the most effective way to connect.  <strong>  No matter how attached we are to our tech devices, there is no substitute for personal conversations. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<strong> I was lucky to have had an early start in the ad agency world.</strong>The energy of youth served me well on those all-nighter pitch preparations (or the fun task of hand cleaning slides&mdash;the Kodak kind&mdash;at midnight). Yes, I was at a distance from strategic work back in those days.It wasn&rsquo;t until I got much closer to the creative development of a project that I really learned about the importance of a well-thought-out and well-written creative brief. And once I moved to the client-side of the table, I truly got a sense of just how critical that document is to the whole creative process. I have never forgotten the words of the CEO at my first corporate (client-side) employer, &ldquo;Great creative comes from a great brief.&rdquo; That statement also gets at the heart of the collaboration between agency and client.So what is a creative brief anyway? Google it, and you&rsquo;ll find that there are many different flavors of a brief out there, but fortunately there are some consistent components that haven&rsquo;t changed all that much over time. I refer to these as the &ldquo;W5+&rdquo;: Why, Who, What, Where, When, and How (the &ldquo;+&rdquo;):<strong> Why:</strong>What is the purpose or objective of the project?<strong> Who:</strong>Who is the target market or audience? What do we know about them? What do we want them to do?<strong> What:</strong>What is the product or service? What are the key messages? What makes the &ldquo;it&rdquo; different or special, or what problem does it solve for the Who?<strong> Where:</strong>Where will the creative be used? What channels and platforms?<strong> When:</strong>When are the deliverables needed? What is the timeline?<strong> How:</strong>What is the voice and tone? How do we want to sound? Are there any assets (visuals, logos, photography etc.) that need to be included? Are there any other details that will guide how we develop the creative execution?If you are client-side, most of the agencies or marketing consultants you&rsquo;ll work with have got their own version of a creative brief. But if you want to get some thinking going before even starting project, the W5+ may be of help.Invest some time and thought in your creative brief, whatever form it takes. The investment in a great brief will help to bring forth great creative.

It's an \"Un-Conference\", a forum where every participant has an opportunity to share and gain in a collaborative, efficient, real time, dynamic and even organized setting.  </p><p> It's the difference between fixed or dynamic meetings or conferences. Traditional conferences are fixed in the respect that you select from pre-defined breakouts or meeting topics and hope that you choose one that is thought provoking and provides opportunity for stimulation. With an \"Un-Conference\" the agenda may be set in terms of high level topics, but the content is largely shaped by participants.</p><p> I have to credit Bob VonderLinn and the other members of the Wisconsin Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) for the initial idea. Bob and his corresponding committee members have successfully utilized this concept for annual conferences and the idea ignited my thinking about sales meetings. Un-Sales Conferences are fun, effective and a little scary the first time out of the gate. Here are some of my insights on what makes this concept work for both conferences and smaller team sales meetings.</p><p> <strong>  Redefine the Experts </strong></p><p> First of all, you have to change your thinking a bit about experts. Most traditional conferences and sales meetings place highest value on \"gurus\" &ndash; those identified as having expertise in a subject or subjects. Experiential learning practitioners subscribe to the concept that subject matter expertise is most gratifying through the combined experiences of participating members. In other words &ndash; every participant has something to share and collectively the group is the expert. </p><p> <strong>  Define High Level Topics if You Must </strong></p><p> There is no right or wrong when it comes to topics. Consider surveying participants to see what's on their mind, what they have interest in learning about and what they have expertise in that they would like to share. What do they want to know about? Once you define initial topics, now ask the team who has expertise in the topics that you have defined.  </p><p> <strong>  My Case Study &ndash; Using the Un-Conference at a National Sales Meeting </strong></p><p> The ability to incorporate \"Un-Conference\" structure largely depends on what your participants already know about the subject matter. I was recently asked to lead a breakout for a national sales conference regarding prospecting and developing new business entitled \"Making Sales Activity Count\". Instead of lecturing to the group of approximately fifty sales professionals, here is how it worked.</p><p> <strong>  Step One - The Set Up </strong></p><p> Sales people were seated in rounds. Each table was equipped with post-it notes, flip chart and information about one of the related topics including:</p><li> Account priorities</li><li> Cold calls</li><li> Pre-call intelligence</li><li> Referrals</li><li> Networking <br/> ​</li><p> <strong>  Step Two &ndash; Quick Overview of each topic and instructions </strong></p><p> Using the handout &ndash; Making Sales Activity Count! (Available for download) we provided a quick overview of the concepts and instructions. Individuals received a \"Sales Bingo\" card to be used as a learning journal to capture ideas shared that they intended to use. Bingo card headers included each of the major topics of discussion. </p><p> <strong>  Step Three &ndash; Group Rounds </strong></p><p> Teams discussed the topic allocated to their table, shared ideas of how they implement the concepts in the field and jotted ideas on both post it notes and in their \"bingo\" journals. Teams migrate to the next table and complete the process until all tables/topics have been visited. Post it notes from each previous group are left on the flip chart by each table for subsequent group review and discussion.</p><p> <strong>  Step Four &ndash; Large Group Debrief </strong></p><p> Winning Bingos were awarded prizes, of course, with one stipulation. The Bingo winners needed to debrief by sharing their takeaways. Bingos and those who were willing to share was not the issue &ndash; finding time to accommodate everyone who wanted to share was!</p><p> Since I am a devote practitioner of experiential learning, employing the \"Un Conference\" concept to my breakout was not too much of a stretch. The room was abuzz and everyone was engaged as teacher, learner and truly active participant.  </p><p> Try Making Sales Activity Count at your next sales meeting or conference.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://ecopreneurist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dave Landry jr  </u> </a></p><p> Small businesses and entrepreneurs are often made up of those striking out on their own to take up a new idea, improve on an existing one, or supply a need for a market. How customers pay for products and services is changing rapidly. Nowadays we don&rsquo;t pay with cash, or even credit cards&mdash;we are starting to roll both into the smartphone. There are two methods to pay for products and services via smartphone: cryptocurrency and mobile payments, so a small business or entrepreneur can and should adopt these payment methods in order to reach all potential markets.</p><p> <strong>  Started From The Bottom </strong></p><p> Cryptocurrency has come a long way since Bitcoin&rsquo;s debut in 2009. As the world&rsquo;s most popular digital currency, Bitcoin has attracted attention (both positive and negative) for its <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   open source nature  </u> </a>  and flexibility. Users can transfer bitcoins between each other without the intervention of a bank or central monetary authority. Although this may be risky for small businesses and entrepreneurs due to a lack of regulation, a growing number of businesses and entrepreneurs were willing to adopt bitcoins as a form of payment during Bitcoin Black Friday in 2013.</p><p> Bitcoins are most popular in Latin America, where banking and monetary systems are  <u>  prone to failure </u> . This gives bitcoins the fluidity to survive in an uncertain monetary environment. However, the rest of the world has yet to catch on&mdash;although there are 13 million bitcoins in circulation, 64% of bitcoins still sit in inactive accounts. This is a risk that small businesses and entrepreneurs should be willing to take because the bitcoin market is still widely untapped.</p><p> <strong>  There&rsquo;s An App For That </strong></p><p> Mobile payment is another way to pay for products and services on the go. For ease of use, your small business should have an app&mdash;if you have IT expertise, you can easily create one, or contract a third party to do so on your behalf. You can also make use of an online store in conjunction with <a href=\"http://ecopreneurist.com/2014/03/25/productivity-apps-eco-social-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   these productivity apps  </u> </a>  so that you can keep costs low as you expand your business. If you already have a website, make sure it is mobile-friendly and/or can scale down to mobile devices so you can make conversions more easily.</p><p> For a small business, you want to keep your overhead as low as possible as you continue to market your products and services on the Internet via social media and other digital avenues. You also should make the three  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.depositaccounts.com/blog/2011/05/google-wallet-to-replace-credit-cards-coupons-loyalty-cards-gift-cards.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   major mobile payment options available  </a> </u> &mdash;Google Wallet, Apple Pay and Amazon Payments. If you issue coupons or loyalty cards, you also want to transfer them to be redeemable there as well.</p><p> One of the major markets for mobile payments is one you should consider expanding to in the near future. Africa not only has the highest usage of mobile payments&mdash;it is also <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/168797/africa-continues-going-mobile.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   the fastest-growing smartphone market  </u> </a>  in the world, outpacing Asia and North America in growth. One of the major markets on the African continent, Kenya, has had success with its <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/05/economist-explains-18\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   M-PESA mobile payments app  </u> </a>  in partnership with their largest mobile provider, Safari Telecom. This has encouraged entrepreneurship in the country on a wide scale due to the impracticality of going to a brick and mortar financial institution, and has helped improve the lives of Kenyan citizens. Other African countries are looking to imitate Kenya&rsquo;s success, and M-PESA is looking to expand into other African markets and into Asian markets that have large rural populations that cannot easily access a physical bank location.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s Next? </strong></p><p> Like all things, both have pros and cons&mdash;cryptocurrency lacks a regulatory authority, but it is fluid in markets with unstable financial systems and is beginning to be accepted as an alternative form of payment. Mobile payments have had security issues in the past, but are generally more trustworthy than cryptocurrencies and have established themselves in many major markets around the world. A small business or entrepreneur should consider both options as they offer new products and services and/or expand their business into new markets, especially emerging markets such as Latin America and Africa, where <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/africas-middle-class-triples-to-more-than-310m-over-past-30-years-due-to-economic-growth-and-rising-job-culture-reports-afdb-7986/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   the middle class has tripled  </u> </a>  between 1981 and 2011. Combined with the right marketing techniques, any small business or entrepreneur can benefit greatly by offering these avenues as payment options.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1_6.png\" width=\"624\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1035\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2_7.png\" width=\"627\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3_4.png\" width=\"625\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1008\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4_3.png\" width=\"625\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"884\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5_3.png\" width=\"627\"/></p>",

    "content": "<p> Last October,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/28/venture-funding-wealthfront-idUSL1N0SN27E20141028\" target=\"_blank\">   Wealthfront raised  </a> </u>  $64M at a valuation of $700M.  Were Wealthfront a brick-and-mortar adviser, it might command a typical valuation multiple of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/blogs/business-valuation-methods-for-financial-advisors-2687636-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2-3X revenue  </a> </u> .  Since Wealthfront  <a href=\"http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/iapd/content/viewform/adv/Sections/iapd_AdvAdvisoryBusinessSection.aspx?ORG_PK=148456&amp;RGLTR_PK=50000&amp;STATE_CD=&amp;FLNG_PK=04CDCB5800080177053724E0051F8189056C8CC0\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   manages about $1.7B  </u>    </a> at last public count, on which it  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.wealthfront.com/faq\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   charges  </a> </u>  up to .25%, it should have revenues of around $4M.  That makes it worth, say, $10M?  OK, let&rsquo;s say $20M, or even $50M!  But $700M?</p><p> Wealthfront is a robo-adviser, and robots are different, or so we hear.  These online platforms,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-snap-up-online-financial-advisers-1423763622\" target=\"_blank\">   which raised almost $300M  </a> </u>  in 2014 alone, offer automated, algorithmic, model-based portfolio allocation, trade execution, and rebalancing for individual accounts.  Robo-advisers (of which Betterment, FutureAdvisor, and Motif Investing are among the other  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2015/02/05/7-robo-advisors-that-make-investing-effortless/\" target=\"_blank\">   big names  </a> </u> ) have much smaller or zero minimum balances, and charge much lower fees (in the range of .10-.40%), than traditional independent advisers.  They promise to offer clean, intuitive interfaces to help everyday investors save and invest in a risk-appropriate and even tax-sensitive way, at a fraction of the cost of a traditional alternative.  They arguably increase investor access to discretionary wealth management, and work to expand consumer choice.  And by pressuring the competition to up their game on service, fees, and risk-adjusted performance, robo-advising might add real value across the asset size and investor sophistication spectra.</p><p> So is it flawed and anachronistic to even suggest a valuation comparison between a hot robo-adviser and its dinosaur counterpart?  Clearly, any  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/blogs/business-valuation-methods-for-financial-advisors-2687636-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   proper assessment  </a> </u>  of an investment advisory practice would incorporate not just current asset size, but current and future rates of asset growth, client retention and loyalty, net margin per client and trends in these margins, and differentiation by service, fees, investment approach, and client type, among other factors.  But for robo-advisers, even a shallow dive into these factors raises more questions than it answers.  The 70X valuation gap is clearly simplistic, but should give serious pause to those bullish on robo-advising as a standalone business model, especially at such valuations. </p><p> Yes, the major robo-advisers have been growing at double or even triple digits recently, but this is from a relatively miniscule base.  Four of the largest robo-advisers  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-snap-up-online-financial-advisers-1423763622\" target=\"_blank\">   manage  </a> </u>  less than $10B combined, out of a pool of $17T managed by all US advisers.  Yes, their fees are low &ndash; often a third or a quarter of traditional advisers.  And yes, they have small or zero minimum account levels, in theory offering discretionary wealth management services to a much broader population.  But that&rsquo;s as far as the cuckoo flies.  Robo-advisers do not typically provide broader financial planning or auxiliary services like tax planning, estate planning, or insurance products.  Crucially, when asset levels rise and/or investors age, these services  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150219/FREE/150219908/wealthy-investors-choose-traditional-advisers-over-robo-advisers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   become increasingly central  </a> </u>  to the adviser-client relationship.  And they are silent on the very life events and human concerns that build client loyalty or precipitate the search for an adviser in the first place, such as marriage, divorce, retirement, kids to college, parents to long term care, or estate and legacy issues. </p><p> Most importantly, and most obviously, a robo-relationship lacks the human element.  And this human absence is not just a question of &lsquo;millennial preference for online advice&rsquo;; the issue is much more fundamental.  Most investors hire advisers to invest their assets &ndash; more precisely, to take investment risk &ndash; that they are too afraid, too busy, or too inexperienced, to take themselves.  In other words, when an investor hires an adviser, they are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18174\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   buying not alpha, but beta  </a> </u> ; mediated by the adviser-investor relationship of trust and access, they are buying risk-adjusted exposure to the market itself.  So this human mediation is not just a &lsquo;perk&rsquo; or &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; that wealthier investors can afford; it is arguably the core value delivered by traditional advisers.  For example, speaking to a human one personally knows and trusts may prevent investors from doing stupid things in scary times, like liquidating their stock portfolios at market troughs (keeping investors invested during gut-wrenching downturns is the very hallmark of a good adviser).  Taking gains off the table in frothier times, moving assets in and out of tax-advantaged vehicles based on changing tax brackets and rates, or even disciplining clients into sticking to their savings plan in &lsquo;inconvenient&rsquo; times, are less dramatic but equally vital examples of the ongoing value of a trusted human adviser.   </p><p> If you&rsquo;re still convinced that robo-advice isn&rsquo;t just a business tool (albeit a powerful one in the right circumstances), but a game-changing business proposition, note how the industry has reacted to its emergence.  On the one hand, sophisticated independent advisers are already  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/03/02/keeping-up-with-the-robo-race\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   launching proprietary  </a> </u>  or white-label robo-solutions to complement their traditional offerings.  These might work either as &lsquo;starter&rsquo; or  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110514/how-financial-advisors-can-adjust-roboadvisors.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &lsquo;feeder&rsquo; programs  </u>    </a> for younger investors who would later graduate to a comprehensive relationship, or as part of a &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; offering where online interaction complements and supplements in-person meetings.  On the other hand, industry behemoths are taking the cue.   <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/news/ria/schwab-unveils-robo-advisor-no-fees-for-investors-rias-2690885-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Schwab is launching  </u>    </a> an advisory platform, both directly to consumers and as a white-label offering to independent advisers, for free.  <a href=\"http://www.riabiz.com/a/4953212540944384/fidelity-and-betterment-sign-a-deal-steve-lockshin-and-marty-bicknell-as-groomsmen-at-the-altar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Fidelity has partnered  </u> </a>  with Betterment to offer an institutional version of Betterment&rsquo;s platform to Fidelity&rsquo;s adviser network.

How can they compete with institutional brokerages and fund companies on fees, distribution, and branding; or with traditional independent advisers on bespoke, personalized, and comprehensive service?         </p><p> Robo-advice may be a valuable business tool, but is not a viable business model.  </p>",

    "content": "<p> The other day I got a connection request from LinkedIn. The person's profile was very scarce, because the young lady had just started out in sales and the reason I accepted her request was simple. I am on a mission to elevate the reputation of sales and its practitioners, so <strong>  what better opportunity than being connected with a person who is starting this difficult career </strong> .</p><p> A couple of days after I connected with her she sent me a request through LinkedIn offering her service (what else is new?). The email contained the following phrase:</p><p> My guess is before you retire you&rsquo;ll probably change jobs&hellip;which means you&rsquo;ll go a &ldquo;recruiting process&rdquo; about 100 times. It&rsquo;s like professional frog kissing&hellip; and there&rsquo;s always one slimy one.</p><p> <strong>  Always be relevant </strong></p><p> Aside from the fact that the email missed a word (through), the proposition was fairly attractive. Very politely I wrote back (because I believe in business courtesy) that I was not interested, because of my background (which she should have researched before sending the email).\" I am not a sales person, but a business owner, so the offer is not relevant to me\" was my response.</p><p> At that point, the only appropriate answer to me should have been a nice \"thank you for clarifying\".</p><p> BUT, there was another email that landed in my inbox just the next day, stating the following:</p><p> I understand! Thanks so much for your response, in fact \"\"thank you but I'm not interested\"\" is our most common response. When you have 90 seconds, check this video.</p><p> It's not that I am not interested, <strong>  I am not your target audience! </strong></p><p> At that point I decided to write this blog, because there is a pattern here and readers of my articles know that I usually pick topics that showcase common mistakes or misunderstandings.</p><p> Being not interested is quite different from not being qualified.</p><p> So, what are the differences?</p><p> Sometimes, service offerings are very compelling, really suited for my business needs but I might not be interested because of budget restraints, not having enough time to look at the offering, or any other valid reason that keeps me from pursuing the offer.</p><p> It ain't me babe!</p><p> Not being qualified for a service offering means that the person who approaches you didn't do their research. They don't know enough about you and/or your company, or you are not the decision maker for the product/service offering.</p><p> <strong>  If you don't do your research as a sales person, you might end up targeting people who are not qualified to begin with. </strong> This young lady was obviously trained to search out contacts on LinkedIn, using the keyword \"sales\" and not qualifying them any further, or she doesn't really understand the service that she is selling. Both possibilities are common and this example although quite perfect when it comes to how NOT to identify qualified buyers for your offering is not that rare. This person was very young and inexperienced, so I wrote her back explaining the difference between not interested and not qualified (my way of paying forward), but it's a lesson for all sales people. Veterans and beginners alike. Research, research, research.</p><p> Develop a prospect avatar so you understand who is qualified for your service offering and determine who is not. This will not only help you prospect more effectively, it will also keep you from being a time waster to the people you target.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> In our constant pursuit of technological discoveries are we in danger of losing our ability to just be?</h3><p> <br/> We are, as a race, always looking ahead to the future. Constantly moving forwards into new realms of technology, science, medicine, our world and the universe.</p><p> We drip feed ourselves daily with bite size helpings of information that we bank subconsciously and consciously in our ever busying minds. Our brains must be bursting at the seams with the amount of information held. Those little neurons sure are working hard to compartmentalize everything and ensure each part of our brain processes the right information correctly, let alone allowing ourselves to function on a day to day basis like remembering to go to work and where we put the car keys.</p><p> Are we losing the ability to just be? Do we have to constantly satisfy our need to be in the know? Do we really have to know what so and so is up to, know what going on the news, politics, media, anything and everything? Are we frowned upon if we don&rsquo;t &lsquo;keep up&rsquo;?  Well, it was all over Twitter, how come you didn&rsquo;t see it?  Do we feel embarrassed if we don&rsquo;t know? Keep up at the back of the class! Are you listening? Stop day dreaming! Stop looking out the window and the sky and the trees and the sun! Absorb this information! You need to know this!</p><p> But do we really? I&rsquo;m not saying we mustn&rsquo;t learn, quite the opposite. I aspire to learn something new every day, but I try to sift through the information and retain the stuff I want to retain. Saying that, subconsciously, of course I&rsquo;m going to retain everything anyway, the brain is amazing like that. It all gets retained and filed away whether you like it or not. The clever part is trying to find it again. Like an expert PA the information gets efficiently filed in just the right place. Brilliant, but when he&rsquo;s off work you&rsquo;re stuffed!</p><p> Maybe we have to be more strict with ourselves with what we absorb. Every day I come across people who say &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got so much on my mind&rsquo; or &lsquo;I just can&rsquo;t think straight.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not surprising. Not only do we have to deal with our own personal issues and day to day stuff we absorb every piece of other information that comes our way like sponges. A lot of this information is also sadly very distressing: wars, famine, human suffering, terrorism, global disasters&hellip; How can we possibly be expected to take the burden of all this suffering? And not only that but we can&rsquo;t do anything about it. Well, unless you&rsquo;re God of course. Because he&rsquo;s in charge right? Which brings us neatly to spirituality. Do we have a spiritual side? Is modern life and our pursuit of dehumanizing technologies like artificial intelligence, robots and telepresence in danger of diminishing our ability to be a spiritual human?</p><p> Some could argue that we are void of a spiritual side, that all we are just a miraculous bunch of molecules making up a human body. In which case the potential dehumanising of us doesn&rsquo;t really matter. We are simply a biological being and our &lsquo;spiritual side&rsquo; was and is just a figment of our imagination. Maybe all these clever neurons along with a large cocktail of neurotransmitters concocted this idea of a &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; to make us feel more &lsquo;human.&rsquo;</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s just neural trickery? Well, I, for one, will take a huge slug of that concoction because I think that without the feeling of spirituality or individualism or &lsquo;self&rsquo; we are just another biological being and that&rsquo;s pretty damn soul destroying.</p><p> So, if we are so human and full of spirituality how do we expect to impart this into creating copies of ourselves with artificial intelligence? How can we make an &lsquo;artificial human&rsquo; when we&rsquo;re not entirely sure what we are made up of ourselves? Do we need a soul or a spiritual side?</p><p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.futuristmm.com/future-love/were-virtually-there/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   We&rsquo;re Virtually There  </a> </u> , I spoke about the cyberships and virtual relationships and the question of whether, if we do create artificial intelligences that are as close to a human as we can, would be have the potential to fall in love with one? Are we forgetting how to be truly human or are we happily evolving into a cyber-human race where the lines become blurred between human and robot? Are we heading for a world filled with robots and artificial intelligence, a multi-cyber as well as a multi-cultural world? It all sounds a bit extreme, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> I think at the moment there&rsquo;s a big backlog of technology. Like the Hoover Dam, it&rsquo;s holding back a huge wave of technology just waiting to be released.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.futuristmm.com/?p=8013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   See Digital Technology &ndash; What Now?  </a> </u></p><p> I think the increased use of artificial intelligence in the corporate world is inevitable, and this in no doubt spill rapidly into our commercial world. The question is how will our integration with AI&rsquo;s develop and how will this effect humanity?</p>",

I still struggle with that boundary from time to time.  It is hard to know exactly where training stops and development begins because sometimes the line is pretty thin.</p><p> <strong>  Training is about showing someone how to do something they don&rsquo;t already know how to do. Refreshers and retraining can wander into the grey area where training and development overlap. </strong> However, what keeps those in the training zone is lack of proficiency or consistency in performance.  Where there is no proficiency or consistency in performance, there is no real development.  All the focus is on getting performance to standard, not on growth.

    "link": "can-a-budget-turn-dreams-into-reality",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re like many you hate the idea of a budget. </strong> I&rsquo;ve heard many people find it to be constraining. However are you on track to reaching your long-term goals? Do you find yourself making resolutions that never seem to materialize? Then a budget may just be the right thing.</p><p> <strong>  My budget lesson </strong></p><p> A few years ago I found myself asking the question (where did my money go?) At the time I had a two latte a day Starbucks habit. I decided to take them up on the idea of getting a Starbucks prepaid card. While I paid for this card with my credit card I knew that it would help me to think about how often I was refilling that card. If you&rsquo;re like me you don&rsquo;t go through the details of your credit card statement. If it seems to fit within your normal range, you just would pay the bill. I began to find out that I was refilling this prepaid card more often than I realized. I asked myself &ldquo;why did I enjoy going to Starbucks?&rdquo; I found it was more for camaraderie and experience than it was for the coffee. I discovered three ways I could address that need:</p><li> The first was cut out Starbucks altogether</li><li> Switch to once a day</li><li> Start getting a coffee instead of a latte <br/>  </li><p> I opted for switching to coffee and going from a Grande a size to a Tall (small). Now that I am married with kids, most of my coffee is made at home.</p><p> <strong>  What are you spending on? </strong></p><p> Do you know where your money is going? Getting control of your spending involves understanding what you&rsquo;re spending your money on. Like me you may find that there are certain items that are more about lifestyle and relationships than they are about function. A budget can help you lay those things out and to prioritize them in your life. Is your coffee habit more important than funding your children&rsquo;s education? Do you deserve the daily coffee run over the more expensive car and its monthly payment? These are but a couple of prioritization issues that I have encountered in counseling my clients. With goals that require savings and the compounding of investment returns for them to grow the longer these things go unfunded or underfunded will require more drastic cuts to spending. Oftentimes cuts in future spending won&rsquo;t even get you far enough and then will require you compromise on the goal itself such as a second home or retiring at a later date. My experience is that most people would rather not delay their retirement. In fact, many people would like to accelerate their retirement. A budget today can help you avert these compromises.</p><p> <strong>  What should you do? </strong></p><p> Do you feel that you fully understanding this aspect of finance or you have never been taught and need help? If you feel you know what to do but aren&rsquo;t doing it, I recommend an accountability partner. Many people find an accountability partner helps them be accountable to do things they already know how to do. Oftentimes birds of a feather flock together. In that case your friends have behavior similar to yours it would not be the best accountability partner for sticking to a budget.</p><p> If you have never been taught, you likely need to work with a credentialed financial planner, such as a Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor or CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; professional. They should be able educate you on budgeting and other elements of your financial foundation.</p><p> No matter what camp you are in, there are online tools that might be helpful. I provide my financial planning clients a personal website that can assist them in their budgeting. I also provide them with ongoing financial and behavioral counseling, to help them tie their budget to their goals. A few have told me that this accountability and the review meetings that we have are what they find even more valuable than the website itself.</p><p> No matter if you decide to learn more about how we can help, we implore you to start budgeting now and to find a personal trainer-like accountability partner today. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the website you can go  <u>  <a href=\"http://envisionwealth.us/financial-organizer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://envisionwealth.us/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contact us  </a> </u> .</p><p> The opinions voiced in this material are for general information only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual.</p>",

Indeed, based on the author&rsquo;s experience, the likelihood of an innovation being truly new is directly proportional to the amount of research and discovery that was undertaken; that is, only through diligent efforts of research and discovery can an inventor arrive at high certainty that the innovation will result in a useful invention.<br/> No matter the degree of certainty maintained by an inventor, the processes of research and discovery need to be executed faithfully to develop the evidence and proof of uniqueness and usefulness to third parties (e.g., founders and investors). <strong> MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS TO A PROBLEM ARE HIGHLY PROBABLE IF NOT CERTAIN</strong> It may be that a vision can be sustained by more than one possible solution, so in thinking forward to creating a business with high sustainability and value, it behooves the inventor/entrepreneur to secure any viable solution so that the eventual new venture has the maximum opportunities within the marketplace.<p> Thus, finding all potential solutions requires research into what already exists in the form of existing patents that may be acquired or licensed and also defines the &ldquo;territory&rdquo;[1] that is protected by that patent. That information is needed so that organic development activities can take place in territory that is not protected by the inventions and patents of others. Thus, solutions may be either acquired or developed organically. An organic solution is derived solely or mostly from the independent work of the inventor or inventors.</p><p> Acquiring a patent from another party may be impossible if that patent is owned by a company that is in the business of developing products that depend on that patent. In cases involving university or government research, securing a license is possible if one has not already been acquired under an exclusive license with another party. Or, even if it&rsquo;s available and licensable, the licensee expectations for remuneration may be judged to be too great. However, many licensees are flexible, so if the patent is important enough to the expected new venture, it may be momentarily secured or fixed through a short-term agreement with the licensee to not license to another party in return for a nonreimbursable retainer/fee.</p><p> The permutations possible for securing available patents are numerous, and the entrepreneur needs to be prepared to both find available patents, whether interfering or supportive, and cope with licensor requirements. The important point to remember is that other potential solutions need to be researched and understood for their impact on the entrepreneur&rsquo;s plans and the inventor&rsquo;s perception of the innovativeness of his/her idea and target invention. It is also good to remember that at a future point in time, investors will be conducting due diligence and asking questions about potential competing technology.</p><p> <strong>  ORGANIC INVENTION AND INNOVATION </strong></p><p> The more likely situation for most entrepreneurs and inventors is that they have an innovative idea in mind based on their knowledge and experiences within a specific area. They may be technology experts in the area and already have sound reasons for believing an invention may be at hand. The patent research discussed above in the context of potential acquisition is an essential first step in discovery even if there is no intention to acquire a patent from another party.</p><p> The principal objective in this initial research-and-discovery period is to determine that another party has not already accomplished the innovation. Part of this research is in relation to technology and patents as discussed above. The other part of research involves the exploration of public disclosures made by others that could be found in publications (trade magazines, magazines, journal articles, etc.), the websites of expected competitors, and blogs and sites found on the Internet.</p><p> Between the problem and opportunity discovery and the efforts described herein, a good and ideally excellent understanding of where innovation potential lies should be at hand. Often, and especially when more than one inventor or entrepreneur may be involved, it is useful to brainstorm about the problems, environment, existing solutions, and probable solutions. The purpose is to broaden thinking, explore potential solutions, and begin to define the fundamental elements of one or more innovations in anticipation of the coming efforts to define an invention. It would not be unusual to see an idea and innovation become modified in important ways to make sure that an invention is more likely to result in a granted patent.</p><p> <strong>  SUMMARY </strong></p><p> During the early period of time when ideation, invention, and innovation are fervently being considered by an entrepreneurial team it is vital to comprehensively conduct research and discovery to ensure that ensuing patents, whether organic or acquired, are more likely to be robust and valuable. Value of course accrues from the ability of the patent to provide one or barriers of entry to potential competitors.</p><p> Footnotes</p><p> [1] Territory, in the context of the present discussion, refers to the ideas, thoughts, applications, etc., as delineated by the claims of a patent, primarily, but also as may be revealed in any other parts of the patent. The territory defines those areas that are, in essence, off limits to the inventor.</p> ",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Mike Glover </u></p><p> &ldquo;Some may think one of the strangest things to do is believe in a stranger, but if not one stranger believed in us, once upon a time, where would we all be today?&hellip; someone did it for you.&rdquo;  &ndash; Anne Kreamer</p><p> Kind of makes you think, right? This statement is borrowed from a great  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/02/make_a_stranger_believe_in_y.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog  </a> </u>  called Make a Stranger Believe in You. At first, I thought it sounded ridiculous but I did want to read more. After finishing the article, I realized that trusting strangers, especially at work, is something we should do every day.</p><p> Unless you work at a very small organization, there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;ll ever know all of the staff. Often we have to make decisions based on information received from far off departments and faceless individuals. Each time this occurs, we make an implicit judgment to believe in that stranger and their work. It&rsquo;s these implicit judgments that allow companies to excel.</p><p> Now I&rsquo;m not saying that you should blindly believe everything that comes across your desk, but with a healthy resolve, I believe we owe it to ourselves, and the success of our organization, to trust the strangers within our organization.</p><p> Interaction Associates (2012) conducted a study about the value of trust, leadership and collaboration within an organization. This study found that companies considered &ldquo;high performers&rdquo; had P/E ratios 28.5% higher than average/low performers.</p><p> According to Interaction Associates, high performing organizations:</p><li> Trust their employees and acknowledge them for the work they do. They create a shared sense of commitment and responsibility and allow open channels for ideas and opinions to flow between colleagues within the organization.</li><li> Have leaders that effectively communicate strategic direction. They make sound decisions even when the situation is ambiguous and they provide focused, balanced and timely feedback to teams and individuals.</li><li> Ensure that employees are aware of decisions and appropriately involved. They&rsquo;re willing to share information and have the interpersonal and group skills needed to collaborate. <br/>  </li><p> Of course these are attributes that every organization strives for, but in order for them to occur, they require one binding factor: all employees believe in the company and feel they are working towards the same collective purpose &ndash; whether they know one another or not. </p><p> To achieve this trust in strangers you need to:</p><li> Be genuine and authentic. Share ideas, criticisms and goals with colleagues, peers, and leaders that you may not know.</li><li> Recognize and embrace personal vulnerability and ask for help from others even if you&rsquo;ve never worked with them before.</li><li> Recognize and believe that strangers with a common goal can accomplish more together than apart. <br/>  </li><p> So the next time you&rsquo;re pondering why your organization is struggling to reach the &ldquo;high performing&rdquo; zone, consider whether you truly believe the strangers in your own organization.  Are you authentic with them even if they may not think the same way you do? Do you ask for help when you need it from others you don&rsquo;t know? Do you feel that you and that guy in HR are both trying to make the organization a better place to work?</p><p> Great teams and great organizations are built on a common belief in purpose and people. So the next time you get a call from somebody in finance you don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t let it go to voicemail. Pick up the phone and believe in that stranger.</p>",

    "title": "How Reserve Wines Contribute To The Art Of Champagne Making",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.bkwine.com/news/champagne-from-small-independent-producers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sara Underdown  </u> </a></p><p> The true art of champagne making lies in its blending; largely because of the difficulty associated with producing a good and balanced wine from a single location and grape variety. Climate irregularities (producing poor vintages), house style and volume needed to meet sales demand requires wine to be blended from different locations, grape varieties and vintages. <br/> <br/> Reserve wines are a necessary and integral part of blending non-vintage champagne every year. They are produced by becoming base wines &ndash; undergoing the first fermentation &ndash; and then stored (in a tank, bottle or barrel) and used to blend the champagne at a later stage. The act of blending reduces vintage variations (ensuring consistency) and adds complexity in the production of non-vintage champagne.  <br/> <br/> Importantly, this ensures that champagne producers are able to achieve their house style year after year as well as making young champagne drinkable; imparting depth, roundness, toastiness, oak characters (if stored in barrels) and complexity as well as restraining the very high levels of acidity naturally present in the wine. <br/> <br/> Having a large collection of reserve wines is imperative for the Chef de Cave (chief winemaker) to successfully blend a wine to overcome vintage variations and achieve house style. Therefore, wine must be developed from many different locations right across the Champagne region. Champagne Houses use their large buying capacity and network of growers to gain the very best access to grapes in order to produce a large library of wines that can be stored as reserve wines. By way of example, Bollinger&rsquo;s Special Cuvee uses 120 different parcels of land across 30 crus from the Vallee de la Marne; around 80 per cent of which are of Grand Cru and Premier Cru quality. It is generally considered that the more wine that is blended together from different and geographically diverse parcels of land, the more complex and better quality the resulting champagne will be. <br/> <br/> The amount of reserve wine used in each blend is at the discretion of the Chef de Cave and varies (typically between 10 and 50 per cent) according to vintage conditions and the requirements of house style. Some Champagne Houses, like Louis Roederer for example, are known for using generous amounts of reserve wines (up to 12 per cent) to create their signature toasty, rich and complex non-vintage champagne. At their premises in Reims, they have 150 oak barrels used exclusively for reserve wines. Kept in their year of vintage, there is enough wine for 1.3 million bottles &ndash; the largest collection of reserve wine in Champagne. Of course, this large collection of reserve wine could not be possible without excellent access to the precious grapes that afford such a bountiful supply. Louis Roederer is the largest owner of vineyards in Champagne; guaranteeing them 75 per cent of their required production levels each year. Having access to the best grapes in significant quantities year after year has enabled Roederer to develop excellent reserve wines that have consistently produced very high quality non-vintage champagne year after year (irrespective of vintage conditions), and a strong and identifiable character. The greater the percentage of reserve wine added to the final blend of champagne, the better quality and complex it will be. <br/> <br/> Lastly, the more the reserve wines used in a blend, the less dosage is required to smooth out vintage variations. By way of example, the very hot 2003 vintage produced many inconsistencies in grape quality across Champagne. Champagne Houses that used a high proportion of reserve wines were able to successfully smooth out these inconsistencies and produce drinkable, quality champagne that is quite dry on the palate. <br/> <br/> So it would seem that using increasingly higher amounts of reserve wine not only improves the overall quality of champagne, it is also a key point of difference that separates champagne from other sparkling wines around the world.</p>",
