Four years later, his father invested the families&#39; entire life savings in one &quot;sure thing&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And sure enough, it went bankrupt. The family lost everything. Since then, Adam has looked back with appreciation for the investing lessons his father gave him, and maybe that one most of all: even the smartest people can make catastrophic mistakes handling their finances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of this experience, Adam developed a fascination for classic investment bubbles: The Tulip Mania of 17th Holland, and The South Sea Bubble in 18th England, both of which ensnared and devastated their respective nations for generations. These lessons remain starkly relevant in the modern economy. Drawn to investment theory, risk management, and investing behavior, Adam studied Economics at Bristol University, the think-tank for Margaret Thatcher&#39;s Economic Policy, and the UK leader in the burgeoning field of Monetarist Economic Theory.

Critics argue that this is a weakness. Fiat, however, sees this as an example of the importance of trust, and even faith, for economic relationships to exist. When a parent gives a child a dollar for school, it is a vote of confidence and faith. When an individual invests a dollar, they do so because they have faith that the underlying business will succeed. Without some amount of faith in each other, economic relationships both on a large and small scale cannot exist. Trust is the bedrock of the work at Fiat Wealth Management.

A unique series of events led him to negotiation for individuals and to the team at Vestia. Greg&rsquo;s brother, an orthopedic surgeon, asked him to look over an employment contract as a second opinion. Greg read the contract and gave many recommendations to make the contract better for his brother, both financially and for his quality of life. He took it a step further to actually sketch out the negotiation process and how to prioritize the various &ldquo;asks.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s brother was impressed with the process and results, as were others that reviewed the final outcome, and they began referring colleagues. Referrals from those colleagues followed, and Greg soon had a thriving negotiation consulting business.

    "bio": "<p>A goal is just an idea, bringing it to life requires a plan, buy-in and the ability to deliver.&nbsp; Wired for growth, I&#39;ve spent the last 15 years in the financial services industry always focused on building and expanding businesses and people. The first half of my career was on the advisor-side, at an RIA firm and the second half was at a fast-growing alternatives asset manager. I&#39;ve done it all (maybe not all but a lot), I&#39;ve worn many marketing and sales hats, developed people and teams (including a marketing, internal sales and sales strategy and analytics team), helped build and merge businesses, implemented (a lot of) new ideas, worked with operational teams, data-focused specialists, developers, technologists, the most junior and the most senior leaders. My professional experience, full of zigs and zags has provided me with an unbelievable real-life education on how to think strategically, tactically and analytically and partner with people from across an organization to deliver big and lasting results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth is, I never set out to be in financial services. I wanted to impact people, improve their lives and influence positive change. I quickly learned at the RIA firm that advisors and financial professionals deeply impact peoples&#39; lives everyday. Confidence, freedom, security, the ability to pursue big dreams are largely dependent on financial success and well being. Empowering financial professionals to succeed and grow, and ultimately help their clients thrive is my why. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love helping businesses and individuals grow in scalable and sustainable ways. When I&#39;m not working with clients you&#39;ll likely find me staying active with my husband (my high-school sweetheart who also happens to be an advisor) and our two girls, on a yoga mat or seeking new opportunities to learn and grow (surfing is next on the list!) daily.

He&rsquo;s a combat veteran and served as an officer in the United States Marines Corps on both active duty and in the reserves, retiring at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. While serving on active duty, Dave was unable to spend money on deployments, so he became a self-taught investor. Along with a few bucks cash as a bouncer, his investing performance grew to be good enough to pay for an MBA, a new car and two years of living expenses. He was proud of that, so after returning home for an MBA at his alma mater, the University of South Carolina, Dave became a CFA Charterholder (because, he says, &ldquo;What could possibly be more fun than spending an additional three years earning the CFA Charter? Turns out, a lot of things,&rdquo; but he&rsquo;s glad he got it.) and worked for large Wall Street firms. The reason Dave <a href=\"https://monumentwealthmanagement.com/about-monument-wealth-management/\">co-founded Monument</a> is because it became abundantly clear to him that the financial services industry was drowning in a sea of sameness. Real wealth planning either didn&rsquo;t exist or was nothing more than a mechanism to generate an asset allocation and sell products. Creativity was nonexistent, culture was focused on shareholder profits, and advisors were accountable to sales managers, not their clients. He was unimpressed&mdash;and very, very bored. So, in May of 2008, Dave co-founded Monument Wealth Management, experiencing a very real-life example of the difficulty in market timing. Dave can name a number of reasons why someone would want to hire Monument, but he says what really stands out about us is that our razor-sharp Team has a renegade spirit and a passion for what we do&ndash;-and it shows every single day.
