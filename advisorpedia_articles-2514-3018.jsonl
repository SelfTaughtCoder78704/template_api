What you will rarely see being discussed are topics involving project failure.</p><p> In order to ensure the success of a project you&rsquo;re assigned to handle, you should also be aware of the common reasons why projects fail. This way, you will know what to avoid, and what you can do in case any of these issues begin to affect you and your team.</p><h3> Below are some of them that you should know:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  #1 &ndash; Unclear or Unidentified Scope </strong></p><p> The scope of a project includes not only the things that should be done, but also the things that shouldn&rsquo;t be done. As a project manager, once the project work is identified, you have to be sure there are no unplanned changes to it. You should be able to anticipate also what possible changes will be required, so that you may be prepared to set a new schedule or budget perhaps. Otherwise, it is very likely that you will miss your target, which will become a disappointment to the management and the customers.</p><p> <strong>  #2 &ndash; Wrong Allocation of Resources </strong></p><p> Project managers need to do a better job of knowing what their people are doing, and what resources are being used for a particular project. Project failure happens when people or team members do not have a clear understanding of what projects they need to focus on and when. Thus, managers are advised to meet frequently so they may discuss how resources are allocated and being utilized.</p><p> <strong>  #3 &ndash; Lack of Proper Communications </strong></p><p> It is typical of some team members to know the project manager only through various means of communications. In many cases, workers are only given instructions over the phone or through emails. This is inevitable because some projects are so huge and involve way too many people. Thus, project managers must be effective communicators to avoid confusion and chaos.</p><p> <strong>  #4 &ndash; Wrong Estimates </strong></p><p> Estimates should not be guessed. Calculating duration of time as well as the amount of money needed for the completion of a project should be based on historical records. Doing guesses instead often leads to erroneous scheduling, and increased risk.</p><p> <strong>  #5 &ndash; Lack of Risk Management </strong></p><p> Every project is different and so uncertainty is always part of the picture. This uncertainty is also known as risk, especially when the uncertainty is quantified. Project managers need to be able to anticipate what things could go wrong, and what challenges may come their way. This way, the team will be able to come up with strategies on how to respond to such risks in case they occur.</p><p> Good and effective  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   project management requires a lot of focus and commitment  </a> </u> , especially on the part of a project manager or leader. If you have been assigned to manage a certain project, you have to make every effort to communicate with your people well to make sure resources are allocated properly, risk is calculated and prepared for, and project scope is perfectly understood.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-24 20:00:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-24 20:00:34.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_fwwTFxW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/common-causes-of-failed-project-management/\", \"post_id\": \"5659\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-24 20:00:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-24 20:00:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"common-causes-of-failed-project-management\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5658\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2572\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1000w.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"720\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440514800,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2515,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Steps to Prospecting on Social Media","link":"4-steps-to-prospecting-on-social-media-2","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Traditional prospecting methods never change. It&rsquo;s the medium in which we use to prospect that evolves.</h3><p> <br/> Prospecting on social media benefits your personal and professional life. Whether you&rsquo;re searching for a potential client, a strategic partner, or a new hire, prospecting on social media is very productive.</p><p> We live in a digital world and all of our transactions&ndash;whether we know if or not&ndash;are tracked digitally. We can purchase an item, review a product, share an article, or like a social media post. All of these actions produce your digital footprint. And it is this footprint that is prospecting gold&ndash;especially when you&rsquo;re searching for leads.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re looking to reinvigorate your sales team, try prospecting on social media.  You may get some kickback from sales reps accustomed to prospecting on more traditional channels.</p><p> That&rsquo;s expected.</p><p> Inform them that prospecting on social media is executed the same way on traditional channels.</p><p> <strong>  There&rsquo;s No Need To Become A Social Media Expert. Use Social Media To Enhance What They Are Already Doing. </strong></p><h3> Step 1: Target</h3><p> <br/> First, you look for your target. This could be a person or company. There&rsquo;s a good chance that either will have a social media presence.</p><p> Here are ways to find their social media accounts:</p><li> <strong>  Check their website/blog. </strong>  Usually, you&rsquo;ll find social media links prominently placed on the site.</li><li> <strong>  Search for their name on a social network. </strong>  All social networks have a search function so you should use it! Keep in mind that some prospects have privacy settings which prohibit their name from being displayed in search fields.</li><li> <strong>  Check company directory. </strong>  Sometimes companies will list social media handles along with the employee contact information. <br/>  </li><p> Once you have identified your prospect, follow them. This process is unique for each social network. Usually, writing a nice introduction message will ensure your prospect accepts your connection.</p><h3> Step 2: Observe</h3><p> <br/> Once you have followed your prospect, you should observe them closely. Ask yourself the following questions:</p><li> <strong>  When does your prospect post?  </strong> Understanding the times your prospect is active is important as it helps determine when to engage.</li><li> <strong>  How frequently does your prospect post? </strong>  Understanding the level of social media activity is important as it conveys how likely she will engage with you on this platform.</li><li> <strong>  What are your prospect&rsquo;s interests? </strong>  Social media is probably the best channel to glean someone&rsquo;s interest. Use this channel to inform your pitch.</li><li> <strong>  How does your prospect interact with people?  </strong> Frequent posts are not a great indicator of interaction. Social media automation is rampant so observe the level of responses posted by that prospect. <br/>  </li><p> Observing your prospects actions will ultimately inform your pitch to them. Use what you observe to enhance your introduction.</p><h3> Step 3: Engage</h3><p> <br/> Engaging with users is a critical step in your prospecting on social media. Look for opportunities to interact.</p><li> <strong>  See if the prospect posts something about your industry? </strong> Responding to that post is a good way to break the ice.</li><li> <strong>  Did the prospect pose a question to his followers? </strong>  Take part in the conversation and make a comment!</li><li> <strong>  Did you find a nice article that may interest your prospect? </strong>  Share it! <br/>  </li><p> Overall, focusing on being helpful is the best way to engage your prospect. Helping to meet a need will cause you to stand out amongst the crowd.</p><h3> Step 4: Close</h3><p> <br/> After engaging with your prospect, begin introducing your company. It&rsquo;s best to make a logical connection between the duties of your prospect and the services you offer.</p><p> Start with a personal experience about how your product or service helped make your life easier.</p><p> <strong>  Remember, it&rsquo;s about the sizzle, not the steak! </strong></p><p> Focus on the benefits of your product. Use the information gathered during your prospecting phase to highlight the most relevant benefits.</p><h3> Final Thought</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Think about it this way: </strong> If you are going to a business mixer, you don&rsquo;t walk up to the first person you see and introduce your product or service.</p><p> Of course not.</p><p> <strong>  You observe their interaction with the crowd. </strong> You listen for what they are talking about and with whom they are conversing. Then you may participate in the conversation. Hopefully get a few laughs and pull them to the side and present them with your contact information.</p><p> Hopefully, that example conveys how prospecting on social media is similar to traditional prospecting. Now that you know, it&rsquo;s time to get cracking!</p><p> Happy prospecting!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 17:22:41.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 17:22:41.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-steps-to-prospecting-on-social-media-2/\", \"post_id\": \"8820\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 17:22:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 17:22:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-steps-to-prospecting-on-social-media-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8819\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4188\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Steps-to-Prospecting-on-Social-Media.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"872\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453805100,"author_id":258,"chart_url":""}

For many in sales, summer can be a demotivating time. Vacations make it difficult to catch someone in the office and get them to pick up the phone. Emails either go unanswered or your inbox becomes flooded with out-of-office replies.</p><p> Unless you are trying to connect with a company whose big season is the summer, your prospects are likely experiencing a decrease in sales as well. This makes it very easy for a decision maker to say no to any additional expenses during the summer months.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s time to put those months of no, no, no behind you.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s time to get out of your summertime slump and reinvigorate your sales team. It&rsquo;s time to get back to selling! You can start by:</p><li> <strong>  Having &lsquo;Back-to-sales&rsquo; blitzes </strong>  &ndash; When the kids get back-to-school, it&rsquo;s time to get back-to-sales. Give your team a reason to refocus by sponsoring a little healthy competition. Pick 1 day a week and make it a blitz day, where you give spiffs for just about anything and everything: most calls, most closed revenue, most social connections, most demos&hellip;what ever activity or results you need, blitz days can help motivate the entire team.</li><li> <strong>  Introducing new tools and learning opportunities </strong>  &ndash; after stagnating for the summer, kicking off the fall by learning a fresh approach or incorporating a new tool can get your team excited about selling again.</li><li> <strong>  Planning a team-building event  </strong> &ndash; After being away from each other and the office, plan a fun team event to get everyone reconnected and aligned.</li><li> <strong>  Partying with your partners </strong>  &ndash; your clients are likely looking to reinvigorate their sales teams as well, so invite them to join you for a baseball game, or a dinner cruise outing. Work with your marketing team to throw end of summer bash for all of your new clients. Give your clients an experience to remember and they are likely to spread the word, which can lead to additional business.</li><li> <strong>  Kicking off a Fantasy Sales Team </strong>  &ndash; another fun way to build camaraderie and boost productivity is through gamification. While putting together your brackets for your fantasy football league, create one for your sales team as well. Teams can go head-to-head weekly, either competing in certain categories (similar to blitzes) or by creating a point system for a combination of activities. You can keep the competition going throughout the fall with the two top teams competing in a Super Bowl of Sales. Or, apps like  <u>  Fantasy Sales Team </u>  will do all the work for you. <br/>  </li><p> If you have any innovative ways to motivate your sales team, we love hearing from you!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 14:16:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 14:16:30.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_aIaGcVm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/tips-to-recharge-your-sales-team-after-a-summertime-slump/\", \"post_id\": \"5663\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 14:16:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 14:16:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"tips-to-recharge-your-sales-team-after-a-summertime-slump\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5662\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2574\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-25-at-7.25.10-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"642\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440589500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

While outrageously invasive, big data is helping us do many things these days and might even help social impact investing. Some of Big Data motivations are driven by consumerism and the need for buyer research, and others are reporting information that can make serious social impact in a Good way. There is a new ecosystem of data-driven programs designed to help the poor save more, live better and discover economic security for themselves.</p><p> The US and other wealth nations have spent trillions of dollars in the past half-century trying to lift the world&rsquo;s poorest people out of penury, with largely disappointing results, reports Jason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal. He goes on to report a new generation of programs that have a different approach; one of basic financial planning.</p><p> It&rsquo;s become clear that most welfare programs don&rsquo;t usually do what they were purportedly intended to do. In fact they can create a vacuum of poverty it is hard to escape from. And this is where data is changing that outcome with a new charge in the area of anti-poverty policy.</p><h3> Baristas of the Future</h3><p> <br/> They call themselves &ldquo;randomistas&rdquo;, utilizing the scientific method they are staging random &lsquo;interventions&rsquo; in a series of controlled trials. Over the course of the last eight years the data they&rsquo;ve collected in experiments all over the world, from the poorest regions of Ethiopia to the United States. A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6236/1260799\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   report published in the journal Science in May  </a> </u>  found that the randomistas&rsquo; methods not only work but stick.</p><p> Some of their experiments include grants of livestock, business assets, stipends and even temporary lock-up access to immediate funds in savings accounts. The results are measured in percentages of food consumed (increasing where people were starving), acquisition of assets and the ability to save money. They used incentives like clean water, food, and accessibility; things that make sense to people who are living hand-to-mouth and day-to-day.</p><p> Up until recently, governments and donors were not using any scientific process to see if their efforts were working or not and were unable to adjust to what does work. Things have changed and large institutions including Princeton University, The World Bank, Columbia University and MIT. Showing positive sustainable results makes people, businesses and institutions who want to support positive social change more inclined to do so. This is likely going shift HOW we make those investments by changing how the game is played.</p><p>  &ldquo;The daunting realization is that we don&rsquo;t know what the hell we&rsquo;re doing in most fields of life, especially the ones that involve people,&rdquo; says Richard Thaler, professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and author of the new book  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-homo-economicus-went-extinct-1431721255\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics.  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  He adds, &ldquo;The alternative to guessing is to run experiments.&rdquo;</p><p> And so they have, recording the results of mostly way to address the phycology of poverty and it gets replayed through generations and social systems. It is much more expensive and challenging to navigate financial challenges when you are poor. You end up paying more for everything and use an inordinate amount of your time and thought process navigating day to day challenges as basic as avoiding over-draft charges and finding affordable sustenance.

As such, this second post of our two-part series highlights some areas that principals of investment advisory firms should be looking at when thinking about building an enterprise that can thrive and survive in good and bad market times.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/is-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-1-of-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Last week's post  </a> </u>  focused on the critical areas of:</p><li> Fixed vs. variable cost structure</li><li> The danger of selling investment performance</li><li> Client concentration risk <br/>  </li><p> This week's post addresses the final three areas of our six most critical areas that principals should be focused on addressing in order to properly prepare for and survive a market downturn: </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=4f8c0079-b031-499a-82c7-c680eba193dd&amp;placement_guid=651da216-62df-4d26-b802-2fc85e1c6463&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpHvM1NqSVcq899m_F5CZEH2g4gFs0_i217vpjz9qoD-BtSFEFNsyrS8o5jSB3fXyKB0ry3azOUJPW2A9acjJCfjfcVnffRJmvcr_2C_YVftiHO-NOv8MOWUUY8HE-zdMXn2B3o8yoMp9MguTn-RoCTEr5YqYlNiLCRu-80THuFwX0Vit1luvucSbk9g3prDkIBCfCAFFeBtdBx8x3KiK1rQBXEJ3wT_RzeaasTfqRIeE94zO13B67lfDXTgrBU1VDIKU8nP32hhJFdmR8KKuaHNfNP0mNMlId54evAaxvrj79VAr_w&amp;hsutk=f539e5b784fdee5527ab6158b29f4d57&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fis-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-2-of-2&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fis-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-2-of-2&amp;__hstc=69624975.f539e5b784fdee5527ab6158b29f4d57.1432824585204.1440446365521.1440515630062.16&amp;__hssc=69624975.1.1440515630062&amp;__hsfp=2878364565\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Download Our Free How to Prepare for an RIA Regulatory Exam Checklist  </a> </u></p><li> Understanding the Power and Danger of the AUM Fee Model: As we've  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/is-sales-or-better-client-retention-the-best-way-to-grow-an-ria-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussed before  </a> </u> , very few industries have the luxury of an established pricing model which has a built-in price escalator as the value of the client's portfolio, while often volatile, generally rises over time.  <u>  <a href=\"https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-allocations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vanguard notes  </a> </u>  that a traditional moderate portfolio (50% stocks and 50% bonds) has an average annual return of 8.4% from 1926-2014. However, the assets under management (AUM) fee model can also lead to a sharp decline in an RIA firm's revenue without any prior warning. As such, we are seeing an increasing number of successful advisory firms modify the classic 1% AUM fee model by reducing the portfolio management fee to be closer to 50 basis points (bps), or 0.5%, while at the same time introducing a flat annual retainer fee that is equivalent to around 50 bps based on the current value of the client portfolio. On one hand, this hybrid pricing model has less of a built-in price escalator, but on the other hand, it also provides more downside protection to the firm's revenue during a downturn. Much like an advisor may look to hedge a client's investment portfolio to mitigate a potential risk, this model allows an advisor to hedge the firm's revenue stream by trading some potential upside for downside protection. Given that we generally see that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/is-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-1-of-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advisory firms carry far too high a percentage of fixed costs  </a> </u> , downside revenue protection can be quite valuable. <br/>   <li>  Our Recommendation: While by no means do we advocate that RIA firms abandon the compelling AUM-based pricing model, firms may want to consider \"de-risking\" the pricing structure by coupling AUM-based pricing with flat retainer fees tied to holistic services such as financial planning. </li></li><p> This simplified chart further illustrates the trade-offs between the AUM and hybrid (AUM and flat fee) pricing models in a bull and bear market:</p><p>   <img alt=\"Comparing AUM to flat fee model for RIA firms\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AUMvsFlatFeeRIAPricingModel.png?t=1440427713579&amp;width=573\"/></p><li> The Risk of Just Providing Portfolio Management: Two questions that serve as a good barometer for this risk are 1) what materials are being presented to clients during a regular meeting? and 2) what percentage of the meeting is being spent discussing the client's investment portfolio? If the RIA firm is not providing a  <u>  personal balance sheet </u>  to clients and more than 25% of the meeting is being spent discussing the client's investment returns, it's likely that the advisory firm's relationships with its clients are not as deep or as valuable to the client as they could be. A personal balance sheet allows the advisor to focus the conversation not just on the investment portfolio, but rather on the much larger personal financial picture. It also is a great conversation starter often revealing areas of opportunity for theadvisor to add additional value and even perhaps increase asset wallet share. In our experience, portfolio management is the most difficult way for an advisory firm to differentiate itself and should never be the key driver of attracting or retaining clients.  <br/>   <li>  Our Recommendation: Move quickly to offer additional services such as financial, estate, and tax planning or other family office-like services such as managing household staff or   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/does-your-ria-firm-firm-have-custody\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    bill pay   </a>  </u>  , to clients that add substantive value and are at less of risk being replaced during market downturns when financial belts tighten. </li></li><li> Preparing for Increased Regulatory and Legal Risks: In our experience as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/on-going-compliance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA compliance consultants  </a> </u> , client complaint volume is generally strongly inversely correlated to market performance. In other words, during and following a market downturn, the number of investor complaints spikes. Whether legitimate or not, such complaints pose a tremendous risk to advisory firms of all sizes given the potential financial costs. It's critical that the proper  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-supervision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   compliance policies and procedures  </a> </u>  have been implemented to produce detailed documentation that will be invaluable in handling any client disputes. Furthermore, be sure to increase client communication during times of market volatility to ensure clients are informed and to also review client suitability information to confirm that clients' investment strategies match their documented risk tolerances. When markets take a turn for the worst, it's vital that the RIA firm has the proper budget and capital available to increase its compliance resources. <br/>   <li>  Our Recommendation: Make sure to properly allocate for potential increased regulatory and legal fees given the increased risk of problems or client complaints following a market downturn.   <br/>    </li></li><p> Be sure to check back soon as we further discuss opportunities for principals of investment advisory firms to strengthen operations and enhance the performance of their firms.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 15:15:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 15:15:05.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_HM2xMt9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-2/\", \"post_id\": \"5667\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 15:15:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 15:15:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5666\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2576\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-25-at-8.22.40-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"604\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440597600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Why can&rsquo;t you just use this treasure trove of information to make your own financial decisions? Or subscribe to an algorithm-based service that will make the best lightning-quick decisions for you?</p><h3> A couple of reasons&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re good and you dedicate a lot of time online, you can definitely pick up some great information and strategies that the experts are sharing (follow me on Twitter by clicking  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shermanwealth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> !) The tricky part is making sure that the information and the strategies are actually appropriate for you and appropriate right now. We all know that, if we&rsquo;re not careful, the instantaneous nature of the internet, social media, and impersonal algorithms can lead to impulsive decisions that may not support our own long-term goals and personal risk profile. Quick reactions to new stock market &ldquo;darlings&rdquo; or to sudden market volatility can lead to choices that are not the best for your long &ndash; or even near &ndash; term financial health and growth. In fact, there is a whole science called Behavioral Finance that addresses how personal biases can lead investors to make decisions that actually work against the goals they set for themselves.</p><p> A good financial professional is able to sift through the vast amount of information available to you and determine what is significant to your strategy and what may just be a distraction. A financial advisor who understands Behavioral Finance can help you see where your assumptions, habits, and biases about money and investing may be leading you to get in your own way.</p><p> The new algorithm-based platforms are increasingly interesting and have a lot of merit, but the level of personalization is not yet very deep. That means that portfolios are based on broad criteria that may have nothing to do with your current situation, lifestyle, and goals. Again, this is where a trained professional will be able to view your unique individual needs and create a tailored strategy that is geared to you and not just everyone who matches your age and salary level. As more and more fiduciary financial advisors are starting to use smart algorithms as part of their offerings where appropriate, the key is &ldquo;where appropriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the clients&rsquo; best interest,&rdquo; the very definition of a fiduciary.</p><p> Think about it: would you rather grill along with Bobby Flay on your iPad or would you rather have regular meetings with Bobby, where he looks at the size and model of your Weber, the size of your shrimp, and the recipes you&rsquo;re trying to learn, and works with you to make sure you become the master of your own grill? (and shrimp!)</p><h3> The same goes for your financial future.</h3><p> <br/> While do-it-yourself is getting easier and easier, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s getting better and better. Look for a fiduciary financial advisor who also has access to the latest information online and is familiar with the latest algorithmic innovations, but who uses that information to get to know clients individually, and tailors a long-term growth strategy for them that will put them on the road to achieving the goals they have set for themselves.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 15:36:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 15:36:44.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_zZlycm8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/has-the-internet-replaced-personal-financial-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"5669\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 15:36:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 15:36:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"has-the-internet-replaced-personal-financial-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5668\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2577\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-25-at-8.31.30-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"588\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440617400,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2520,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Clear Communication May Help You Capitalize On Coming Wealth Transfer Wave","link":"clear-communication-may-help-you-capitalize-on-coming-wealth-transfer-wave","source_link":null,"content":"<p><strong>Sponsored by Fidelity Investments </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Over the next 30 to 40 years, Baby Boomers will pass an estimated $30 trillion in wealth to their heirs </strong> <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a> . Yet when it comes to having detailed conversations about how these wealth transfers will take place, many Baby Boomers (as well as older retirees) often fail to communicate effectively with their adult children about these sensitive topics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFidelity&rsquo;s 2014 Intra-Family Generational Finance Study* revealed that, while 75% of adult children and their parents agree that it&rsquo;s important to have frank conversations about wills, estate planning, retirement readiness, and eldercare issues, about four in 10 parents have not had detailed discussions with their adult children. In fact, one in 10 has not had any conversations about the critical topic of wills and estate planning. Moreover, when families do discuss these subjects, the conversations often lack depth. The timing of these conversations is also a cause for misalignment with 64% of parents and their adult children in disagreement about when these conversations should take place. According to the study, parents want to have these discussions after retirement, while their adult children want them earlier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result of avoiding these critical conversations, disagreement exists within families over important topics, according to the study. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>43% of adult children expect to handle caregiving duties, whereas only 6% of parents expect this to be the case. </strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>56% of adult children say their parents often worry about financial security, when only 23% of parents actually do. </strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Adult children significantly underestimate the value of their parents&rsquo; estate &ndash; by nearly $300,000 </strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Opportunity for Advisors to Demonstrate Their Value</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFidelity&rsquo;s survey results underscore the communications gap that exists between some parents and their adult children on a variety of wealth transfer and eldercare issues. However, they also highlight an opportunity for advisors to demonstrate their value by serving as facilitators of estate planning and wealth transfer conversations. In fact, both parents (61%) and their adult children (57%) in the study report that they are more comfortable talking to a financial advisor than to one another about these sensitive issues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIntergenerational wealth transfer is an important consideration for the long-term health of any advisory practice. In fact, 7 out of 10 advisors surveyed by Fidelity agree that engaging heirs is critical to the future of their business. <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a> While heirs often move inherited assets to their own advisor, Fidelity&rsquo;s research shows that there may be an opportunity to retain these assets before they are transferred. Only 16% of potential beneficiaries in a 2013 Fidelity study were opposed to receiving guidance regarding their inheritance from the benefactor&rsquo;s advisor. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2] </a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile most advisors agree that building relationships with the heirs of current clients is becoming more important, Fidelity&rsquo;s research showed that only 28% currently offer these services as part of their core offering. 2 These services include educating clients&rsquo; heirs on how to manage wealth, the tax implications of inheriting (and passing on) assets, and other estate planning services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProviding intergenerational wealth transfer as a core offering may help advisory firms forge deeper relationships with clients and their extended families. Fidelity&rsquo;s research shows that advisors who offer these services are more likely to report &ldquo;knowing almost everything about their client&rsquo;s financial situation as well as their personal life.&rdquo; 2 They also typically have higher average AUM and higher compensation than advisors that do not have intergenerational wealth transfer as a core offering. 2<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, clients who get this type of help from an advisor report: a better understanding of the tax consequences of passing on wealth, more knowledge about the process of transferring wealth to their heirs, and more confidence that their heirs will use the inherited wealth wisely. 3</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Broaching the Topic With Your Clients</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOne of the first steps to incorporating intergenerational wealth transfer strategies into your practice is to consider speaking with your clients about involving their adult children in financial planning discussions. This can be challenging, as families may not want to speak about end-of-life issues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile intergenerational wealth transfer offers a great opportunity for advisors to help their clients and grow their advisory relationships, getting the conversation started can be challenging.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFidelity research shows that some clients are reluctant to involve heirs in the planning process. Nearly half (48%) of advisors surveyed said that this was a main obstacle to providing these services. 2 Many (42%) also cited a lack of communication between benefactors and beneficiaries as a primary obstacle. 2<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne way to broach the subject is to share Fidelity&rsquo;s research on this topic with your clients. Assuming your clients are ready to have a family financial discussion, consider these suggestions for guiding the dialogue:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Encourage clients to initiate family discussions early. </strong> Generally, the earlier and the more detailed conversations are, the greater the sense of preparedness.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Help clients identify their core values. </strong> Find out what your clients want to achieve with their wealth, how they envision their future, and the type of life they want for their children and heirs. You may also want to explore whether it makes sense for the parents to establish trusts for their adult children or grandchildren.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Help clients ensure they have the right people talking about the right things, at the right time, in the right way. </strong> Define roles, determine what conversations to have, and choose when and how different people will be involved. Consider the personalities of each adult child, their proximity, their relationship with their parents, and other nuances that play into long-term decision-making and financial planning.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Follow the &ldquo;voice not vote&rdquo; rule. </strong> While all family members should have a role in the planning process, decisions should be consistent with the wishes of the parents or benefactors.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Commit to follow-up conversations to keep the dialogue going. </strong> Schedule as many get-togethers as needed and revisit plans periodically to make sure they still make sense.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people don&rsquo;t enjoy thinking about, let alone discussing, end-of-life financial and health issues. You can play an important role in helping your clients overcome their reluctance to confront these issues by encouraging your clients to communicate clearly with their families.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaking intergenerational wealth transfer a core part of your offering may not only bring about greater peace of mind for your clients, but it may also help you establish lasting relationships with your clients&rsquo; adult children and potentially grow your assets under management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also be interested in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/294518639;121576361;o\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Recruiting Redefined </a></li>\r\n\t<li>Take the Quiz: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/294518638;121576361;n\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Perspectives on the looming advisor talent shortage </a></li>\r\n\t<li>2013 Fidelity&reg; Millionaire Outlook Executive Summary: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/294518640;121576361;g\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gen X/Y Millionaires Not Sitting Idle </a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a> Accenture Wealth and Asset Management Services Point of View: The &ldquo;Greater&rdquo; Wealth Transfer-Capitalizing on the Intergenerational Shift in Wealth, 2012<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a> 2013 Fidelity Advisor Insights study, previously named Broker and Advisor Sentiment Index, was an online, blind survey (Fidelity not identified) fielded during the period of August 8&ndash;21, 2013.

{"original_id":2521,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Six Keys to Dominating Your Profession","link":"six-keys-to-dominating-your-profession","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Are you a server? Athlete? Salesperson? Recruiter? Doesn&rsquo;t matter. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;d like to share something I&rsquo;ve learned during my almost three-decade career, much of which has been as a business owner. These lessons will help you dominate in your profession irrespective of your particular vocation.</p><p> Before we get to that, there is one sad truth you&rsquo;ll need to accept&hellip;</p><p> Doing what everyone else can makes you invisible. Doing anything worse than everyone else can makes you noticeable in the worst way.</p><h3> You need to be able to stand out as in stand above. Here&rsquo;s how.</h3><p> <br/> Learn the traits first and the trade second. Jerry Rice wasn&rsquo;t the quickest, fastest, or strongest wide receiver in NFL history. Why does he hold virtually every imaginable receiving record? He holds them because he obsessively focused on honing all the necessary, foundational skills required to be the best. He spent more time working on vision, reading the defensive back, agility, hip strength, cardio capacity, movement, and so forth. I&rsquo;m sure he caught a lot of balls in practice too, but it was his dedication to those other areas that made him the best.</p><p> When I became a professional recruiter and started  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.milewalk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   milewalk  </a> </u> , I read a &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; recruit manual and then threw it in the garbage. I didn&rsquo;t want to give it to someone else because he or she might read it too. It didn&rsquo;t take long to realize it&rsquo;s more beneficial to focus on developing sales skills to operate the company. For the matchmaking part of the business, I studied psychology&mdash;as in read psychology books and interviewed actual Psychologists. This helped me understand why people make bad career choices and why employers make poor hiring decisions. To become a better writer, I read more (and I already read a lot). You get the picture.</p><h3> Set the trend</h3><p> Keeping up with the latest trends, fashions, current events, or whatever essentially means you&rsquo;re blending in with all the other keeping-up-with-the-Jones-s types. You need to be so far out ahead of your competition so you can try a bunch of things, screw &lsquo;em up, and fix them before anyone catches you. The greatest trendsetters spend little time watching their competition because they&rsquo;re too busy wiping the ocean water out of their eyes from standing on the bow of the boat. Think. Try. Fix. Repeat.</p><h3> Stay organized </h3><p> Get organized and stay organized. I know many people who can get organized one day only to be disorganized the next. This flip-flop is usually the result of all the shrapnel they&rsquo;ve accumulated from the explosions of other more disorganized people. Great organization trumps talent. If you have both, you&rsquo;re on your way to stardom.</p><h3> Automate</h3><p> Systems&mdash;even manual ones&mdash;make you more efficient and proactive. Why is it that my retail clothing salesperson knows precisely when to call me and already has all my shirts picked out? You know, the ones I really like because she has my taste, style, color preferences, telephone number, email address and a bunch of other vital stats in her computer.</p><h3> Never stop asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How can I better help you?&rdquo; </h3><p> In your personal life, you might not want to know. In your business life, you need to know. You can always do better, but just being better is not the goal. You want customers who will never ever leave you. If their replies to your questions resemble, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing great&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything,&rdquo; then ask them one more question. &ldquo;What level of service would it require for you to never consider my competitors?&rdquo;</p><h3> Go the extra mile</h3><p> If you want something you&rsquo;ve never had, you need to do something you&rsquo;ve never done. If you want to give the world something it&rsquo;s never had, you need to do somethingno one has ever done. It might be lonely along the extra mile, but you will live in an absolute ghost town if you&rsquo;re a pioneer. Trust me. You&rsquo;ll see what I mean when you get there.</p><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.

Well, today is that day and the days and weeks ahead will reveal how their clients felt about their performance &ndash; both in terms of client service as well as in terms of investment portfolio performance.</p><p> There is one place that the robo-adviser crowd is assuredly ahead of the traditional RIA pack that few people are willing to give them credit for during times of crisis: <strong>  client communication. </strong></p><p> Built to engage with clients via mobile and the web, robo-advisers as a group were collectively more proactive in providing guidance and assurance to their clients via blog posts, social media interactions and emai</p><p> l and text messages to phones.  While many financial advisers are likely to be on vacation or taking long weekends this time of the late summer, their ability to communicate to a wide range of clients is just the same as a robo: the best bet still is a robust, proactive digital communications strategy.</p><p> So, as InvestmentNews calls it the &ldquo;first reckoning&rdquo; for robo-advisers, it is also a status check for the traditional advice-givers.</p><li> <strong>  Does your firm have an established, consistent online presence that your clients are used to resourcing? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Are you present where your clients are getting their news (and finding out about the happenings of the stock and bond markets)? </strong></li><li> <strong>  As they check their smartphones for headlines, can they easily log-in from the same device to check their accounts or request a phone call or appointment? </strong></li><li> <strong>  As they scroll through social media reading what the pundits are saying, do they know where to find your take on the markets? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Make no mistake, these kinds of market environments can do a lot to help separate quality RIA firms from the pack.</h3><p> <br/> Proactive financial coaching, responsive counsel to emotionally charged money questions and the ability to tactically adjust portfolios are areas where humans have the edge. But, if your firm fails to meet or exceed the communications standards set by the robo-adviser, the market decline may not separate you at all&hellip; it just may prove to your clients that there is little difference between your firm and your less expensive robo-adviser cousin.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 17:39:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 17:39:38.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_JOMK3ml.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-market-correction-will-kill-the-robo-adviserright/\", \"post_id\": \"5676\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 17:39:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 17:39:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-market-correction-will-kill-the-robo-adviserright\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5675\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2580\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-25-at-10.49.23-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"541\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440586800,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

They&rsquo;re cynical, don&rsquo;t like being told what to do, and wear their social causes on their sleeves.</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t describe a brand-new human type&mdash;this sounds like Baby Boomers back when they were young and just getting started&mdash;only Boomers didn&rsquo;t have the communication tools, the connections and the 24/7 information that Millennials were born with and take for granted.</p><p> You would think from today&rsquo;s press that Millennials are the first generation to passionately take up causes, but Boomers were the first to care about the environment, protest against war and fight for civil rights and liberties. They just had to put aside their passions and playfulness when it was time to grow up and pay the bills.</p><p> The reason  <u>  Millennials can &ldquo;have it all&rdquo; </u>  and make their passions part of their lives as adults is because today&rsquo;s connectivity and social platforms give them the resources to do so. They can multi-task. They&rsquo;re comfortable using multiple devices at the same time, and confident that they can get what they want when they want it. Today&rsquo;s tools make them quick on their feet.</p><p> However, most of us have those same resources today, and can use them to the same advantage if we choose to do so. Just because you were born in a time when it&rsquo;s easier to connect with more people, have more conversations, buy more goods and get more done in a 24-hour day, that doesn&rsquo;t make you all that different from other human beings. We&rsquo;re still people. Our attitudes might be different, but we all have the same basic wants and desires: food, shelter, security, love. We all need to build and sustain human relationships and need to be offered, and take advantage of the best way to do so.</p><h3> Millennials. They&rsquo;re human, like you and me</h3><p> <br/> Does that mean brands don&rsquo;t have to pay attention to what Millennials want? Of course not. Just keep in mind that Millennials are not scary beings from another planet. They&rsquo;re human, like you and me. And any good marketer knows that in order to gain the attention of a segment of the population, you need to study them and understand their motivations. You don&rsquo;t have to go crazy dissecting every nuance of their personalities.</p><p> My point is that Millennials aren&rsquo;t so different from Boomers or any other generation (at the same time in their lives), they&rsquo;re just comfortable with today&rsquo;s technology and use it to live life the way they want.</p><p> When selling to this (or future generations) it helps not to shy away from social technologies but to embrace them as the new reality. Learn to use the tools your market uses to communicate so you can listen and engage with them. But don&rsquo;t panic&mdash;the headlines might be scary, but Millennials are not. You won&rsquo;t have to learn a new language to build business relationships with them. All you have to do is be a student of human behavior; a good listener and observer&mdash;the same as you would for any other market segment.

{"original_id":2524,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"9 Powerful Ways To Build Confidence","link":"9-powerful-ways-to-build-confidence","source_link":null,"content":"<p> During a mock trial, I was selected to be a witness and cross-examined by a criminal lawyer. The purpose of the mock trial was to give FBI agents an idea of how defense attorneys would try to distort our words and use them against us, especially in front of a jury.</p><p> We were in a real federal courtroom with real lawyers and judges. I had never testified in a court of law before&mdash;I felt inadequate, uncertain, and afraid that I would blow the case by saying the wrong thing.</p><p> Sure enough, I answered the defense attorney&rsquo;s question and she immediately twisted the meaning of my words. I wanted to say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; but she had already moved on to another topic. I was flustered and my lack of confidence plummeted ever further.</p><p> When she asked another question, I kept my answer very short. I knew that I risked sounding defensive but I simply did not have enough confidence in myself to engage with her at any length. Realizing that my lack of conviction about her client&rsquo;s activities would not present a real threat, I was quickly dismissed as a witness.</p><p> All I remember about that entire exchange is how crappy it felt to be both humiliated and impotent as a government witness in a mock trial.</p><p> Lack of confidence can rear its ugly head at any time. No one is immune because we are most vulnerable any time we&rsquo;re out of our comfort zone or experience change in our life.</p><p> Confidence is closely linked to mental toughness because it takes a strong mind to conquer fear, anxiety, and worry. </p><p> Our brain is naturally wired to pay more attention to negative thinking because bad news has alerted us to danger for centuries. Our cave dweller ancestors went out each day to &ldquo;get lunch&rdquo; not &ldquo;be lunch.&rdquo;</p><p> But not everything that is new or different is a threat to our survival these days. The good news is that we can train ourselves to be more confident. Here are 9 ways:</p><h3> 1. Isolate Your Fear</h3><p> <br/> In my case, I was afraid of making a fool of myself in front of my colleagues during the mock trial. I was afraid of what they might say and think if I screwed up.</p><p> Other common fears are: fear of how others perceive us, fear of being physically hurt, fear of commitment, or fear of failure.</p><p> It is important to dump the ego and get right down to the origin of your fear.</p><h3> 2. Take Action</h3><p> <br/> If you hesitate and wring your hands, your fear will only grow.</p><p> I should have prepared better, worked harder to anticipate the way the defense attorney would parse my words, and trusted my own judgment. </p><h3> 3. Deposit Positive Memories in Your Memory Bank</h3><p> <br/> We are bombarded with so much information that our brain stores information in a way that makes sense to it. </p><p> So, if you lack confidence, all your brain will remember about a specific event are those things that confirm you messed up. </p><p> If you hold a memory freighted with lack of confidence, go back and revisit it to make sure you are remembering correctly. Often, you will find out that others did not perceive or remember an event the same way.</p><p> At the end of each day, examine it. Remember all the positive and good things that you said, did, or accomplished that day. Reflect on all the positive victories and go to sleep with those memories on your mind. </p><h3> 4. Withdraw Only Positive Memories</h3><p> <br/> It is easy for any negative thought, with enough encouragement and recall, to turn into a mental monster. The best way to defeat it is to ruthlessly nip it in the bud.</p><p> Find at least 3 things every day for which to be grateful. Write them down. Smile when you think of them.</p><p> Successful leaders move forward with confidence because they learn from their fears and failures, and then let them go. </p><h3> 5. Respect Yourself</h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t respect yourself, why should anyone else? I can&rsquo;t think of any situation where a doormat is someone who is respected. </p><p> If you are not in a situation where you do not feel respect from others, change your situation; do not walk&mdash;run. The devil you don&rsquo;t know is NOT worse than the devil you know.</p><p> Perhaps this means changing friends, jobs, or relationships&mdash;whatever it takes, place yourself in a position where you respect yourself and others reciprocate these positive feelings.</p><h3> 6. Sit In The Front Row</h3><p> <br/> I always sat in the front row of every class I ever took. It takes confidence to sit in the front row and be noticed, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. </p><p> Start today and sit in the front row of every meeting, conference, or class you attend. Start getting comfortable with being noticed.</p><h3> 7. Make Eye Contact</h3><p> <br/> Body language is important in building confidence. I immediately categorize people who do not look me in the eye as losers, whether they are or not. This means they have to work extra hard to convince me they are not.</p><p> Failure to make eye contact indicates either 1) they feel inferior to you and lack confidence, or 2) they are guilty of something.</p><p> This may be a great clue when interviewing suspects, but it&rsquo;s not the message you want to be sending to your team members.</p><h3> 8. Walk Faster</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve had people come up to me out of a crowd and say they knew I was an FBI agent because of the way I walked&mdash;fast!</p><p> You know what, my time is important, and where I&rsquo;m going is important&mdash;or I wouldn&rsquo;t be going. Don&rsquo;t be an average walker, or an average thinker. Moving with intention says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be successful.&rdquo;</p><h3> 9. Speak Up</h3><p> <br/> A sign of a true milquetoast is someone who doesn&rsquo;t speak up. Instead, they feel their opinions don&rsquo;t matter and that no wants to hear them.</p><p> Each time you clam up you are injecting more confidence-poison into your system. Your feeling of inferiority and inadequacy will just keep growing.</p><p> Bite the bullet and speak up! Practice what you are going to say ahead of time so it sounds good. Keep it short and pithy. </p><p> You will be amazed at how good it feels!</p><p> How do you build your confidence?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 17:52:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 17:52:05.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_WzmD8vZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/9-powerful-ways-to-build-confidence/\", \"post_id\": \"5682\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 17:52:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 17:52:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"9-powerful-ways-to-build-confidence\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5681\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2583\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440431261965-1df24284dcff-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"690\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440608400,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

Employer benefits also flow more freely to people at the top.</p><p> The newly released survey of employers by the U.S. Bureau of Labor shows how stark the differences are.</p><p> The charts below compare the share of private-sector workers in the lowest income bracket who receive benefits &ndash; their earnings are in the bottom 25 percent of all U.S. workers&rsquo; earnings &ndash; with the share in the top 25 percent. Four benefits are compared: health insurance, the percent of health premiums paid by employers, paid sick leave, and &ndash; since it&rsquo;s August &ndash; paid vacations.</p><p> The BLS data don&rsquo;t tell the full story. First, no adjustments are made for age, and many low-wage young adults might work part-time or be loosely attached to the formal labor force. Also the healthcare landscape has shifted since enactment of the Affordable Care Act, and lower-income people who lacked access to employer health insurance can now buy it through exchanges in their states. The White House estimates that some 11 million Americans are enrolled, while millions more receive health coverage through Medicaid. Not shown in these charts is the large segment of the labor force employed by federal, state and local governments which, according to BLS data, tend to provide more benefit coverage to their lower-paid employees.</p><p> Nevertheless, disparities have been shown in rigorous studies of another type of benefit: retirement savings plans. For example, a 2014 study focused on  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/low-income-why-only-12-save-to-retire/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   low-income older workers  </a> </u>  by the Center for Retirement Research, which supports this blog, found that only 12 percent save money in 401(k)-style plans; the BLS and other data suggest similar disparities in 401(k) participation among all workers, depending on their incomes.</p><p> A note about the BLS charts: They represent the percentage of private-sector employees in the high- and low-income groups who were actually receiving benefits in March. [The BLS survey also shows the percentage of people with access to a benefit &ndash; whether or not they use it &ndash; and the percentage of people with access who actually enroll; to see this data, click  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .]</p><p> With these caveats in mind, here the are the charts:</p><p> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/All-4-charts.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"4 bar charts\" src=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/All-4-charts-1024x890.jpg\"/> </a></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 17:54:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 17:54:04.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_i4QkDaA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/workplace-benefit-inequality/\", \"post_id\": \"5684\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 17:54:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 17:54:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"workplace-benefit-inequality\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5683\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2584\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440492248262-6895f9da82fc.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"454\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440612000,"author_id":280,"chart_url":""}

The economy continues improving, and many people who delayed exiting their businesses years ago due to the recession are finally taking the leap. Many of these are baby boomers wanting to finally retire.</p><h3> However, many are concerned about what will happen once they exit the business.</h3>Closing the business down altogether, passing it on to a family member or selling it to an interested buyer are all options, but there is not a one-size-fits-all solution.After running a successful business for many years, closing it down altogether could seem like the most disappointing option of all. While this can be the right choice in certain situations, some business owners feel like it is the only option. After someone has taken the time to <u> <a href=\"http://www.vesticor.com/blog/6-growth-strategies-that-helped-me-sell-my-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  grow and build the business from the ground up </a></u>, the last thing they often want to do is have to close up shop and leave loyal customers disappointed.Many business owners intend to pass the business on to children or other family members. While these successors may have long been involved in the business, whether that be working there while growing up, or taking on a management role as they got older, this does not mean they&rsquo;re the right option. Often, family members of successful business owners want to take a different path, and they are not as passionate about the business as the owners before them. Although many owners want to keep the future of the business &ldquo;in the family,&rdquo; it must go to the right person, not just the most convenient one.When <u> <a href=\"http://www.vesticor.com/2015/05/2-questions-to-answer-before-you-sell-a-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  owners determine </a></u> they do not want to close and do not want to pass the business on, one viable option left is to sell the business. <u> <a href=\"http://www.vesticor.com/blog/conquering-the-emotional-roller-coaster-when-you-sell/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  This can be a scary thought for many owners </a></u>, as they often fear leaving their hard work in someone else&rsquo;s hands. However, there are many interested and qualified buyers out there that would do a great job running the business. Finding those buyers is the tricky part. Working with a mergers and acquisitions specialist will help to achieve a good deal and a smooth transition. They&rsquo;ll assist in valuations, finding buyers and doing their due diligence. They&rsquo;re also somewhat of a hand holder for those selling a business for the first time, who likely have many questions and concerns.The important factor to remember is finding the right people to continue driving the ship. Whether that be family members or a new buyer, transitioning out of the business owner role can be stressful. By taking the time to consider all of the options or consult with an M&amp;A advisor, owners can feel more confident and assured that their business is being put in the right hands.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 17:56:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 17:56:02.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_HElYnE1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whos-the-boss-choosing-the-right-successor-for-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5686\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 17:56:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 17:56:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whos-the-boss-choosing-the-right-successor-for-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5685\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2585\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-25-at-11.01.33-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1196\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440601200,"author_id":274,"chart_url":""}

Find the right balance for client contact. </strong>   Conduct a quick review of your ongoing communication strategies. Do you need to make any adjustments?</p><p> Should you ramp it up? Should you dial it back?</p><p> If you run a low-touch practice (intentionally or unintentionally), too much additional communication could exacerbate client concerns. You could turn concern into panic. Don&rsquo;t start sending rapid-fire emails or making extra calls without a plan.</p><p> Script your messages. Relate the current market to your long-term strategy.</p><p> If you run a high-touch practice, too little communication may show a lack of confidence. Your clients will expect to hear from you more often.</p><p> But how much is too much?</p><p> Look at your regular communication intervals. If you call your clients once per month, you may want to call them each two weeks. If you send a bi-weekly email, change to weekly.</p><p> As above&hellip;script your messages. Tie the here and now to the long-term view.</p><p> In all cases, balance comes from keeping it personal.</p><p> <strong>  2.  Offer to advise your clients&rsquo; friends and family.  </strong>  This is a great way to relieve stress and show that you&rsquo;re willing to go the extra mile.</p><p> By virtue of their success, many of your clients are being asked for financial advice. You may have helped them achieve this &ldquo;advice giving&rdquo; status.</p><p> Unfortunately, this can put them in the uncomfortable position of offering advice in emotion-filled times.  This can be stressful.</p><p> Send them a letter or an email offering your assistance. They&rsquo;ll appreciate the help.</p><p> And they may even send you a few referrals.</p><p> <strong>  3.  Show confidence in your team. </strong>   Be aware of the way recent events are affecting your teammates. They may not have the same perspective as you. Their stress could impact the way they interact with your clients.</p><p> Do they have compensation or job security concerns?  How is the market meltdown impacting their personal circumstances?</p><p> Take the time to offer your teammates support and reassurance.</p><p> The confidence you display in your team will be echoed in their contacts with clients and prospects.</p><p> <strong>  4.  Add more active management to your clients&rsquo; portfolios.  </strong>  This is NOT a recommendation to make changes for the sake of change alone.  But your clients need to know that you&rsquo;re on the job.</p><p> They want to know how you&rsquo;ll respond.</p><p> What opportunities does the current environment provide?</p><p> Will you be improving quality? Adjusting allocations? Reducing risk? Managing tax considerations?</p><p> These topics could be part of your scripted communication (see #1 above).</p><p> <strong>  5.  Take care of yourself by controlling your time and attention. </strong>   You cannot be on duty 24/7. It&rsquo;s too easy to leave the business news running non-stop.</p><p> Now, maybe more than ever, you need to take care of yourself.</p><p> Limit the time you spend at work.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget your friends, family and favorite pastimes.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re in the office stay focused. When you&rsquo;re away from the office concentrate on the other important things that deserve your time and attention.</p><p> <strong>  6.  Treat your best prospects and connections as if they&rsquo;re already clients. </strong>   Don&rsquo;t lose sight of the current opportunities to grow your business.</p><p> Your future clients want to hear from you.</p><p> They have questions similar to your current clients.  And you may be able to offer more assurance than their current advisors. Give your prospects and connections the same type of attention you&rsquo;re giving your clients.</p><p> During lousy markets, the opportunity to add new assets and new relationships will grow.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 17:59:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 17:59:51.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_Eb73eOs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-tips-for-stress-testing-your-practice-in-lousy-markets/\", \"post_id\": \"5688\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 17:59:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 17:59:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-tips-for-stress-testing-your-practice-in-lousy-markets\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5687\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2586\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440342324699-75e542689857-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"444\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440618300,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}

Apologies! I&rsquo;ve been focusing on a project that I can't wait to share with you! </p><p> <strong>  So when it came time to write this post, a few things came to mind: </strong></p><li> What the F@#$ do I write about?</li><li> Starting a habit after stopping really sucks.</li><li> How do people ACTUALLY dust themselves off and start again? <br/>  </li><p> And then it hit me.</p><p> I&rsquo;d write a blog post about writing a blog post. Not literally, of course. That would be confusing!</p><p> Instead, here are the</p><h3> 7 Step-By-Step Tools I Used To Deal With Change, Conquer Stress, And Start Over:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Stop resisting it.  </strong> When we&rsquo;re screaming &ldquo;no&rdquo; (internally or externally), we unwittingly make things harder. Change sucks, but resisting it makes it suck more. You can&rsquo;t move forward until you accept the reality of your current situation.</p><p> <strong>  2. Accept impermanence. </strong>  Habits are habits until they aren&rsquo;t. No matter how still your image of yourself, another person, or a situation may be, it continues to change. In fact, regardless of how you perceive something at this moment, the thing itself is changing. Stress comes from trying to force things to be consistent and static instead of accepting that they aren&rsquo;t. Simply put, stress comes from how you deal, not what you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p><p> <strong>  3. Acknowledge that change sucks.  </strong> Admitting that something is challenging helps you to validate your own feelings. As Dr. Crum, Stanford University Psychology Professor notes, &ldquo;Doing so changes the stress in your brain, moving it from the reactive amygdala to the more rational prefrontal cortex.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  4. Discharge it. </strong>  Option 1: Call your brother at midnight to vent (Yup, just did that), or the less dramatic Option 2: Write out your best and worst-case scenarios on paper in order to clearly develop a rational plan. There&rsquo;s something about seeing our crazy in black and white that makes us put on our big girl pants and get shit done.</p><p> <strong>  5. Use the stress response proactively.  </strong> Instead of letting it crush you, use it to help you adapt. What can you do differently next time? What&rsquo;s the hidden lesson? Use stress as a helpful guide, rather than your enemy.</p><p> <strong>  6. Be gentle. </strong> Have some self-compassion. Increase your self-care and trust that when everything is up in the air, it will come back together more beautiful, organized, and aligned than before. </p><p> <strong>  7.  Ice cream.  </strong> A warm baguette also does quite nicely.</p><p> P.S.

When he was in conversation with someone, he gave them his full, undivided attention. It was as if whoever he was speaking with was the only person in the room. It was a phenomenal thing to witness, let alone be a recipient of. </strong></p><p> By doing this, not only did he empower his team to perform at their best, but the ripple effect of his listening abilities spread throughout the entire organisation.</p><p> When I broached the topic of his skill with him, he confided that early on in his life, he was the recipient of &lsquo;deep listening&rsquo; from a teacher. It had such a profound impact on him, he vowed to cultivate this powerful (and unfortunately, rare) skill.</p><p> <strong>  The more I learn about leadership, the more I have come to believe &ndash; with all my head, heart and soul &ndash; the most powerful tool for a leader to develop is the ability to listen. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m not talkin&rsquo; about &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only waiting for you to finish your bit so I can say my piece&rdquo; listening. Or, &ldquo;I have a million deadlines to meet so let&rsquo;s wind this word-fest up real quick&rdquo; listening. Or even, &ldquo;let me stop you right there and tell you what to do so I feel clever&rdquo; listening.</p><p> I mean  deep listening  &ndash; with full presence, attention and intention to understand.</p><p> If leaders practiced this type of deep listening with their team members, managers, customers, suppliers and each other, there would be an explosion of unleashed potential in organisations on a scale we have never seen before.</p><p> Research has found that listening effectively enables us to get more information from the people we manage. It increases trust, reduces conflict and enables a better understanding of how to motivate others. It inspires a higher level of commitment in the people we manage and the company we represent.</p><p> But deep, active listening with full presence, is also a rare jewel in organisations.</p><p> We listen to people at a rate of 125-250 words per minute, but think at 1,000-3,000 words per minute. Research shows that the average person listens at only about 25% efficiency.</p><p> Is this surprising?</p><p> When was the last time you had someone give you their full, undivided attention at work? Someone who just listened &ndash; without seeking to solve, put their slant on it, give you advice, interrupt, check their phone or start thinking about the next board report&hellip;</p><h3> Here are just four ways to cultivate this exceptional skill:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Ditch the distractions and look at the person</h3><p> <br/> Put down your device of choice, make eye contact and give someone your complete attention. What message does it send to your team, let alone the person you&rsquo;re talking to, if they sense you&rsquo;re just not that into it?</p><h3> 2. Suspend judgement</h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t listen to understand if you are already crafting your response, or jumping to judgement mode. Truly empathetic listening cannot occur if you are positional. Seek to understand this person&rsquo;s frame of reference. Put yourself in their shoes. Perhaps especially if you disagree or have a vastly different perspective. Yes, that&rsquo;s tough.</p><h3> 3. Become an expert at paraphrasing and reflecting back what you&rsquo;ve heard</h3><p> <br/> As well as letting the other person know you have given them the courtesy of your attention, it&rsquo;s an excellent mechanism for avoiding assumptions &ndash; and miscommunication.</p><h3> 4. Sift for nuggets in the conversation and probe more around these</h3><p> <br/> Body language and &lsquo;charged&rsquo; words or phrases are good clues to delve deeper. Phrases like &ldquo;tell me more about that&rdquo; and &ldquo;what do you mean when you say&hellip;&rdquo; should be part of your regular conversational repertoire.</p><p> When we listen in this way, people feel seen and heard.</p><p> When people feel seen and heard, they perform at their best.</p><p> When people perform at their best, we are doing our job as a leader.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-25 18:06:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-25 18:06:24.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_4WdWqnx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-listening-is-the-mother-of-all-leadership-skills-and-4-ways-to-cultivate-it/\", \"post_id\": \"5692\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-25 18:06:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-25 18:06:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-listening-is-the-mother-of-all-leadership-skills-and-4-ways-to-cultivate-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5691\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2588\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iStock_Travenian_listening.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"780\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440594000,"author_id":467,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2530,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"These Billionaire Investors Just Made Massive Bets on Gold and Airlines","link":"these-billionaire-investors-just-made-massive-bets-on-gold-and-airlines","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I always advise investors to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/follow-the-smart-money-how-the-pros-are-trading-right-now/#.VdN-G_50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   follow the smart money  </a> </u> , and two people high on the list are Stanley Druckenmiller and Warren Buffett.</p><p> Second-quarter regulatory filings show that Stanley Druckenmiller, the famed hedge fund manager, just placed more than $323 million of his own money into a gold ETF, at a time when sentiment toward the yellow metal is in the basement. Meanwhile, Buffett announced this week that Berkshire Hathaway is purchasing aircraft parts supplier Precision Castparts for $32 billion.</p><p> <strong>  Investors should take note! </strong></p><h3> Druckenmiller Sees Gold as a &ldquo;Home Run&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Druckenmiller has commented in the past that if he sees something that really excites him, he&rsquo;ll bet the ranch on it.</p><p> &ldquo;The way to build long-term returns is through preservation of capital and home runs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Grind it out until you&rsquo;re up 30 to 40 percent, and then if you have the convictions, go for a 100-percent year.&rdquo;</p><p> While I have always advocated for a diversified approach, this all-in approach has served him well. Between 1986 and 2010, the year he closed his fund to investors, Druckenmiller consistently delivered 30 percent on an average annual basis. Thirty percent a year! That&rsquo;s a superhuman, Michael Jordan-caliber performance&mdash;or Ted Williams, if we want to stick to baseball imagery. The point is that words such as &ldquo;legendary&rdquo; and &ldquo;titan&rdquo; were invented with people like Druckenmiller in mind.</p><p> During his career, the man has made some now-mythic calls, the most storied and studied being his decision to short the British pound in 1992. This bet against the currency forced the British government to devalue the pound and withdraw it from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which is why many people say the trade &ldquo;broke the Bank of England.&rdquo; It also made Quantum, George Soros&rsquo;s hedge fund, $1 billion.</p><p> And now he&rsquo;s making a call on gold. The $323-million investment is currently the single largest position in Druckenmiller&rsquo;s family fund. It&rsquo;s twice as large, in fact, as its second-largest position, Facebook, and amounts to 20 percent of total fund holdings.</p><p> His conviction in gold can be traced to his criticism of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s policy of massive money-printing and near-zero interest rates. Such ongoing low rates push investors and central banks alike into other types of assets, including physical gold.</p><p> Concerns over government policy is why prudent investors hope for the best but prepare for the worst. I&rsquo;ve always advocated a 10-percent weighting in gold: 5 percent in gold stocks, 5 percent in bullion, then rebalance every year. This is the case in good times and in bad.</p><h3> Trump on Gold</h3><p> <br/> Love him or hate him as a presidential candidate, Donald Trump has the same attitude toward owning gold in today&rsquo;s easy-money economy. After leasing a floor of the Trump Building to Apmex, a precious metals exchange, he agreed back in 2011 to accept three 32-ounce bars of gold as the security deposit, according to TheStreet.</p><p> The U.S. dollar, Trump says, is &ldquo;not being sustained by proper policy and proper thinking.&rdquo; Accepting the gold &ldquo;was an opportunity&hellip; to show people what&rsquo;s happening with the dollar so we can do something about it.&rdquo;</p><p> Trump and Druckenmiller aren&rsquo;t the only ones adding to their gold positions right now. As I told Daniela Cambone on this week&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/adclick.cfm?adid=11541\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gold Game Film  </a> </u> , the Chinese government is now reporting its gold consumption on a monthly basis. In July it purchased 54 million ounces. This is significant in the country&rsquo;s march to become a world-class currency that&rsquo;s supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for special drawing rights.</p><p> Both of our precious metals funds,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/gold-and-precious-metals-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gold and Precious Metals Fund (USERX)  </a> </u>  and  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/world-precious-minerals-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   World Precious Minerals Fund (UNWPX)  </u>  , </a>  aim to offer protection against the sort of monetary instability Druckenmiller and Trump have warned us about.</p><h3> Buffett Makes the Biggest Deal of His Career in Airlines</h3><p> <br/> Many investors know that Warren Buffett has been hard on the airline industry in the past, even going so far as to say, in his 2008 letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors, that &ldquo;if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville [Wright] down.&rdquo;</p><p> But since then it appears as if he&rsquo;s come around&mdash;in a huge way. At more than $32 billion, his purchase of Precision Castparts is the largest-ever takeover in the aerospace sector, not to mention the largest deal Buffett&rsquo;s ever been involved in.</p><p> More than that, though, the deal implies that Buffett, 85, sees great opportunity in the sector where previously he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p> Indeed, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/warren-buffett-may-bet-on-aerospace-boom-to-lift-a-precision-castparts-deal-1439075608\" target=\"_blank\">   Wall Street Journal  </a> </u>  writes that the acquisition comes &ldquo;as airlines&rsquo; seemingly insatiable appetite for new fuel-efficient jets in the past several years has left Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. with combined orders on the books for over 10,000 jets.&rdquo;</p><p> A couple of months ago, I shared with you Boeing&rsquo;s estimate that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/us-economy-turns-on-the-afterburners-is-a-rate-hike-next/#.VdOdNf50zcs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $5.6 trillion in new aircraft orders  </a> </u>  will be placed over the course of the next 20 years.

From ordering a pizza to mapping our directions to starting the dishwasher, we use our phones to feed us, to find us, and even to clean us.These are of course the rather menial tasks, for which apps can offer solutions that have been designed with increased convenience in mind. They are by no means essential, or even particularly consequential should one day we find ourselves without them.But, when it comes to ordering our finances, our mobile phones are becoming ever more important. In these times, we find ourselves in the rising realms of  <u>  financial technology (FinTech) </u> , whereby there is slowly being invented an alternative digital solution to each and every financial activity that we might have had to once do manually.From  <u>  <a href=\"http://traxpay.com/2015/03/brazil-mexico-and-chile-still-the-greatest-adopters-of-e-invoicing-an-international-market-overview-forecast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   electronic invoicing systems  </a> </u>  to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/procure-to-pay-solution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   P2P alternative lending platforms  </a> </u> , and from  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apple Pay  </a> </u>  to  <u>  <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bitcoin  </a> </u>  &ndash; FinTech is a rather large umbrella term that encompasses it all. There is a lot of media attention on the sector at the moment, largely describing how the various FinTech and alternative finance platforms are beginning to amount a rather serious disruptive challenge to the banking system as we know it.Now, whilst that is most evidently true to a certain extent, it&rsquo;s safe to say that the big banks aren&rsquo;t going anywhere just yet (it will take another five years, according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kpmg.com/UK/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/PDF/Market%20Sector/Financial%20Services/the-changing-world-of-money.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   report by KPMG  </a> </u> , for the AltFi industry to claw just 10% of loans away from banks), so there&rsquo;s no need to rush out now and close your bank account immediately.On the contrary, as the FinTech revolution continues to make waves, the banks are responding with their own digital and technological solutions in order to compete, and if you&rsquo;ve got a smartphone, then the chances are that you do as well.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s All About Convenience</h3>A recent <u> <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201503.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  report from the US Federal Reserve </a></u> has found, as stated on <u> <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/smart-phones-are-revolutionizing-consumer-banking-habits/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  cbsnews.com </a></u>, that:&ldquo;87% of U.S. adults have a mobile phone, and 71% of those mobile phones are Internet-enabled smartphones, a rise of 10% from a year earlier.\"&ldquo;The survey also found that 39% of adults with both mobile phones and bank accounts reported using mobile banking &ndash; a 33% increase in usage from 2013.&rdquo;People frequently <u> <a href=\"https://www.calbanktrust.com/personal-banking/checking-savings/online-banking/mobile-banking.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  turn to their phones to handle their banking needs </a></u>, such as managing accounts, transferring money and even paying for items at the checkout counter. Banking on our phones has become so mainstream that the thought of ever having to go back to the offline days is overwhelming. However, while banking on your phone is convenient, experts also warn about security risks.<h3> The Pros Of Mobile Banking</h3>Many people agree that banking on your phone <u> is an advantageous tool</u> that fits handsomely into our ever-evolving world. It is simply online banking taken to the next level. Banks and financial institutions are even releasing applications for a variety of smartphone operating systems to make banking on a phone easy for their customers. While convenience is the undeniable primary benefit of mobile banking, other pros include:<li> Ease of paying bills</li><li> Ability to access accounts</li><li> Simple to set up and use</li>By allowing the customer to handle basic money management at any time and place, mobile banking is proving to be extremely appealing to those who find the time to do traditional banking a challenge.<h3> The Cons Of Mobile Banking</h3>Admittedly there isn&rsquo;t a lot of downside to mobile banking but there are a few things that many customers would change if they could. For example, one of the major drawbacks associated with managing money on your phone <u> is security</u>. With the increase of electronic identity theft, proper safety and security measures must be taken when handling finances on your phone to avoid vulnerability should your device be stolen, hacked, or encounter any other problems.Customers of mobile banking would be happier, in general, if they could see improvements in the following three areas:<li> Increased security</li><li> Reduced transaction problems</li><li> Available balance access issues</li>Of these three, it is only the first point that can actually be described as a risk &ndash; the other two are largely concerned with UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) issues, which the various apps available are constantly trying to iron out.But, when it comes to security, the issue is a very serious one indeed. If mobile bank customers aren&rsquo;t careful, scammers, hackers and thieves could potentially compromise their personal information and hard-earned money.<h3> Tips for Safe and Secure Banking on Your Phone</h3>Regardless of the dangers associated with banking by phone, mobile banking is here to stay. Mobile banking will undoubtedly make your life easier, and, if you undertake some vigilant precautions to always ensure that your transactions are secure, then making the move to mobile may be the best way to manage your finances. Some important tips to remember include:<li> Set your phone to require a password to unlock the device.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t let your banking app remember your password.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t save account numbers, PINs or passwords on your phone.</li><li> Download your bank&rsquo;s app &ndash; mobile browsers are more susceptible to security risks.</li><li> Report a lost or stolen phone immediately to your bank or financial institution.</li>Banking on your phone, even with its inherent security risks, may be a safer method of protecting your financial information than the old-fashioned way of handling your money on paper. If truth be told, scammers are more likely to access your account data by stealing bank statements out of your mailbox than by digitally monitoring your phone. But, that being said, you can never be too careful when it comes to finances and digital security &ndash;however, on the whole, mobile banking is considered to be a largely safe bet.Do you use mobile banking?

Discuss your Finances First","link":"planning-to-remarry-discuss-your-finances-first","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Are you planning to remarry? Saying, &ldquo;I do&rdquo; for the second can be a complicated venture when you are merging households. The longer you and your Intended have lived, the more opportunities each of you have had to accumulate property and debt. Before you make it legal, a visit to your  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.ca/rhondasherwood/your-team.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial advisor  </a> </u>  is in order so that you can discuss your finances and your plans for your life together.</p><h3> Planning to Remarry: Discuss your Finances First</h3>Going into a second marriage may mean being older and wiser, but not everyone sees it that way. Some people repeat the same patterns with money in subsequent relationships that they did the first time around. Before you make a commitment to your partner, you need to have that money conversation first.<h3> Merge Your Lives and Your Finances</h3>What happens if you are a spender and are carrying a heck of a lot of debt and your soon-to-be spouse is an avid saver and has built up a substantial net worth? What if you earn a lot more money than your spouse or have more financial responsibilities? Are you both in agreement when entering this new union that you will split all debt, assets and income 50/50? Or will it be, what&rsquo;s yours is yours and theirs is theirs? It is extremely important that you and your spouse are both on the same page about your expectations or assumptions regarding your financial house. I highly recommend that you both have a conversation with your own financial advisor and a lawyer beforehand to get independent advice on protecting what you have built for yourself up to this point in life.<h3> Discuss your Financial Goals</h3>You may have always dreamed of retiring at 60 and traveling the world; however, your soon-to-be-spouse lives and spends for the moment. Do you keep your independence and plan and save for the retirement that you want or do you both come to some type of agreement on how to spend those Golden Years and contribute equally to the savings pool? Being out of alignment with each other on important financial goals can lead to a lot of friction in a marriage. Avoid future arguments and built-up resentment by discussing your short and long term financial goals and plans to achieve them early on in the relationship.<h3> Making Your New Spouse the Beneficiary of your Assets</h3>If you have an RRSP, TFSA, life insurance policies and a pension plan, you have assets that require a named beneficiary. Before deciding to add your new spouse as the beneficiary it&rsquo;s a good idea to talk with your partner first to make sure you are both on the same page and if they have assets requiring a beneficiary they in turn will be naming you. Since you have been married before, you also need to be sure that your former spouse does not have a claim to any of your assets. In addition, if you have children from a previous marriage you may prefer to have your assets go to them. It might not be the most tax efficient way to pass on your estate but many couples prefer this strategy at least for the first few years of their new union. If you have young children who are still financially dependent, you may legally have to earmark assets to financially provide for them you should die prematurely. It&rsquo;s a good idea to seek advice from your financial advisor and your lawyer before making any changes.<h3> Documents You Will Need to Update on Remarriage</h3><h3> Your Will and Power of Attorney</h3>Both of these documents will need to be updated when you get married. Make an appointment to see an attorney before the wedding to prepare updated documents in anticipation of your new marriage.<h3> Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) Beneficiary</h3>You may need to update the beneficiary on your RRSP after your marriage. There are tax benefits to rolling your RRSP to a surviving spouse on your death, since the funds will transfer on a tax-free basis.<h3> Pension Plan Beneficiary</h3>Consider changing the beneficiary on your company pension plan to your new spouse after the wedding. This step is especially important if your plan has a survivor benefit.<h3> Life and Health Insurance Policy Beneficiaries</h3>You may also want to change the beneficiary on all life and health insurance plans, both privately held and through your employer, to your new spouse. (In the case of life insurance coverage, you may wish to designate your children as alternate beneficiaries in case you and your spouse die together.)<strong> Before walking down the aisle, have the all-important money conversation with your spouse-to-be. Second marriage survival rates are lower than first marriages because the issues are much more complex.</strong>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-26 15:30:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-26 15:30:41.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_PxVyWgb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/planning-to-remarry-discuss-your-finances-first/\", \"post_id\": \"5698\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-26 15:30:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-26 15:30:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"planning-to-remarry-discuss-your-finances-first\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5697\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2591\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-26-at-8.32.55-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"497\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440691200,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

You have lots of conversations, but there is no forward progress. In today&rsquo;s economy, there are in fact lots of sales conversations that go on and on without ever arriving anywhere. You can avoid this by asking a series of incisive questions that help you verify if the preconditions for a sale are present.</p><p> <strong>  The first precondition for a sale is that there must be a significant perceived problem or opportunity. </strong></p><h3> If there isn&rsquo;t, why would anyone hire you?</h3><p> <br/> To ascertain whether a truly significant problem or opportunity exists, you should ask questions like: &ldquo;What is this costing you right now?&rdquo;; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t fix this problem, what will the consequences be?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What do you think this opportunity is worth to your organization?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What other issues is this causing for you?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Would you say this is one of your top two or three priorities?&rdquo; And so on.</p><p> <strong>  A second precondition is that you must be speaking to someone who owns the problem and is empowered by their organization to fix it. </strong> In big companies, there are always lots of problems&mdash;and plenty of people willing to talk about them. But unless you are talking to the owner of the issue, that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll do&mdash;talk. Questions you can use here might include: &ldquo;Who owns this problem?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Are you responsible for fixing this?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Who would authorize an expenditure to address this?&rdquo;;  &ldquo;Who needs to be involved in the solution?&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Who would lead the implementation of a solution?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  A third precondition is that the buyer must have a healthy dissatisfaction with the current rate of change or improvement. </strong> The client may have a problem, and it may be significant&mdash;but they will not bring on a new service provider or supplier unless they are unhappy with progress or current solutions. Questions that can help to ascertain this would include: &ldquo;Would you say this is a minor irritant, at one end of the scale, or something you&rsquo;re truly fed up with, at the other end?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Why do you feel that now is the time to put extra resources against this?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What solutions have been tried already?&rdquo;; and  &ldquo;How effective have your own efforts been to address this? Why or why not?&rdquo; (Remember&ndash;if there have been no internal efforts launched to address the issue, how important can it really be?). </p><p> <strong>  A fourth precondition is that the client must trust you are the best resource for the job </strong> &mdash;better than your competitors and better than internal efforts. How do you determine this? This is harder than the other preconditions, because it&rsquo;s difficult to ask someone point-blank if they trust you! More likely, you&rsquo;ll sense a hesitation or reluctance. Nonetheless, you can questions such as &ldquo;What other solutions are you looking at?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How do you view our capabilities in this area?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How do you see your alternatives right now?&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;What concerns do you have about us or our approach?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Lastly: A sale will get stalled if all the right stakeholders have not been aligned. </strong> The first four conditions may have been met, but if there are key influencers or important constituencies who are not on board with hiring you, your client won't become a buyer. To ascertain this, you need to ask questions about the decision-making process. For example: \"Who needs to be involved in making this decision?\" \"What key stakeholders in your organization need to sign off on this?\" and \"With other clients, I've found that an important initiative like this rarely gets off the ground without the support of multiple constituencies. In your organization who would these be?\"</p><p> The prospect you are talking to may have had ten other meetings on the same day. If you want to be memorable, be bold about asking incisive, thought-provoking questions that demonstrate you&rsquo;re a peer and help you ascertain if the client is truly ready to buy.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-26 18:19:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-26 18:19:35.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_EtoFV5K.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-the-sale-is-stuck-5-preconditions-for-a-client-to-buy/\", \"post_id\": \"5702\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-26 18:19:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-26 18:19:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-the-sale-is-stuck-5-preconditions-for-a-client-to-buy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5701\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2594\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-26-at-11.26.26-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"600\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440801000,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

However, when we take up less space we feel less capable. When you stretch in the morning, it can help produce hormones to get your energy higher. Try a more expansive position or stretch before getting up.</p><p> Greet the day with a hug (cheesy, I know, but it works!)</p><h3> 3.

There are tons of studies about the power of green spaces and parks on productivity and relaxation. In Japan, there is a concept known as forest bathing, called Shinrin-yoku (森林浴). They say that forest air and being surrounded by greenery is the best form of meditation. Another cool fact: People with blue walls make less typos than those with white walls!</p><p> Get a plant for your desk!</p><p> After reading this study I got a little bamboo plant and named him Spencer, and now I absolutely adore him&ndash;it might be unhealthy.

And yet so many companies create an assumptive map and then leave it at that. An assumptive map, by the way, is a map that we build with internal stakeholders and is based on what we assume to be the steps customers go through to achieve some task with the organization. This is fine to do, but we must then take that map and bring the customer perspective into it. We think we know the steps, but customers are best equipped to tell us their journeys. Often, the most important parts of the journey happen between the touchpoints, and customers are the ones who can and need to tell us about those parts.  <br/> <br/> We also need to make sure we capture what the customer is thinking and feeling, and he is the only one that can tell us that. What he&rsquo;s thinking and feeling are important to identifying those key moments of truth, those make or break points on the journey. The map is a catalyst for your CX transformation &ndash; and identifying those points is critical to doing that. <br/> <br/> There are four steps/ways to bring that perspective into your map:</p><li> Make sure that you  <strong>  create that assumptive map from the customer's viewpoint </strong>  to begin with. How? Here's a tip to get your team thinking in the customer&rsquo;s voice: plot the steps using what I call \"I phrases,\" i.e., I entered my username and password to log into my account; I clicked the link to pay my bill; I then selected the dollar amount of my payment, etc.</li><li> Then  <strong>  validate the map with customers </strong> , using both quantitative and qualitative research. Through  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/08/validating-your-journey-maps-for-cx.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   validation  </a> </u> , we confirm that these are the customers&rsquo; steps.</li><li> Next,  <strong>  bring the maps to life by infusing the voice of the customer </strong> . Bring customer data and feedback into the touchpoints to really accentuate the pain, effort, or highlights of the touchpoint. You can even add metrics, e.g., customer effort score, to a touchpoint, which is my fourth point.</li><li> <strong>  Score touchpoints </strong>  (on performance and importance) to prioritize improvements and resource allocation &ndash; again, based on customer feedback <br/>  </li><p> The most important rule of journey mapping: it's critical to create maps from the customer's viewpoint and to bring in the customer voice. How many of these are you utilizing as you create your maps? <br/> <br/> Whoever understands the customer best wins. -Mike Gospe</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-26 19:00:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-26 19:00:23.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_QFA3tbQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-most-important-rule-of-journey-mapping/\", \"post_id\": \"5707\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-26 19:00:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-26 19:00:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-most-important-rule-of-journey-mapping\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5706\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2596\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CustomerJourneyMap_2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1471\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440684000,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

If you follow Karin&rsquo;s advice to go through an  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/6-secrets-to-a-successful-mentoring-program/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   effective mentorship process  </a> </u> , you are likely to develop a good relationship with a VIP at your company. Remember &ndash; &ldquo;Mentoring, at it&rsquo;s best, is a magical elixir which shaves years off your learning curve through mistakes unmade.&rdquo; A VIP such as an executive or other high-ranking person can recommend you or give you advice to get ready for promotion. <br/>  </li><p> Relationship development is a vital skill, especially as you move up through the management ranks. It is best to start small in developing relationships &ndash; sending one thank you card per week is a great way to start.</p><h3> Skills: The Rule of Three For Promotion</h3><p> <br/> Skills make the difference in delivering results in an efficient manner. In many professions, technical skills and subject matter expertise are the way into the door. At higher levels, leadership and communication skills take center stage. To land a promotion, you need to determine what skills are required. Use these skills to get control over your skills.</p><li> Review three job descriptions.</li><p> Job descriptions are a valuable source of data in your pursuit of promotion. Choose a target job title (e.g. &ldquo;IT Director&rdquo; or &ldquo;VP of Sales&rdquo;) and then read three job descriptions. The goal is to find common ground of the different descriptions.</p><li> Complete gap analysis for the three top skills.</li><p> Gap analysis is a way to draw a map from where to you are to where you want to be. In this case, where you are is your current job. Where you want to be is your target job title. Look into both hard requirements (e.g. must have a PMP certification) and other requirements for skills and experience.</p><li> Validate your findings with three people.</li><p> Sitting in a room by yourself is necessary but not sufficient for promotion. You have to reach out to your network and ask for input. With the job descriptions and gap analysis in hand, reach out to three people to ask for their advice. Specifically, look for people who already have the job you want ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/search?trk=advsrch\" target=\"_blank\">   Linkedin Advanced Search  </a> </u>  comes in handy here). You may receive validation for your idea or a brand new perspective.</p><p> Following the rule of three for skills development is an excellent way to focus your efforts. When in doubt, look for your skills you can develop over the next six to twelve months. In many cases, demonstrating a familiarity for the job&rsquo;s subject matter and a commitment to continue learning makes a big difference.</p><h3> Kill Your Bad Habits: What Got Here Wouldn&rsquo;t Get You There</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever noticed that you don&rsquo;t need to think about your daily commute very much? That&rsquo;s the power of habits. Habits also make a big difference in your work performance. If you seek promotion, then you need to avoid these mistakes.</p><li> Lack of Punctuality. Showing up on time &ndash; especially at meetings &ndash; is a simple way to demonstrate your professionalism. Bonus tip:  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/learning-development/getting-there-early/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   arrive early  </a> </u> .</li><li> Senior managers and executives have to act and make decisions &ndash; they cannot wait for perfect information to arrive.</li><li> Personal Disorganization. Losing track of appointments and meetings is an amateur mistake. Learn how to lead yourself with Getting Things Done.</li><li> Hiding Behind Email. As Karin explained,  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/3-communication-mistakes-screwing-up-teamwork/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   never assume they got the memo  </a> </u> . In management roles, you need the judgement to use a variety of communication approaches including meetings, phone calls and conversations. <br/>  </li><h3> Take Action To Get Promoted</h3><p> <br/> It is time for you to act to get promoted. Getting promoted at work means new challenges and excitement. Take a moment today to grow your allies &ndash; send a thank you note, buy a coffee for someone or simply listen to them. Relationships, skills and habits give you a great foundation for getting promoted.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-26 19:40:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-26 19:40:32.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_7sB6pNx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-promoted-at-work-the-ask-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"5715\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-26 19:40:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-26 19:40:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-promoted-at-work-the-ask-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5714\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2600\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-26-at-12.54.33-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"421\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440694800,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

In everyday language, ceteris paribus translates into &ldquo;every business plan or analysis assumes certain assumptions that must be valid for the analysis to be useful.&rdquo;</p><p> Here are a few examples:</p><li> Weather, war, inflation, the economy and politics can all affect business decisions but for some reason, they are ignored.</li><li> Markets can change dramatically and we ignore the consequences, i.e., iPhones, gay marriage, healthcare, the baby boomer generation, population diversity, are all factors that impact business in one form or another.</li><li> Social media continues to grow in its usage and impact on national and global events, drowning out other forms of media.</li><li> Internet shopping is growing in leaps and bounds, 20% per year; brick and mortar&rsquo;s growth? 2 % or less per year. <br/>  </li><p> The most important issue is bias, prejudice, and yes, even ignorance. I read numerous plans which start with glowing descriptions of the potential of businesses in the fields of climate control, or site sharing, or with amazing apps, however, most of these simply failed to recognize competition, expertise, financial requirements, marketing needs, start-up costs and timing. For example:</p><li> We frequently believe our idea or service is so great there is unlimited and exponential demand.</li><li> We believe our idea is so great that our marketing will go viral and not require significant investment to build the projected forecast.</li><li> We believe our idea is so great that we can price wherever we want without worrying about competition. <br/>  </li><p> There are numerous ways to evaluate your assumptions above and beyond your basic planning processes:</p><li> Simply research, state and understand your assumptions and parameters.</li><li> Never say this: &ldquo;we have no competition.&rdquo; Do an objective competitive analysis often, and ask these three key questions regularly:How is your business/service different? How can you communicate that difference? Do enough people care about that difference?</li><li> Develop a simple pro-forma chart, detailing sales goals, costs and marketing requirements. I cannot tell you the number of plans I&rsquo;ve read that market services for other suppliers and receive a commission of generally 5-10 %. The business plan counts the total transaction as income, not realizing that the only profit is the commission.</li><li> Ensure you have adequate expertise and staff in your business, and consider outsourcing certain functions so you get the best people to do it, as well as their objectivity. <br/>  </li><p> In summary, we simply need to take our blinders off and consider our challenges as well as our strengths.

{"original_id":2541,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Impact of Inconsistent Management","link":"the-impact-of-inconsistent-management","source_link":null,"content":"<p> All of us have experienced inconsistent management, where we had those days when our words or actions don&rsquo;t translate the way we intended or we take our stress out on others. Maybe something happened at home. Maybe the 15 meetings you have today along with the 5 deadlines are making you feel like you need to curl up into fetal position. Maybe the traffic on that stupid road that always has traffic for no reason finally got the best of you. Now your ability to manage and express yourself the way you want is impaired.</p><p> Often, between friends a simple &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m just stressed lately&rdquo; can repair these missteps because most friends cut you a break and know your words or behaviors are not malicious. The workplace, however, is a more delicate environment and a simple &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; may not be as effective, or even appropriate if we are talking about the dynamic between manager and employee.</p><h3> Effects of Inconsistent Management </h3><p> <br/> Although it may be hard to stomach, a manager can change the emotional tone of an employee&rsquo;s day with a couple of words, either encouraging or critical. Therefore, it is extremely important for a manager to watch how they reinforce their employees&rsquo; behavior and maintain consistency. Consistency is one of those workplace hygiene factors that can create stability and a stable work environment promotes wellbeing among workers.</p><p> If you change your tune on a daily basis by giving a &ldquo;Great job&rdquo; one day and a nitpicky criticism the next on similar performance, the employee will simply become confused.  The manager returns to their work clueless damage was just inflicted; the employee returns to his/her desk dejected and baffled. Inconsistent management can turn a great employee who is excited to come to work every day into a disengaged and annoyed employee who allows him/herself to become complacent and disinterested.</p><p> It is similar to a family dynamic. It has long been accepted that a stable home that offers consistency is the best home for a child to grow up in. It creates the nurturing backbone for a child to fulfill their potential.  An unstable and inconsistent home can lead to, well, I think we&rsquo;re all aware of the effects of unstable homes. The workplace is no different because not only do the same dynamics seem to play out but also, lets face it, many of us seem to spend the same amount of time with our work family as we do with our home family.</p><h3> Three Scientific Factors behind the Damage of Inconsistent Management</h3><p> <br/> This all may seem obvious but, many managers fall into the trap of inconsistency because no one handles their stuffperfectly all the time. However, there are three scientific factors behind the damage of inconsistent management so there&rsquo;s no getting around this.</p><li> <strong>  First, over time, repetitive inconsistent behavior like this on the part of the manager can lead to learned helplessness in the employee. </strong> Basically, learned helplessness means the employee once thought of themselves as competent and good at what they do but because of their manager&rsquo;s inconsistent reinforcement their opinion of themselves can degenerate and they can find themselves living in a state of confusion and fear.</li><li> <strong>  Second, we process negative information more thoroughly and more intensely than positive information, </strong> e.g. we brood over losing $100 more than we celebrate over winning $100. We&rsquo;ve all heard ourselves qualifying positive situations like, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s great but&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;This job pays well, but&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;My childhood was awesome, except&hellip;&rdquo; and so the bad story begins.  In a 2011 study by Terese Amabile, negative effects of a setback at work on happiness were more than twice as strong as the positive effect of an event that signaled progress. Even more significant is the fact that the power of a setback to increase frustration and annoyance is over three times as strong as the power of progress to decrease frustration and annoyance. Basically, negative events cause significantly more impact and are more soul sucking than positive ones. To make it worse, in a study done by Roy Baumeister, good stuff can make up for bad stuff but it&rsquo;s a five to one ratio (you need five goods to diminish the impact of one bad). So a manager&rsquo;s inconsistency can stick like superglue to the brains of their employee&rsquo;s even if he/she is generally a great manager.</li><li> <strong>  Third, there is a phenomenon called Emotional Contagion that deals specifically with the projection of attitudes and feelings and it is very simple: </strong> if you smile and are positive around someone they will feel good and most likely carry that positivity to the next place they go, which can create a ripple effect, and is pretty amazing when you conceive of how powerful a small positive gesture can be. The same ripple effect can of course occur when projecting negativity. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Take a moment and think about whether you feel good or bad around a positive person and/or negative person. It doesn&rsquo;t take a brain surgeon to figure this one out. <br/>  </li><p> Sigal Barsade, a professor at Wharton Business School, studies emotional contagion and observed that &ldquo;People are walking mood inductors, continuously influencing the moods and then the judgments and behaviors of others.&rdquo; In her research she has found that when participants are exposed to someone acting cheerfully in a group, the group behaves more cheerfully. When participants were exposed to someone acting in an angry way, the group became angrier. Positive emotions created more cooperation; negative emotions increased conflict and decreased cooperative decision-making. The effect occurs in every type of organization, in every industry, and in every large and small work group.</p><p> So what can you do to avoid inconsistent managing? Managers can take a moment when they arrive to work (or whenever necessary) to self-evaluate their mindset, see where there thoughts lay to make sure they don&rsquo;t project their own whimsical emotions on others. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being in a bad mood or giving an employee constructive criticism. What we&rsquo;re after is ensuring that whatever reinforcement we give is constructive and is based on the job done and not an irrelevant fleeting emotion that we brought into the workplace. We&rsquo;re all human, things happen, but we can better at training our minds and keeping our intentions, verbalizations and behaviors consistent.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-26 20:16:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-26 20:16:36.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ccQZBDn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-impact-of-inconsistent-management/\", \"post_id\": \"5719\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-26 20:16:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-26 20:16:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-impact-of-inconsistent-management\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5718\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2602\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-26-at-1.20.26-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"598\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440676800,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}

I want to respond, but I like him and don&rsquo;t want to offend him. <br/> <br/> &ldquo;Know-it-alls.&rdquo; There is one in every office.

I suggest trying one of the alternative approaches below, which let these opinionated people know that their comments are not the final word &ndash; but don&rsquo;t alienate them. You will speak up in a &ldquo;polite and powerful&rdquo; manner, and, as a result, feel good that you responded. These approaches include:  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Asking the person to explain his or her opinion by saying something like: </strong> <br/> -What information (or facts or data) do you have to support that position? <br/> -Why are you saying that? <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Acknowledging the difference in opinions by using lines like:  </strong> <br/> -I have a different viewpoint about it. <br/> -I have a different opinion, and here&rsquo;s why. <br/> -My research/information supports a different position. Let&rsquo;s compare notes. <br/> <br/> Regardless of the approach you choose, make sure you speak loudly enough to be heard, look the person in the eye, and do not have a negative tone in your voice. <br/> <br/> Also recognize that both approaches may lead to a discussion.

Start by downloading the free font  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/courier-prime\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Courier Prime Bold  </a> </u>  and install it on your computer. Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat or Reader and select the place holder text to add your own child&rsquo;s name.</p><p> You can also print the teal and yellow papers to customize your clipboards. We simply used spray mount on the papers, applied to both sides of the board, trimming to fit. We finished the boards by adding washi tape to the edges of the boards.</p><p> We have a ton more back-to-school goodies to help make the transition back to the real world go as smoothly as possible. Maybe try our back-to- <u>  <a href=\"http://liagriffith.com/back-to-school-labels/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   school stationery labels  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://liagriffith.com/school-lunch-labels/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   printable lunch labels  </a> </u> ? And stay tuned for our super-cute drawstring backpack project coming up later this week.

If you can&rsquo;t get it right, bring someone in to polish it for you.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t want to wing it when it comes to conveying your message. If you&rsquo;re lost for words and start using fillers like &ldquo;umm,&rdquo; it could hurt your &ndash; and your company&rsquo;s &ndash; image.</p><h3> Great video depends on great sound</h3><p> <br/> We can&rsquo;t overstate how essential audio is to video. You may be talking about the most interesting subject in the world, but if your audience can&rsquo;t hear you clearly, they&rsquo;ll go somewhere else.</p><p> This goes for lighting too. If you&rsquo;re hidden in the shadows, your viewers may not want to strain to see you.</p><h3> Keep your video short and sweet</h3><p> <br/> People often ask us &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best length for a video?&rdquo; Sometimes people are surprised by our answer. A minute is good. A one-minute video works because it doesn&rsquo;t ask too much from your viewer. If written well, it&rsquo;s more than enough time to convey one to three key points.</p><p> Note: there is a place for longer videos if the content you&rsquo;re sharing truly is great and people are highly engaged in your topic.</p><h3> Hold off on the hard sell &hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The best videos are not sales pitches. They solve problems instead.</p><p> If you focus solely on your company&rsquo;s history and successes, you&rsquo;ll bore your audience. You don&rsquo;t want them asking &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of this video?&rdquo;</p><p> The best approach is to use your corporate videos to help solve your clients&rsquo; and prospects&rsquo; challenges.</p><h3> &hellip; and close like a pro</h3><p> <br/> Corporate videos, just like brochures, emails and every other type of marketing material, should end with a call to action.</p><p> Remember that if they have made it to the end of the video, you&rsquo;re not bothering your audience. The viewer probably wants more. So help them out and tell them what they should do next.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-26 20:45:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-26 20:45:07.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_1CHK9Y6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-best-video-practices-for-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"5725\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-26 20:45:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-26 20:45:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-best-video-practices-for-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5724\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2605\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-26-at-1.52.47-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"292\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440695700,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}

But are you unknowingly guilty of these dumbest ways to earn a D in leadership?</p><p> Here are five extremely common bad habits to be aware of and intentionally avoid:</p><li> <strong>  Disregard your team&rsquo;s areas of expertise. </strong> <br/> Doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re actually good at stuff you don&rsquo;t understand, if you overrule them to gain control, you will make them feel frustrated, useless, and without purpose. Avoid this by being humble enough to sit back and listen to their ideas and suggestions, especially in areas where they excel and you&rsquo;re not an expert.</li><li> <strong>  Doubt your team&rsquo;s ability. </strong> <br/> If you create an environment of doubt in their ability, and skepticism toward their sincerity, your entire team culture will turn toxic. If you hire poorly, this will be harder to avoid. If you hire for character and skill, then it will be easier. Once you have good people in place, trust them. Give them space to grow, room to succeed, freedom to fail.</li><li> <strong>  Diminish your team&rsquo;s sense of accomplishment. </strong> <br/> The quickest way to do this is to hog credit rather than sharing it. Instead, try giving credit where it is earned, and refusing to allow team members to take responsibility for something they didn&rsquo;t do. Model an atmosphere where humility is valued, and no one grabs glory for themselves.</li><li> <strong>  Devalue your team&rsquo;s greater purpose. </strong> <br/> Start by making them each feel isolated in their own compartment, and before long none of them will grasp the big picture. Or you can take the opposite approach &ndash; one of transparency and communication. Show your team members how they each fit into the greater purpose. Give them ownership over the driving reasons why you do what you do, and foster deep, lasting loyalty.</li><li> <strong>  Destroy your team&rsquo;s feeling of trust. </strong> <br/> If you allow yourself to participate or enable gossip, backstabbing, jealousy, and power plays &mdash; you&rsquo;ll absolutely end up with a team that can&rsquo;t stop protecting themselves long enough to build trust. Without trust, you&rsquo;ll have constant turnover, frustrations and toxic dynamics that will stand in the way of performance and progress.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 17:16:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 17:16:39.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_1jOJAwB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-dumbest-ways-to-earn-a-d-as-team-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"5727\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 17:16:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 17:16:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-dumbest-ways-to-earn-a-d-as-team-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5726\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2606\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440367850806-da68da359421-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"662\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440765000,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}

While there are many roles one can add to an advisory firm poised for growth, few have a bigger impact than the associate advisor. <br/> <br/> The associate advisor, sometimes referred to as a junior advisor, typically focuses on client retention in collaboration with a lead advisor allowing the lead advisor more opportunity to develop new business and oversee the firm&rsquo;s most valued client relationships. The value of the associate advisor position is compelling. Research shows that the existence of an associate advisor correlates strongly with higher productivity, stronger growth and greater income&mdash;all characteristics of a firm that is building enduring value. <br/> <br/> Are you experiencing significant growth or feeling overwhelmed from a business development and client service perspective? Adding an associate advisor might be the solution. Read our tips to adding an associate advisor to your team and help drive sustainable long-term growth.</p><h3> <img alt=\"Tip 1\" src=\"http://images.tdai.tdameritrade.com/EloquaImages/clients/TDAmeritradeServicesCompanyInc/%7Beab90873-cf93-4ade-91a4-918847240a6a%7D_2015_08_06_RIA_LP2_1-1.gif\"/> Assess your motivations for growth.</h3><p> <br/> Your first step as you consider the addition of an associate advisor should include a look at your own motivations for growth&mdash;specifically, outlining where you want to be over the coming months and years. What are you hoping to accomplish? Do you have the infrastructure and human capital resources to get you there?</p>Ability to Meet Client and Owner Needs Are Top Motivators for Growth<p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://images.tdai.tdameritrade.com/EloquaImages/clients/TDAmeritradeServicesCompanyInc/%7B3ce1d643-79f4-4481-8238-32fda1e3b479%7D_2015_08_06_RIA_LP2_1-2.gif\"/></p><p> Growth does not always bring about the expected economies of scale. For some firms, profit, efficiency and productivity all decrease with growth. In addition, client service may begin to suffer under the pressure of firm growth, resulting in a decrease in client satisfaction. <br/> <br/> The possible negative impacts, however, should not dissuade you from pursuing a growth strategy. Instead, consider that by growing your business thoughtfully and with a plan in place that considers the human capital impact, you are setting yourself and your firm up for even greater success. In other words, by planning ahead for the challenges and putting the right team in place around an organized structure, you can effectively minimize any negative impact.</p><h3> <img alt=\"Tip 2\" src=\"http://images.tdai.tdameritrade.com/EloquaImages/clients/TDAmeritradeServicesCompanyInc/%7B536079e6-11bd-46ca-b446-0529694eab01%7D_2015_08_06_RIA_LP2_2-1.gif\"/> Determine whether or not you can afford to bring the associate advisor into your firm at this time.</h3><p> <br/> Without careful planning and an understanding of the initial economic impact, the benefits of the role could be eroded and may pose a financial strain on the firm. <br/> <br/> To assess affordability:</p><li> Benchmark compensation &ndash; Align cash compensation with your firm&rsquo;s objectives, reinforce the compensation plan with benefits, and implement professional development and retention initiatives to complement the overall strategy.</li><li> Estimate the total position cost &ndash; The cost of a new position includes cash compensation for base salary and incentive pay as well as non-compensation expenses such as insurance premiums, retirement benefits, payroll taxes and professional development expenditures.</li><li> Project break-even revenue &ndash; The benefits of the associate advisor role must, at some point, exceed the cost of maintaining it. You will need to consider the additional revenue the firm will need to generate in order to cover the cost of adding the position and maintaining your desired profit margin. <br/>  </li><h3> <img alt=\"Tip 3\" src=\"http://images.tdai.tdameritrade.com/EloquaImages/clients/TDAmeritradeServicesCompanyInc/%7B334d0cf6-bca9-43c3-8c3c-dbc4a4f39dbb%7D_2015_08_06_RIA_LP2_3-1.gif\"/> Get the right talent into your firm by getting your open position out to professionals who can recommend qualified candidates.</h3><p> <br/> There are many ways you can source talent. To find the right fit, you must outline your own value proposition to your target audience and develop an interview and screening process that identifies individuals with the skill set, experience level and cultural fit you&rsquo;re seeking.</p><h3> <img alt=\"Tip 4\" src=\"http://images.tdai.tdameritrade.com/EloquaImages/clients/TDAmeritradeServicesCompanyInc/%7B7cd5dd82-2d14-4eb1-8844-8dd72e5a2166%7D_2015_08_06_RIA_LP2_4-1.gif\"/> Have a defined onboarding plan to get your new hire up and running as quickly as possible.</h3><p> <br/> In order for your new hire to be a success, you need a plan for integrating the associate advisor into your firm and transitioning client relationships over to your new hire.

Which we did. The sun was still high on the orange horizon when we decided to make our final overnight stop in Blythe, California (only a couple hours short of L.A.) on Wednesday, a little more than 55 hours later. It was 109 degrees Fahrenheit in Blythe at six in the evening. (All the liquor store clerk could say was \"You shoulda seen it last week, when it was a hundred twenty-two!\")On a trip like that, it's hard not to think of Kerouac, who (of course) crisscrossed the U.S. many times, by automobile, flatbed, and boxcar, with side-trips to Mexico, with and without (in)famous fellow traveler Neal Cassady, Jr., that mysterious, bigger-than-life all-American miscreant without whose antics Kerouac's oeuvre would be slimmer than a road-flattened squirrel.Cassady turns up unannounced throughout Maher's book, adding welcome piquancy. Through Maher, we get an admirably accurate portrayal of Jack Kerouac (thanks to archival material that wasn't generally available prior to 2004), showing the iconic author to be perhaps a bit fonder of marijuana than previous biographies had him, and more definitively heterosexual, while also more introverted and mama's-boyish. The outlines of Kerouac's personality become clearer in the reflected light of Cassady, however, while at the same time, we get an edifying glimpse of  Cassady as being more than a one-dimensional psycho-brat who stole cars and juggled women; we see (a bit, at least) what Kerouac saw in him, which included a deeply thoughtful literary side. Cassady, like his then-wife Carolyn, was astonishingly well-read (having especially appreciated Spengler, Dostoevsky, and Shakespeare) and penned  <u>  <a href=\"https://ginsbergblog.blogspot.com/search?q=neal+cassady+joan+anderson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a 16,000-word letter  </a> </u>  to Jack in December 1950 that proved pivotal in Kerouac's writing career. Now known to scholars as the \"Joan Anderson letter,\" Cassady's rambling, stream-of-consciousness autobiographical narrative of mid-December 1950 was so transformative for Kerouac that he declared (in a reply to Cassady) \"it was a moment in literary history when I received that thing &amp; only sweetwife &amp; I read it &amp; knew,\" adding: \"If that ain't life nothing ain't.\"It was barely four months after the Joan Anderson letter that Kerouac, living in New York City, fed a roll of teletype paper into his typewriter and began pounding out his masterpiece,  <strong>  On the Road, as a single 125,000-word paragraph, which was completed in just 20 days (on April 22, 1951). </strong> Kerouac initially showed the scroll to close friend John Clellon Holmes, whose novel  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28Holmes_novel%29\" target=\"_blank\">  Go </a>  (1952) would be the first of the beat bestsellers (although Kerouac had previously published a Thomas Wolfe-inspired novel,The Town and the City, which fell into obscurity after lukewarm reviews). Holmes gave a supportive critique of the manuscript. The two went for a walk, and Kerouac said: \"You know, kid, your book and mine constitute a new trend in American literature\" (to which Holmes replied \"Amen\").But a few days later, when Kerouac rolled  <u>  <a href=\"http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-worlds-longest-and-best-paragraph.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   his scroll  </a> </u>  out on the floor in front of his editor, Robert Giroux, the latter was horrified, saying \"How the hell can a printer work from this?\" Kerouac was then urged by John Clellon Holmes to take the manuscript to his editor (Rae Everitt)&mdash;who was similarly horrified. Even more worrisome (arguably) was Neal Cassady's reaction to the novel. Cassady was not able to read the full manuscript (at this point), but in reaction to portions of it (and Kerouac's summary) he declared it thematically \"trivial\" and urged Kerouac to consider making it merely Book One of a longer, Proust-like three-volume set.</p><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eD915uQtP7g/Vdywfv8vEfI/AAAAAAAAEOE/XijytqW9cM0/s1600/CassadyKerouac.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eD915uQtP7g/Vdywfv8vEfI/AAAAAAAAEOE/XijytqW9cM0/s320/CassadyKerouac.jpg\"/></a>Neal Cassady and Jack KerouacWhen On the Road finally appeared in print in 1957 (after years of privation and wandering on Jack's part, with a side-trip to Tangier to see the drug-addicted Bill Burroughs, during which time Kerouac typed up manuscript pages ofNaked Lunch for Burroughs in exchange for food), Kerouac had a stroke of good fortune: Charles Poore, the intended reviewer ofOn the Road for The New York Times, a conservative critic who almost certainly would have savaged the book, was replaced (for that day's issue) by Gilbert Millstein, who hailed On the Road  as \"an authentic work of art.\" Millstein correctly predicted that many critics would misunderstand the work, but also pointed out that On the Road \"is the most beautifully executed, the clearest, and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat,' and whose principal avatar he is.\"From that moment on, Kerouac was in high demand for interviews (in print and on TV) and found a ready roster of publishers for his magazine articles and books; and yet, the money that came in ($100 to $500 for articles, $1000 to $5000 for book advances, plus a modest royalty stream from On the Road) was barely enough to allow Kerouac to maintain a modest house on Long Island and an injurious alcohol habit. In spite of (or because of) his new popularity, he still found himself firmly bound to \"the slaving meat wheel.\"In November 1966, just two months after his mother experienced a debilitating stroke, Kerouac married childhood friend Stella Sampas (his third wife), who was nearly five years his senior; the family moved to Lowell, Massachusetts two months later. In September 1968, Jack, Gabrielle (his mother), and Stella moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. A year after that, in a nearby bar, Kerouac aroused the ire of some African American customers who thought he was mocking them; they took him outside and beat him, breaking his ribs. On October 20, 1969, the 47-year-old Kerouac disappeared into his bathroom after breakfast and began vomiting blood. He was rushed to the hospital, where he received 30 pints of blood before being declared dead early the next morning. The official cause of death was \"gastrointestinal hemorrhage, due to bleeding gastric varix from cirrhosis of the liver, due to excessive ethanol intake over many years.\"Jack's death came shortly after Neal Cassady's. In February 1968, Cassady's all but lifeless, drug-overdosed body was found beside some railroad tracks in San Miguel, Mexico. (A nearby hospital was unable to revive him.) Ken Kesey, who had befriended Cassady four years earlier (when Cassady drove Kesey's party bus cross-country), paid to have Cassady's body cremated and the ashes sent to his wife, Carolyn.In his life, as in his writings, Kerouac campaigned against conformity, thwarting convention in word and deed, celebrating and exalting the point of view of what he so often liked to call (invoking Spengler) the fellaheen: the hobos, vagrants, drifters, itinerant laborers, and displaced nobodies of the world, those who haven't just \"dropped out,\" but rather, had nothing and no place to \"drop out of\" to begin with. To tell their story, he juxtaposed words, images, and thoughts in previously forbidden ways, thinking in French, transcribing in English, yielding up staccato bursts of experiential word-love, electric and raw. Encountering Kerouac's English for the first time is like being the first human to discover an eel. Shock and awe, old school.<strong> Paul Maher, Jr. has done an invaluable service by distilling the essence of Jack Kerouac's life into 555 skillfully researched pages, in a poignant, well-told story that paints a somber picture of a life cut tragically short by alcohol and demons.</strong>One only wishes the book were longer. <u> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Y34M7Z0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00Y34M7Z0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=asse0a-20&amp;linkId=A3O7HAB32QP6N7AT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Kerouac: His Life and Work </a></u>, by Paul Maher, Jr., ISBN 1-58979-366-8, Taylor Trade Publishing (2004).","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 18:42:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 18:42:17.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_GvfKmau.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/on-the-road-again-remembering-kerouac/\", \"post_id\": \"5735\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 18:42:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 18:42:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"on-the-road-again-remembering-kerouac\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5734\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2609\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-27-at-11.49.20-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1616\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440784800,"author_id":263,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2549,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The REAL Reasons You Need Twitter For Business","link":"the-real-reasons-you-need-twitter-for-business","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I didn&rsquo;t plan to write a blog about why Twitter for business is so important because as a social media professional, its pretty obvious.</p><p> But as I was gathering research for another  <u>  Twitter marketing </u>  subject to write about, I was blown away at how many brands are either stepping back from executing a consistent Twitter strategy or aren&rsquo;t participating at all.</p><p> The media may rant and rave about how  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/17/twitter-university-endowment-funds-dump-stock\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter is fading  </a> </u>  because it doesn&rsquo;t have a CEO or because it&rsquo;s not making money, but none of those things make it any less of a social network. Its still at the top, and I predict it will only continue to grow.</p><p> My sole aim with writing any article about social media is to help business owners connect with their target audience and speak their language.</p><p> But its also my job to educate people on why they need to invest in social media or a particular social network.</p><p> And Twitter is no different. I believe the majority of all business industries can greatly benefit from Twitters community.</p><p> So why should YOU invest in Twitter?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s my REAL reasons and the benefits of twitter for business.</p><h3> 1. Establish relationships without the clutter</h3><p> <br/> Twitter is pretty basic.</p><p> In fact, I think its so basic, that it can be complicated. It&rsquo;s no Instagram basic, but when it comes down to it, tweeters are simply swapping out messages, conducting conversations, and finding relevant news. Users aren&rsquo;t constantly distracted with hourly updates on food and family, and the barrage of photos.</p><p> And because Twitter hasn&rsquo;t given into ads as much as Facebook, there&rsquo;s a LOT less clutter to bypass to connect with your target audience.</p><p> For my agency&rsquo;s clients, we know exactly who our target audience is and what they are interested in. This allows us to find them on Twitter and quickly begin developing relationships.</p><p> Folks who find Twitter for business to be difficult typically aren&rsquo;t familiar with the nitty gritty of WHO they are trying to reach, so wading out into the vast pool of Twitter is daunting.</p><p> However, when you know who your target audience is, finding them is a lot easier. If you aren&rsquo;t sure how to take those steps to follow and gain followers from your target audience, check out this other article I wrote on  <u>  how to get more Twitter followers </u> .</p><p> Twitter has been the #1 referral tool for my business from day one thanks to the community I developed. It didn&rsquo;t happen overnight and it wasn&rsquo;t easy because it requires commitment, but the value it offers in relationship-building is indisputable.</p><h3> 2. Customer service</h3><p> <br/> One of the best reasons to maintain an active Twitter account for most businesses these days is that social media networks have become the new way for customers to deal with issues and get assistance with problems.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t investing in Twitter, your business will not only miss out on straightforward relationship development with customers and potential customers, but also the opportunity to offer them excellent customer service that other businesses aren&rsquo;t offering.</p><p> These days, when I have a problem, I jump on Twitter or Facebook. A few weeks ago, Skype overcharged me on a phone bill. I went directly online looking for their Twitter or Facebook account, and found they aren&rsquo;t active on Twitter AT ALL and the Facebook page doesn&rsquo;t allow comments, so I couldn&rsquo;t let them know I needed help.</p><p> Further, when I went to the website there was no way to contact them &ndash; the Help forum was my ONLY option.</p><p> Talk about frustrated. So frustrated &ndash; I canceled my account.</p><p> Businesses that aren&rsquo;t actively invested in making sure customer service is a simple process will lose customers.</p><p> PLUS, businesses can cut back on costs by having a social media professional handle customer issues versus investing in call operators or a heavy customer service department.</p><p> For our clients, we take care of most customer service issues and only elevate the major issues, which frees up the time of the business employees and streamlines the process.</p><h3> 3. Establish credibility</h3><p> <br/> If my story in the previous point didn&rsquo;t strike home the need for Twitter for business to establish credibility, then I don&rsquo;t know what will.</p><p> As a customer, why would you have confidence or trust in a company who isn&rsquo;t easy to contact or isn&rsquo;t relevant on social media?</p><p> For my agency clients, we use Twitter to help our B-2-B customers establish credibility with other businesses they want to work with by following them, promoting their content, and establishing relationships. It lets them know the client is relevant and easy to contact if there are any issues.</p><p> Talk about establishing credibility!</p><h3> 4. Connected with Periscope</h3><p> <br/> With the advent of live streaming and Periscope, Twitter has been placed in a whole new arena, and although it hasn&rsquo;t figured out how to monetize itself correctly &ndash; it will.</p><p> Periscope has already proven to be a valuable tool and community for growing my personal and professional brand, and the ease in which it connects with Twitter is part of that awesomeness.</p><p> You can expect Twitter to begin capitalizing on this new social network and make it super easy for users to combine the newest social network with its older brother. Make sure you  <u>  learn how to use Periscope </u>  for your business.</p><h3> 5. Drive traffic</h3><p> <br/> Another major reason for investing in Twitter is that is can drive MAJOR traffic to your website.</p><p> Twitter is typically the #1 social traffic source for our clients, and it doesn&rsquo;t take an enormous amount of effort.</p><p> Yes, you must consistently create new native content to share on Twitter, and yes, you must be sure to promote yourself clearly, but Twitter will streamline that traffic without issue.</p><p> Its not like Facebook who continues to become more and more possessive about keeping its users ON Facebook. Twitter isn&rsquo;t jealous and doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm us with ads &ndash; it allows businesses to easily push followers through to a website.</p><p> And with its recent 2015 updates of video and photos, its even easier to drive traffic wherever you want it to go.</p><h3> 6. Its growing</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;d argue with anyone about Twitters growth because I&rsquo;m there everyday.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me what financial pundits and irritated marketers say about the downfall of Twitter, I&rsquo;m confident its growing.</p><p> As long as Twitter continues to improve the interaction process (as they did with videos/images) and establish smart partnerships (ex. Periscope and Vine), I&rsquo;m all for it.</p><p> But even without the growth of the network, it doesn&rsquo;t negate all the other reasons listed here.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been an active Twitter user since 2009, and can&rsquo;t even begin to communicate all the success stories and golden relationships that the network has provided over the years for clients and myself.</p><p> If your business isn&rsquo;t investing in Twitter then it time to rethink your strategy because you&rsquo;re missing out on MAJOR value for your business.</p><p> So do you see the benefits of Twitter for business, agree/disagree?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 18:59:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 18:59:07.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_z7UIvuu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-real-reasons-you-need-twitter-for-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5737\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 18:59:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 18:59:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-real-reasons-you-need-twitter-for-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5736\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2610\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/twitter-for-business.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"354\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440782100,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}

However, in some cases, a small sample of people will tell you everything you need to know.</p><p> The key to learning is uniformity of response. If you find that after talking to 5, 7 or 20 people, your hypothesis has completely crumbled, then quit it. It&rsquo;s a loser. Talking to more people will only give you more of the same. By the same logic, if your hypothesis lines up perfectly with what 5, 7, or 20 people are sayin&rsquo;, then stick with it. You&rsquo;ve touched a nerve.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;re not looking to optimize anything </strong>  &mdash; Initial customer research is about big, wide-open discovery questions. You&rsquo;re going in with a few assumptions that you can test. You should be able to adjust those assumptions with very little delay. In fact, you should be able to willingly drop whatever you thought you knew, without feeling betrayed. Worrying about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/search?q=customer+learning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   minor details  </a> </u>  at this point will slow you down and muddy the research waters.</p><p> <strong>  Your customer avatar is a stick figure  </strong> &mdash; When you have nothing more than an idea, you have nothing more than potential customers. Don&rsquo;t be in a rush to categorize them. Their pain points will surface as you learn. In time, your avatar will resemble a walking, talking human. You&rsquo;d be surprised by how many entrepreneurs let their biases about who their potential customers are override clear, staring-you-in-the-face evidence.</p><p> <strong>  Customers are strange birds </strong></p><p> A small warning about customers. They suck. Just kidding! But Eric Reis does say that &ldquo;customers can only tell you what <a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/search?q=customer+learning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   they think they want  </u> </a>  and tend to have a very near-term perspective. If you just build what they tell you, you generally wind up with a giant, incoherent mess.&rdquo;</p><p> That means, it&rsquo;s doubtful that your ideal customer is thinking about future trends and market considerations when they share their thoughts with you. Building empathy around customers is a carnival ride of discovery (&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; ) and confusion (&ldquo;What? That makes ZERO sense!&rdquo;). You have to read the tea leaves and piece together what they&rsquo;re really trying to say.</p><p> Now would be a good time to say this: the customer research phase should be a blast. Seriously! Learning about your customers and the market they represent will flood your brain with a gaggle of new ideas, hard questions and everything in-between. If it begins to feel sterile or predictable, you&rsquo;re either doing it wrong, or your assumptions are crapola. Stop and reboot. Come back to it later. Customer research is too important to gloss over.</p><p> Now let&rsquo;s walk through what you&rsquo;re trying to figure out during the customer research process.</p><p> <strong>  Customer Discovery  </strong> &mdash; The most common tactics for learning about customers are what you would expect: personal conversations, demographic research and reverse engineering your competitors. There are probably other tactics that would work fine &mdash; phone tapping, email hacking, dumpster diving &mdash; use your judgement.</p><p> Record everything and compare notes with your team. If you&rsquo;re doing in-person interviews, it&rsquo;s helpful to have another person (or three) present to pick up on little important things like body language, tone and passion. Especially look for passion. Remember to act cheerful and friendly through the whole interview. That way, nobody resists your nosy and intrusive questions.</p><p> <strong>  Helpful Questions to Test: </strong></p><li> What are these customers doing now to work around the problem you see?</li><li> How do they describe their present situation?</li><li> What kind of emotion do they show regarding the problem? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Useful Tools: </strong></p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newhaircut.com/#!/process/learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Empathy Map  </a> </u></li><li> Customer Persona Sketch</li><li> Storyboard <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The Value Proposition </strong>  &mdash; Charles Kettering  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/charles_kettering.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   said it well  </a> </u> : &ldquo;A problem well-defined is a problem half-solved.&rdquo; Articulating the problem you solve for in plain language is something many entrepreneurs struggle with. In the early stages of customer learning, you&rsquo;re still a long way from a fully formed value proposition. But as you learn about potential customers, you&rsquo;ll begin to see different propositions take shape. Hold on to all of them for safekeeping. Some of em&rsquo; might be worth refining.</p><p> As you think ahead to the value you might be able to create, avoid tipping your hand with interview subjects. You are not looking for &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers. Ask open-ended questions. Keep your instincts in check too, as you read through trade publications, industry newsletters and competitor&rsquo;s marketing collateral. You are looking for gaps in service that might show an opening in the market (i.e. white space). You can penetrate even saturated markets, provided you can show value.</p><p> <strong>  Helpful Questions to Test: </strong></p><li> What assumptions do customers have about the problem?</li><li> What expectations do customers have about products in this market?</li><li> What have they been exposed to already?</li><li> What problem is the most urgent? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Useful tools: </strong></p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newhaircut.com/#!/process/learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Value Proposition Canvas  </a> </u></li><li> Customer Journey Map <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The Business Model  </strong> &mdash; According to  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40pmarca&amp;src=typd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marc Andreessen  </a> </u> , the #1 company-killer is lack of market. He believes a good market can overcome a mediocre team and product. Given the high rate of failure among startups, it&rsquo;s safe to say that many entrepreneurs skimp on the initial customer learning process.

You&rsquo;re looking at the size of the market (number of consumers, spending habits) and fitting that into your calculations. Common VC advice is blunt: go after a BIG market! The more crowded &mdash; it&rsquo;s thought &mdash; the better. Conversely, any market that&rsquo;s easy to dominate won&rsquo;t stay that way for long.</p><p> <strong>  Helpful Questions to Test: </strong></p><li> How big is the market for your assumptions?</li><li> Are customers in that market paying for a solution?</li><li> Can those customers afford to pay for a solution (i.e. no  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.getdigsy.com/blog/startups/fun-ways-kill-startup/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   starving musicians  </a> </u> )?</li><li> Who are the biggest players in the market?</li><li> How fragmented is the market? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Useful tools: </strong></p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newhaircut.com/#!/process/learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Business Model Canvas  </a> </u></li><li> Needs Analysis <br/>  </li><p> In corporations and late-stage startups, you hardly ever hear about initial customer research.

Yes, the learning process  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.groovehq.com/blog/customer-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   never stops  </a> </u>  and must constantly be incorporated into your product.

{"original_id":2551,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to be Like the 5 Best CEOs in the World","link":"how-to-be-like-the-5-best-ceos-in-the-world","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Are you one of the best CEOs in the United States?  <a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/Highest-Rated-CEOs-LST_KQ0,18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Glassdoor  </u>    </a> will be able to tell you. They&rsquo;ve announced the winners of its annual Employees&rsquo; Choice Awards for the Highest Rated CEOs in 2015. On the list of top-rated leaders who oversee at least 1,000 employees, there are companies you might have guessed, like Google and Apple. But being a household name isn&rsquo;t enough to make a workforce approve of their senior leadership.</p><p> So what are the leadership qualities that put a CEO on this list? Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the employees themselves have to say about the top five highest-rated leaders.</p><p> 1.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   Larry Page, Google  </a> </u> : <strong>  97% Approval </strong></p><p> Making yourself accessible:  \"The company is amazingly open,\" one employee writes, describing the \"TGIF\" weekly forum that Page hosts. \"It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.\" Even an enormously successful company like Google can make the time for leadership to keep employees in the know. The investment of time is relatively minor, but the impact on employee morale is huge.</p><p> Having a meaningful mission:  &ldquo;You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world.\" As this employee points out, the success and prestige of Google aren&rsquo;t what makes workers happy. Page&rsquo;s vision gives employees the ability to do work that matters to them.</p><p> 2.  <u>  Mark G. Parker, Nike </u> : <strong>  97% Approval </strong></p><p> Creating connections:  Even a company with thousands of employees can provide meaningful interactions between leaders and the rest of the workforce. &ldquo;Exposure to upper management,&rdquo; is what one employee cites as a high point of working there. &ldquo;[E]veryone is willing to take time to network and meet you.&rdquo; While Parker himself surely doesn&rsquo;t speak individually to every member of his workforce, it&rsquo;s vital that he creates a culture where employees feel welcome to connect with senior leaders. What&rsquo;s more, encouraging the formation of these connections helps strengthen the workforce by fostering professional development.</p><p> Inspiring:  Great leaders light a spark in their employees, both directly and by putting together a team of inspiring people. One Nike employee says, &ldquo;The people are incredibly inspiring, creative, and innovative. It is a company full of leaders with hard-working, passionate, dedicated employees who want to help better the world through sport.&rdquo; Strong leaders can&rsquo;t just look at themselves and their own passions; they have to think about how they will inspire everyone else&rsquo;s too.</p><p> 3.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.heb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Charles C. Butt, H E B  </a> </u> : <strong>  96% Approval </strong></p><p> Fostering development:  The opportunity for professional growth is commonly cited by employees as one of the most important factors in their job. So it&rsquo;s no surprise that a successful CEO must make this a priority. According to an H E B employee, &ldquo;[T]hey love to promote from within and have great tools to help teach you the skills you need to succeed.&rdquo; By investing in developing their existing employees, H E B motivates them to stick around.</p><p> Having a human touch:  When your company has thousands of employees, it&rsquo;s extra-important to treat them as people, not cogs in the machine. H E B succeeds at that, according to this employee: &ldquo;The top priority of the company is to give not only the customers a great shopping experience but to make the employees feel like they are part of a family rather than just a worker.&rdquo; That kind of genuine connection will drive employees to dig deeper and push farther in order to support one another.</p><p> 4.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook  </a> </u> : <strong>  95% Approval </strong></p><p> Being transparent:  &ldquo;It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is,&rdquo; an employee says, &ldquo;but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at.&rdquo; The reason this is so vital to leadership is that transparency isn&rsquo;t just some fluffy notion to keep employees happy &mdash; leaders who embrace it get better results. &ldquo;I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect,&rdquo; the same employee writes.</p><p> Making an impact:  There&rsquo;s no denying Facebook&rsquo;s ubiquitous presence in our lives. As one worker puts it, &ldquo;Anything you do affects up to a billion people!&rdquo; And Zuckerberg&rsquo;s vast reach makes working for him more rewarding for his workforce. One employee shared their story, &ldquo;Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change [a] very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I [checked in] my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better [about] my job.&rdquo;</p><p> 5. Scott Scherr,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ultimatesoftware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ultimate Software  </a> </u> : <strong>  95% Approval </strong></p><p> Providing recognition:  No matter how good the job or successful the company, an employee who isn&rsquo;t recognized for their efforts won&rsquo;t be happy on the job. One employee writes, &ldquo;We feel appreciated at work&rdquo; &mdash; and most importantly &mdash; &ldquo;which comes from the top down.&rdquo; Though he doesn&rsquo;t see each individual&rsquo;s contributions, it&rsquo;s up to Scherr to create the culture that fosters employee recognition. The same employee describes how the process works, &ldquo;Scott, our CEO, is an amazing leader who actually cares about everyone in his organization. That trickles down to his leaders, who give us commendation for a job well done.&rdquo;</p><p> Being generous:  While many of the qualities listed above are lofty ideals, we can&rsquo;t forget that a job is about making a living. Even the most engaged employee will struggle if they can&rsquo;t provide for themselves and their families. Several reviews of Scherr mention his whole-package compensation, from competitive salaries to employer-paid insurance premiums to perks like on-site massage services and dry cleaning. These extensive benefits combine to make employees feel that the company, in their words, &ldquo;really does put its people first.&rdquo;</p><p> The CEOs on this list, as well as the rest of Glassdoor&rsquo;s award winners, are certainly a variety of personalities working in a variety of industries. But they share a common thread of genuine and respectful treatment of their employees. And that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s achievable by companies of any size.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 19:18:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 19:18:19.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_bPjADch.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-be-like-the-5-best-ceos-in-the-world/\", \"post_id\": \"5741\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 19:18:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 19:18:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-be-like-the-5-best-ceos-in-the-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5740\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2612\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/thumb_13978984b1266d8f5f1dae4215ab9ed62eda26c8_header_image_header.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"484\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440796500,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2552,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Union Mentality: A Culture of Mediocrity","link":"union-mentality-a-culture-of-mediocrity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Excuse me for my title. I&rsquo;m sure it will offend at least one person, but I am not concerned because those of us who have worked in unionized environments know the deal. There is an aura, a way and even a stench that permeates from union environments. Although collective bargaining agreements vary from union to union most of them get manipulated and stretched into rainbow area where very few performance issues matter and being terminated is damn near impossible.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I appreciate the intention of the labor movement. Thinking about the 146 people that died tragically in the 1911  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121379/triangle-factory-fire-reminds-us-why-unions-are-essential\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Triangle Shirtwaist Fire  </a> </u>  in Greenwich Village, NY still gives me chills. What I question is how the labor movement evolved from one that protects worker&rsquo;s rights and safety on job; to aiding and abetting a culture of mediocrity in the organizations they serve. There are some really good people who are union members. However, there are just as many others who have a sense of entitlement and saunter through their careers hanging on the every word of their changing bargaining agreements and giving their employers hell every step of the way.</p><h3> Fearing the Union</h3><p> <br/> The true travesty in all of this is the reluctance on the part of the employer to manage their union workforce accordingly. In the organizations, I have worked for management was fearful of the union- especially the bigger unions. It is not only a mistake to fear the unions in your organization- it completely undermines the efforts of your non-union employees who have to wake up to a culture of mediocrity on one side of the house and a culture of excellence where they sit.</p><p> When I worked in healthcare, I was responsible for dealing with one of the largest unions in NY. The practitioners and professionals that were a part of this union barely got a cent worth of their dues. Why you ask? The organization feared the union. Employees that were poor performers were not written up and progressively disciplined. Instead, line managers opted to forego progressive discipline and let the poor performer be, because members of this union couldn&rsquo;t transfer for one year once written up.</p><p> This caused the organization to retain an inordinate number of people who were being shuffled around the organization by seniority bids, because management had decided it was easier to pass the problems around to their peers. Too often, I would have to deliver the news to both new and tenured managers that they were receiving Jane or John Doe from this unit for their position &ndash; to which I would get: &ldquo;I am going to fight this I know this person&rsquo;s performance and I don&rsquo;t want them working here.&rdquo; I used to say: &ldquo;Rock on Baby Bubba!&rdquo; I completely understood and felt their pain.</p><h3> Union Mafia what?</h3><p> <br/> In time, I too became disgusted with the culture of mediocrity that was brewing in this organization. I questioned how we could be dedicated to superior patient care when our bench strength in our union facilities was poor? To make matters worse, quite a few Labor Relations Managers in HR became crooks themselves working with union delegates to move people into positions they didn&rsquo;t deserve.</p><p> While I recognize that this reality may not be yours, it is the reality of labor in the past 10 years. I know because I have vetted my experience with other HR professionals and leaders that have dealt with unions. If this sounds like your company, I sympathize with you. The key point here is: whether you are union or not the organizational goal should be the same. There can&rsquo;t be one group working hard because they know their jobs depend on it- while the other side of house is milking the vague and nuanced language of their collective bargaining agreements to do the least. This approach not only undermines the initial intention of the labor movement, but it disgraces it.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 19:30:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 19:30:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_6oBarez.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/union-mentality-a-culture-of-mediocrity/\", \"post_id\": \"5743\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 19:30:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 19:30:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"union-mentality-a-culture-of-mediocrity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5742\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2613\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440190727617-48b9b2c7e24b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1853\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440781200,"author_id":212,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2553,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Power of an Enemy","link":"the-power-of-an-enemy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m an extremely competitive person. As a kid in sports, I played my heart out, hated my opponents and cried when I lost. Admonished by my mother and father for unsportsmanlike behavior, I eventually matured and forged a stiff upper lip in defeat. But behind the fa&ccedil;ade, the agony gnawed my gut &ndash; it still does. I have no regrets; In fact, I consider the repugnance of losing a special gift. There is no doubt in my mind that my ferocious competitive spirit is responsible for my success in corporate life.</p><h3> The late French author Andre Maurois once said, &ldquo;Business is a combination of sport and war.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Maurois was alluding to the notion that those engaged in war, hate the enemy. In business, your competitor is the enemy. For most of my career, I operated within intensely competitive arenas where fractions of market share points were worth millions of dollars. The companies that employed me were generally the underdogs in battles against bigger, better-financed organizations. Against mounting odds, we did more than survive. We thrived.</p><p> Competitive situations create a distinct individual and team behavior. From my experience, these six characteristics encapsulate the competitive business culture. If these environments stir your senses, then you and I are kindred spirits.</p><h3> 1. Always have a sense of urgency.  </h3><p> This is a tremendous competitive advantage for the smaller player. In the race to the future, there will be drivers, passengers and road-kill. Nimbleness will get your ideas to the future first.</p><h3> 2. Clearly define your goals. </h3><p> Like a sports scorecard, competitive spirit demands measurement and accountability of performance. Your success or failure can be quantified by such measurements as market share, financial ratios, brand awareness, new products and deadlines.</p><h3> 3. Live a culture of innovation.  </h3><p> Nobody wants to compete in a financial spitting contest. You cannot outspend the giant competitor. You must outsmart them with entrepreneurial thinking.</p><h3> 4. Never rest on your laurels.  </h3><p> Even when you pull ahead, run up the score. Why? Because you never give the enemy a break. Increase your lead, and while they are catching up, you are embracing the next innovation.</p><h3> 5. Know the enemy.  </h3><p> Go ahead, hate your competitors. But don&rsquo;t be so obsessed with them that you allow yourself to be drawn into an emotional price war. Winning at any cost is a signal that you have lost sense of the business objectives. All you have to do is make them think you will compete at any cost.</p><h3> 6. Focus on the things that matter. </h3><p> By concentrating on proactive projects within your control, you can force the enemy to follow you. Now, isn&rsquo;t that a lot more fun than being on the defensive?</p><p> Years ago, I worked on Pillsbury&rsquo;s Refrigerated Fresh Dough advertising as a Leo Burnett Account Executive. Pillsbury pioneered this category with proprietary technology and had no direct competition. With 100% share of market, our strategy was market growth and we managed to double sales in four years. Sounds impressive, but quite honestly we did not push ourselves. I think we could have done better with a competitor nipping at our heels.</p><p> The risk of market dominance is complacency &ndash; companies get used to environments devoid of intense competition. Look at Research in Motion. Years ago, RIM&rsquo;s BlackBerry was synonymous with smartphones. Then along came Apple and Google with mobile phones that delivered superior benefits. Today, RIM struggles to maintain 5% of the market. This is a stunning fall from grace considering RIM pioneered push email with devices that were considered so indispensable, they were nicknamed the Crack-Berry. It&rsquo;s not as if RIM were operating in a non-competitive environment. They either didn&rsquo;t know it or had no idea how to deal with it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 19:30:37.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 19:30:37.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ILnnbPs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-power-of-an-enemy/\", \"post_id\": \"5745\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 19:30:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 19:30:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-power-of-an-enemy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5744\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2614\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-27-at-12.33.06-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"516\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440778200,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}

Should B2Bs be Jumping into Live Video?","link":"eyeballs-in-the-stream-should-b2bs-be-jumping-into-live-video","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Video livestreaming services have been around for a while. But with new apps such as Periscope and Meerkat now bringing the technology centre stage, many B2B businesses will be considering whether to start using this as another way of connecting with target audiences.</p><p> But is livestreaming suitable, or indeed worthwhile? Writing for Business.com recently, content manager Shayna Marks suggests that brands should be wary of getting carried away by all the hype.</p><p> As the article notes, on paper livestreaming sounds like a marketer's dream, providing the opportunity to talk face-to-face (near enough), and in real time, about your business, product or service to an enthusiastic target audience.</p><p> For B2B businesses, there are a number of obvious ways that this technology can be applied, especially for streaming conferences and major company events. Some have even suggested the new technology could ultimately replace the entire concept of webinars.</p><p> Before the likes of Periscope and Meerkat, companies wishing to leverage livestreaming had to deploy some pretty sophisticated technology as well as needing access to high technical skill levels and a chunky budget. This was enough to put it out of reach for most businesses.</p><p> So if the two apps have now lowered the barriers to entry, surely that can only be a good thing? Perhaps.  But only if the ultimate viewership numbers are worth all the effort...which, as things stand, they may not be.</p><p> According to Nuvi figures reported by AdWeek, for example, Periscope users shared livestream content just over 1.5 million times on Twitter from March to May this year. Meerkat's numbers on Twitter seem to have been pretty similar during that period.</p><p> While these figures may sound quite reasonable for what are, after all, only recently-launched platforms, marketers should be far more interested in viewing figures than streaming volumes. Even if the average stream had an average of 100 simultaneous viewers (which Marks says is very generous, seeing as most she's seen struggle to muster more than about 25), that only amounts to some 151 million views over a three-month period. So less than 2 million a day.</p><p> Compare this to the activity seen on other networks and you'd be forgiven for thinking it's not even worth getting out of bed for. Facebook, for example, has around 750 million daily active users on mobile alone, while there are more than 70 million images posted to Instagram every day.</p><p> Of course, it usually takes a while for any new technology or platform to catch on, so it would be a mistake to rush to any firm conclusions. I, for one, certainly wouldn't rule out live streaming technology being right at the forefront of social media marketing a few years from now.</p><p> But what approach should B2Bs be taking on video streaming in the here and now? My advice to clients is that there's no need to rush into it. They should take plenty of time to explore and experiment with the channel - seeing where the ROI possibilities lie - before leaping into any major investment.</p><p> The fact is that, with livestreaming still in its infancy, there's every chance that another killer platform could emerge in the next year or two. Facebook would be the most obvious candidate -  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/05/facescope/#.jiarvn:m2d0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in fact they launched a 'celebrity-only video streaming service earlier this month  </a> </u>  and it would be surprising if a mass market product wasn't already on their radar, which could blow the likes of Persicope and Meerkat out of the water.</p><p> In a nutshell, I feel confident in saying that livestreaming has a huge role in the future of social media marketing...but zero confidence in predicting which will be the dominant platform 10, 5, even 3 years from now.</p><p> So DO keep your options open and be prepared for livestreaming to become an integral part of your long term social media strategy. But DON'T bet the farm by committing to a single platform - at least until there's more maturity in the technology and some of the big players like Facebook have showed their hand.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 19:46:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 19:46:44.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_b1oDmhC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/eyeballs-in-the-stream-should-b2bs-be-jumping-into-live-video/\", \"post_id\": \"5747\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 19:46:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 19:46:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"eyeballs-in-the-stream-should-b2bs-be-jumping-into-live-video\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5746\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2615\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-27-at-12.49.11-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"688\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440789300,"author_id":492,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;ve been involved with them since they first launched in 2010, and have really enjoyed watching the organization grow over the last few years.</p><p> The camp I attended was labeled as a surf camp, hosted at Oakley Headquarters, but in reality was for more than that. The camp was actually a leadership course, the likes of which I hadn&rsquo;t seen since my time at West Point. It was a truly refreshing approach, and went well beyond veterans affairs.</p><br /><br /><p> I&rsquo;m self employed and don&rsquo;t have many worker bees below me, so sometimes its easy to forget that we can serve as leaders in many different ways. Sure, in group situations typically I&rsquo;m the type of person who takes control a bit to get decisions made and things moving.</p><p> But what impressed me about the Team RWB camp was their vision.</p><p> They that feel we, the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, can become the next Great Generation. We all know that serving in the military is a unique experience and typically most leave their time in service with a certain ethos that they may not have otherwise developed. Team RWB wants to capitalize on that and encourage our veterans to be leaders in all aspects of our communities. Wherever it is that one feels they can be of service.</p><p> The bottomline is that most people feel our country is lacking leadership at all levels. We see it in the news everyday, and it was a little depressing for me to come back to America after 11 years living abroad to see, what many feel, is our country close to chaos. I won&rsquo;t get into the politics of it all though, as right or left, I don&rsquo;t believe anyone is happy right now.</p><p> So how do we fix this? Is it fixable at all? Team RWB thinks it is, and they encouraged me to take action.</p><br /><br /><p> Our veterans will need to step up in the coming years to help turn things around.</p><p> So&hellip; that&rsquo;s me, I need to step up. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve created this community within the context of financial planning. As a financial advisor, I strive to be a leader &ndash; not only for my clients, but also to advocate the importance of building a &ldquo;wholistic&rdquo; financial plan. We&rsquo;re lucky to have an organization like Team RWB to remind us of how we can be involved and help ensure our country is on the right track.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, I encourage you to visit the  <u>  <a href=\"http://teamrwb.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Team RWB website  </a> </u>  and sign up. There is no cost or obligation whatsoever.

{"original_id":2556,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Using Reward and Affirmation to Influence","link":"using-reward-and-affirmation-to-influence","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How do you know you are successfully leading and influencing others?</p><li> Your influence causes people in a group to work as one in order to achieve common goals.</li><li> Your influence inspires and motivates followers to become better.</li><li> Your influence instills a sense of followership in members of a group. <br/>  </li><p> One key way to accomplish this is through appreciating others on the team through rewards and affirmation.</p><p> Yet this is hugely lacking in today&rsquo;s business culture. A recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/13888/best-ways-recognize-employees.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup Poll  </a> </u>  found that almost two out of three people receive no workplace recognition in a given year.</p><p> This underscores a recent finding from the U.S. Department of Labor that the number one reason people leave their jobs is because they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t feel appreciated.&rdquo;</p><h3> The Difference Between Reward and Recognition</h3><p> <br/> Reward and affirmation are not the same. Webster defines a reward as something given for a worthy behavior or performance. These are tangible and may be in the form of a raise, stock options, profit sharing, extra vacation time, travel packages and bonuses.</p><p> Affirmation, on the other hand, is a favorable notice of an achievement done by an individual or group.</p><p> Both are necessary to keep morale high. A team member who is continually told they are doing a great job but never sees a raise or other tangible reward will soon believe they are being treated unfairly. On the other hand, money alone is not enough of an internal motivation to keep someone in a culture that lacks gratitude and appreciation.</p><h3> The Eight Reasons Why People Do What They Do and Examples of Affirmations for Each</h3><p> <br/> Psychologist Bobb Biehl points to eight reasons why people do what they do. These are to feel:</p><li> Loved: to be unconditionally loved and received (ex. honest heart-felt authentic appreciation)</li><li> Significant: to make a difference and bring transformation whether or not you ever receive credit (ex. changing the health of a company)</li><li> Admired: to have others aspire to be like you in some regard (ex. to have team members who desire to be mentored by you)</li><li> Recognized: to be publicly applauded and recognized by name (ex. to be awarded at a banquet or meeting)</li><li> Appreciated: to be thanked verbally or in writing, privately is fine (ex. to be verbally told or given a handwritten note saying thank you)</li><li> Secure: to have some semblance of control and protection (ex. to have a stable position and paycheck)</li><li> Respected: to be asked for input because you are perceived as valuable and wise (ex. asked to be on a committee or board)</li><li> Accepted: to belong socially to the team or community (ex. invited and not left out on informal staff lunch outing) <br/>  </li><p> Typically, someone has a dominant form of affirmation with some secondary forms present. Affirming the individual through multiple meaning channels can be a powerful esteem builder.</p><h3> Catch and Affirm Someone Doing It Right to Encourage Repeated Behavior </h3><p> <br/> When a great action, teamwork, or an attitude is appreciated, it provides positive reinforcement, thus strengthening the particular behavior. When the colleague or employee is recognized for her efforts, the team member will be much more likely to go the extra mile to meet her superior&rsquo;s expectations.  Emotional buy-in is created when she feels that she will always be appreciated and rewarded. Thus, the likelihood of that team member and all team members doing their tasks well will increase.</p><h3> Rewarding and Affirming Lead to Increased Self-Esteem and Productivity</h3><p> <br/> Rewards and appreciation also boost the employee&rsquo;s self-esteem. He feels that the company thinks of him as an asset to the organization. When team members feel that they have contributed to a positive outcome within the business, they will feel good about themselves and will enjoy their job more. A happy team member is more productive than someone who is disgruntled or apathetic.</p><h3> Individualization is Key</h3><p> <br/> In order for recognition to be meaningful, it must be tailored to the recipient&rsquo;s preferences, not the giver&rsquo;s preferences. If you as a leader prefer to receive affirmation from being recognized, don&rsquo;t assume this is how all your team members prefer to receive affirmation. In fact, some people strongly dislike to be publicly awarded.</p><p> You must take the time to know what motivates each team member.</p><p> Here are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/13888/best-ways-recognize-employees.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   affirmation-understanding questions  </a> </u>  Gallup suggests to ask:</p><li> What is the greatest recognition you have ever received?</li><li> What are your &ldquo;hot buttons&rdquo; &mdash; hobbies or interests you like to talk about?</li><li> What increases your positive emotion or &ldquo;fills your bucket&rdquo; the most?</li><li> From whom do you most like to receive recognition or praise?</li><li> What type of recognition, or praise do you like best? Do you like public, private, written, verbal, or other kinds of recognition?</li><li> What form of recognition motivates you the most? Do you like gift certificates, a title for winning a competition, a meaningful note or e-mail, or something else? <br/>  </li><h3> Give Specific Affirmation Tied to a Task</h3><p> <br/> A generic &ldquo;good job&rdquo; means little in terms of creating repeated behaviors. Telling a team member, &ldquo;I really appreciate the extra time you spent on that report,&rdquo; has much more meaning. Be sure to include why you appreciate them. &ldquo;The extra time you spent providing details about projected income allowed me to get our budgeted expenses pushed through the committee.&rdquo;  Every report you get from that team member in the future will be apt to have extra effort put into its creation. When team members can tie their activity to how and why it helps the organization, morale rises.</p><h3> Give General Affirmation Tied to Their Character and Growing Leadership</h3><p> <br/> While a majority of affirmation should be tied to direct actions and accomplishments, it IS important to celebrate the whole person. Set aside time to have a conversation where you affirm team members in an individual way. Of course, sincerity is vital. We tend to know ourselves and can easily recognize when a leader is using false flattery.</p><p> Here are some general affirmations:</p><li> Leadership comes naturally to you.</li><li> You have superior managerial skills.</li><li> You take charge easily no matter what the situation.</li><li> People often look to you for advice.</li><li> You embrace responsibility.</li><li> You initiate projects without me asking.</li><li> You work diligently with minimal supervision.</li><li> You are honest and candid.</li><li> You bring a sense of peace when there is chaos.</li><li> You accept new challenges.</li><li> You have great interpersonal skills.</li><li> You make things happen.</li><li> You draw out the best in others.</li><li> You are an encourager. <br/>  </li><h3> What Can Happen When We Don&rsquo;t Affirm</h3><p> <br/> The absence of giving rewards and affirmation to team members who have performed and behaved well in the company will have negative effects. Team members will begin to underperform. They will feel that there is no reason to exert extra effort in performing tasks. They will be more likely to take unwarranted breaks, mindlessly surf the web, arrive at work late or ignore rules. These negative effects may bleed over into colleagues. A team member may complain, spreading negative energy and pass blame to others. In the final act, a team member who feels unrewarded and under-affirmed will opt to leave the organization.</p><p> Giving rewards and affirmation to worthy team members is an ongoing activity of a great leader. Great leaders create great team members, and rewarded and affirmed team members make a leader great.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 19:58:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 19:58:54.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_9VrzlQN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/using-reward-and-affirmation-to-influence/\", \"post_id\": \"5751\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 19:58:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 19:58:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"using-reward-and-affirmation-to-influence\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5750\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2617\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440151050977-247552660a3b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"846\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440762300,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

Korger  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.independenceadvisors.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Independence Advisors  </u> </a></p><h3> Key Takeaways <br/>  </h3><li> Annuities are designed to provide tax-deferred growth by taking dollars that you would have otherwise invested and placing them within an &ldquo;insurance wrapper.&rdquo;</li><li> Annuity payouts can be immediate or deferred, with the deferred option being either fixed or variable.</li><li> Before taking the annuity plunge, make sure you have exhausted all other pre-tax retirement plans and have a long-term time view. Also your tax bracket should be high, so the annuity&rsquo;s tax deferral benefit is worth its higher cost. <br/>  </li><p> When I mention the word &ldquo;annuity&rdquo; to clients I&rsquo;m often met with looks of confusion. To some, an annuity implies a monthly check they receive year-in and year-out from their insurance company. To others, it could mean a tax-deferred investment that is never turned into a stream of income.  The key to understanding annuities is recognizing that they come in all shapes, colors and sizes &ndash; some good and some not so good.</p><p> Webster&rsquo;s dictionary defines an annuity as follows:</p><li>  fixed amount of money that is paid to the recipient each year.</li><li> An insurance policy or an investment that pays [the policy holder] a fixed amount of money each year. <br/>  </li><p> It gets confusing because in wealth management, we often refer to this as &ldquo;annuitization,&rdquo; or the income phase of an annuity.  The term annuity can also refer to the  <strong>  investment vehicle used to fund the future payments </strong>  and not just to the future payments themselves. This distinction is important because many annuities are owned purely as tax-deferred investments and they may never be annuitized and turned into streams of payments.</p><p> The basic idea is that by taking dollars that you would have otherwise invested and put them inside an &ldquo;insurance wrapper,&rdquo; the government allows you to achieve tax-deferred growth.  However, it&rsquo;s critical to remember there are  <strong>  always </strong>  additional costs associated with this insurance aspect, referred to as a mortality and expense (M&amp;E) charge.</p><p> <strong>  Immediate vs. deferred annuities </strong></p><p> In a broad sense, annuities fall into one of two categories-- <strong>  &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; </strong> or <strong>  &ldquo;deferred.&rdquo; </strong>   With an immediate annuity, you simply turn over a lump sum of money to an insurance company and in return the insurer promises to pay you a monthly check based on the initial principal for as long as you live.   <br/> <br/> A deferred annuity on the other hand, is typically purchased as a tax-deferral vehicle. You may contribute a lump sum to get started, or in some cases, you pay multiple premiums. However, rather than annuitize the value of the annuity and turn it into a stream of payments, your dollars are invested for long-term tax-deferred growth.</p><p> <strong>  Deferred annuities: Fixed vs. variable  </strong> <br/> <br/> Deferred investments are broken down further into the subcategories of  <strong>  fixed </strong>  and  <strong>  variable annuities </strong> . These terms refer to the type of investment return you can expect with the annuity.   <br/> <br/> A  <strong>  fixed annuity </strong>  provides a set interest rate on your tax-deferred deposit, similar to a bank CD.  <strong>  Variable annuities </strong>  however, give you that same benefit of tax-deferral, but as the name implies, your rate of return varies. Your return becomes a factor of how you choose to invest your annuity among a selection of mutual-fund-like subaccounts.</p><h3> Key considerations</h3><p> <br/> Back in 1999 (I remember the year because of the &ldquo;Y2K&rdquo; craze), I was working in Vanguard&rsquo;s variable annuity marketing department and I spent most of my time discussing the suitability of variable annuities with individuals. There were a few standard questions we asked to determine whether or not a variable annuity was right for a particular individual:</p><li> Have you exhausted all other pre-tax savings opportunities such as retirement plans and IRAs?</li><li> Do you have a long-term time horizon for these assets (at least 10 years)?</li><li> Are you in a high enough tax bracket to make the tax deferral worth the higher costs? <br/>  </li><p> In addition to tax-deferral, one of the most common benefits of an annuity is a perceived &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; of income. It may be a promise to pay you income for the rest of your life, or a promise to pay a minimum death benefit to your heirs, or a guaranteed rate of return on your investment, just to name a few.   <br/> <br/> Just remember the old adage--there is no free lunch. These annuity features are sold on their stated benefits, typically with little emphasis on the annuity&rsquo;s underlying costs. Each of the additional bells and whistles associated with a &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; adds more to the cost of the annuity.  I have seen annuities with annual expenses as high as 4 percent, even 5 percent.  Additionally, any guarantee you receive is only as good as the company providing it to you. And anything can happen &ndash; think Lehman Brothers or Enron &ndash; so nothing is really guaranteed.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Under the right circumstance, annuities can be used as a tax-deferred investment vehicle or to create an income stream for yourself.  They can fit nicely into your comprehensive financial plan provided you are a &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; investor.  However, it&rsquo;s important to look at annuities in the context of your goals and priorities, because they are certainly not right for everyone.  Most importantly, if you are considering purchasing an annuity, understand exactly what the costs are up front so you can make a well-informed decision.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 20:08:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 20:08:01.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_btc5zxl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-annuities-right-for-you-3-important-considerations/\", \"post_id\": \"5753\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 20:08:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 20:08:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-annuities-right-for-you-3-important-considerations\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5752\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2618\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1440337055961-9b6c37c9e88f-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"525\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440774000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2558,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Content with Your Content Marketing Strategy?","link":"are-you-content-with-your-content-marketing-strategy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Content marketing has been buzzed about for years. Business leaders, including savvy marketers and PR practitioners, know that speaking at consumers doesn&rsquo;t get you nearly as far as engaging with them. But finding the best ways to engage can be a struggle. Enter content marketing. From compelling stories, delivered via releases, bylines, blogs or case studies, to visually-appealing infographics, videos, webinars and live presentations, content marketing helps companies emotionally connect with their target audiences. When done correctly, compelling content does a nice job of telling (not selling) the story, even influencing purchasing decisions, all without the traditional sales pitch.</p><p> But how do you know what will work and what could flop? Which of the avenues do you pursue and invest time or money into? Do you develop a great video with hopes customers will find it engaging? And once you do, how do you communicate the existence of such a video? Do you pitch it to media, set it up on your company YouTube channel, website, promote it on social media or all of the above? Even more so, how do you continuously come up with that fresh content and find the right delivery channels?</p><p> There are a few things to consider. First, as with any PR strategy, it&rsquo;s important to identify the purpose, the ultimate goal. What are you trying to accomplish here? Are you looking to elevate your experts, grow market share, launch a new product? Secondly, which of communication tools is right for your business? If you&rsquo;re in the B2B space, your target audience may not be (most likely not) getting news and information from the same channels as consumers. Similarly, if your target audience is thrill-seeking millenials (note: two buzzwords in same blog!), who love to share videos, then your strategy may be different than if you&rsquo;re looking to attract an older demographic, who is interested in the facts about your product and would prefer to join a webinar or read through a case study.</p><p> When planning your strategy, consider your content and delivery method and ensure that any customer touch point clearly and consistently communicates your brand value proposition, regardless of the delivery vehicle. And of course, to stand out from all the other brand feverishly putting out content and truly connect with your target customers, make it compelling. Also, make sure you research what your consumers are doing, what they are reading (and when) and how are they engaging with others, and create a content plan along with a timeline. Similarly to building out your social media content pipeline via a calendar, create a calendar to make sure all the bases are covered and you aren&rsquo;t continuously coming up with content that will be irrelevant to your target audience. It&rsquo;s sometimes better not to say anything, that add confusion to the marketplace. So, be strategic and get creative!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-27 20:23:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-27 20:23:02.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_yCe53jy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-content-with-your-content-marketing-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"5755\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-27 20:23:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-27 20:23:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-content-with-your-content-marketing-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5754\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2619\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/internal-library.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"563\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1440782100,"author_id":38,"chart_url":""}

Since the body always follows the mind, it is of utmost importance for us to focus primarily on our mental diet rather than our physical diet. Changing the diet you feed your mind is how to easily transform your body by completing renewing your mind.</p><p> Positive transformation is always the result of renewal. Renewal is always the result of the spoken or written word. Words have the power to encourage, enlighten, and renew. Words can also depress, defeat, and destroy. My goal in this article is to educate you in order to motivate you to make some changes in your life. The result of those changes will be a change in your feelings and results. </p><p> I do not want you to take action because you feel like it. Rather, I want you to take action because you KNOW that you should because I have have sold you on the benefits. in other words, you will GO because you KNOW. As a result, you will GROW in health, strength, and wellness. You will finally FEEL better, and maybe even look better. In my book \" <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/books/five-f-words-will-energize-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Five F-Words That Will Energize Your Life  </a> </u> \", I call this the THINK-ACT-FEEL process. It is why I am so passionate about helping people know, go, and grow!</p><h3> What Is Health?</h3><p> <br/> What makes a healthy person? To rephrase the question, what makes a person healthy? Is health the absence of illness? Can one be healthy without being physically fit? Does physical fitness translate into good health? Let&rsquo;s explore the answers together.</p><p> Health, defined simply as a state or condition, is relative. But relative to what? Perhaps we need a standard or benchmark based on the science of medicine and the philosophy of naturopathy.</p><h3> Nutrition</h3><p> <br/> I believe our common sense is the diet plan each one of us was given at birth. If only we would follow it with some self control, most of us would be better off.</p><p> Here are a few tips:</p><li> Stop drinking sugar in your coffee and tea, and in thirty days you will never miss it.</li><li> Avoid adding salt to your foods.</li><li> Quit eating as soon as you feel satisfied.</li><p> <br/> Before burnout, my eating habits were awful. I would grab a burger and some fries or a sandwich and eat on the run between service calls. I would seldom stop for a decent lunch. Now I relax for an hour while I am eating a balanced meal. I have found that eating can actually be enjoyable.</p><p> Zig Ziglar asks this question in his seminars, &ldquo;If you had a million dollar race horse, would you keep him up all night drinking coffee and alcohol and smoking cigarettes and expect him to race the next day?\" What about a ten dollar dog or a five dollar cat? Well, then, why do you do that to your billion dollar body?\"</p><p> Coffee, soda pop and alcohol are probably the three most common drinks in our society and none of the three are particularly healthy. Limiting my caffeine intake to three cups of coffee a day has greatly reduced the amount of anxiety I experience while under stress. Since coffee stimulates our body to produce adrenaline, we become as addicted to adrenaline as we are to caffeine.</p><p> What we drink is as important as what we eat. Dr. Peter G. Hanson says in his book, The Joy of Stress, &ldquo;I recommend (and drink) eight glasses of water a day. This is particularly important for anyone experiencing a lot of stress.\"</p><h3> Exercise</h3><p> <br/> Exercise not an option. Inactivity kills. It stagnates the brain and poisons the body. This is not some philosophical concept. It is science and medical fact. The fittest generally live the longest and are the healthiest.</p><p> Regular and moderate exercise offers many benefits: a feeling of well-being, increased self-confidence, and reduced irritability and fatigue. Above all, research studies show that a person who exercises becomes noticeably healthier.</p><p> The more physically active a person is, the lower the risk of suffering a heart attack. Losing an uncle at 38 to a killer heart attack was enough to convince me! Exercise can also help relieve anxiety and tension found in high-pressure work or in challenging life circumstances.</p><p> For weight control, exercise offers a double benefit: it not only uses up calories directly, but extra calories continue to be burned up by the body up to 15 hours after the exercise. In general, exercise decreases appetite, helping the body to readjust food intake to energy expenditure.</p><p> With all the benefits of exercise, why are more people not doing it? I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Because it&rsquo;s easy to do and it&rsquo;s even easier not to do!</p><p> Dr. Kenneth Cooper says that when you exercise, you activate the pituitary gland, flooding the system with endorphins, which are two hundred times more powerful than morphine. As a result, for the next one to three hours, your energy level is higher and your creativity is at its peak.</p><p> <strong>  The Benefits of Exercising Are Many: </strong></p><li> It helps reduce tension, anxiety, depression and other symptoms of stress.</li><li> It improves our ability to think and concentrate.</li><li> It increases our energy level, making us feel great.</li><li> It improves our endurance and the length of our life.</li><li> It strengthens our cardiovascular system.</li><li> It uplifts us mentally, helping us feel positive.</li><p> <br/> The key is to play hard physically if you want to work hard mentally yet not burn out. The harder I work with my mind, the more time I spend exercising.</p><p> Your exercise time can also be your time of solitude. However, if you have trouble with self-discipline, exercising with a buddy can provide the accountability you need. They can keep you going when you feel like stopping.</p><p> ​What will you do to begin the renewal of your mind and the the transformation of your body?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-29 14:51:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-29 14:51:57.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_LmmlpK2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-easily-transform-your-body-by-completely-renewing-your-mind/\", \"post_id\": \"5761\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-29 14:51:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-29 14:51:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-easily-transform-your-body-by-completely-renewing-your-mind\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5760\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2622\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-30-at-9.18.55-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"911\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441047600,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2562,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Health Insurance Research","link":"health-insurance-research","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Once upon a time, a health insurance plan offered by an employer was almost always the best option for couples and families. Group plans were able to offer affordable, broad coverage with low deductibles, and many employers paid a substantial share of the premiums.</p><p> That was then. Now, in the age of two-career families, soaring health care costs, and the changes Obamacare has brought to the health insurance market, the choices are much more complicated. <strong>  It's up to consumers to do the research to find the best options for themselves and their families. </strong></p><h3> Here are some suggestions to help with that research:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. If both spouses are employed and both employers offer insurance, start by comparing the employers' plans. </strong> Don't just pick the lower premium and call it good, either. I'd suggest setting up a spreadsheet or chart to make it easier, and dig into the details of each plan. Compare the following:</p><li> The specifics of what is covered and what is excluded</li><li> Copays for office visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and medications</li><li> In-network and out-of-network costs</li><li> Deductible amounts</li><li> Annual out-of-pocket maximums</li><p> <br/> Also investigate each company's employee policies related to health insurance. Some employers have restrictions or added costs that affect the availability of insurance for family members. Examples to look for include:</p><li> Not covering spouses who can get insurance from their own employers</li><li> Surcharges to cover spouses or dependents</li><li> Income-adjusted premiums</li><p> <br/> <strong>  2. Evaluate your health care history and probable needs for the coming year. </strong> Ask your current health insurance company for the explanation of benefits for the past year, or go through your checkbook and list all your health care expenses. Then get out your crystal ball and consider what kinds of health care your family might need in the near future.</p><p> You can't predict everything, obviously, but you can at least make educated guesses about probable expenses like routine checkups, regular medications, visits to specialists, and elective surgeries. Take your lifestyle into account, as well. If you travel a lot, for example, you may need to use out-of-network health care more often.</p><p> <strong>  3. Make sure the plans' networks include all your doctors, including specialists like dermatologists as well as your family clinic. </strong> You can get this information from the insurance companies, but it's often easier to call the doctors' offices and ask which insurance companies they have agreements with.</p><p> <strong>  4. Check out plans offered through your state's insurance exchange. </strong> If you don't qualify for subsidies, these plans may be more expensive than employer plans. Don't assume this to be the case, though; find out.</p><p> <strong>  5. Investigate  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p969/ar02.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Health Savings Accounts  </a>  . </strong> An HSA offers a tax-advantaged way to save money for out-of-pocket medical costs. It is available to those covered by health insurance plans with high deductibles (currently $1,300 for individuals and $2,600 for families). However, not all high-deductible plans are eligible for HSA's.</p><p> Annual pretax contributions to HSA's are capped at $3,350 for individuals and $6,650 for families (plus another $1000 for those over 55). There is no time limit for withdrawing the funds, which are not taxed if they are used for medical costs. Before you open an HSA, make sure you're eligible, and look for low investment fees. Ironically, because of the tax advantages, you may get the most benefit from an HSA by not using it for health care expenses but leaving the funds in the account to grow.</p><p> <strong>  Doing this much research before choosing a health insurance plan may seem daunting. </strong> Yet it's well worth your time. The more informed you are, the better able you are to select the best available coverage at the lowest cost.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-29 15:00:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-29 15:00:12.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_iLCfHhF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/health-insurance-research/\", \"post_id\": \"5763\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-29 15:00:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-29 15:00:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"health-insurance-research\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5762\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2623\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-30-at-10.09.26-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"747\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441017900,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Research by Daniel A. Newark, Francis J. Flynn, and Vanessa K. Bohns shows that saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; makes people feel guilty and therefore raises their likelihood of saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to an asker&rsquo;s next request. For example, in an experiment, people on a university campus who refused to do a stranger a favor by filling out a questionnaire were subsequently 30% more likely to agree to the stranger&rsquo;s second request, which was to mail a letter.</p><p> Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://links.mkt3142.com/ctt?kn=12&amp;ms=MTIyMTEyNjkS1&amp;r=MjQ3OTc4MzUzNwS2&amp;b=0&amp;j=NjAxNzE4MjMyS0&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   You&rsquo;re Already More Persuasive than You Think  </a> </u></p><p> That&rsquo;s pretty impressive when you think that 30% of those who refuse the first time are more than likely to agree a second time around.

{"original_id":2564,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Systemic Risk of International Financial Regulation","link":"the-systemic-risk-of-international-financial-regulation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapcoNA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Philip Booth  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.capco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Capco  </u> </a></p><p> In the last 30 years there has been a huge movement towards the internationalisation of financial regulation. This manifests itself at the EU level but also more widely.</p><p> We have the Basel Accord, the EU&rsquo;s Solvency II, International Accounting Standards (the IAS), the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSC), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), all the EU financial markets directives (for example MiFID), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Some are just vehicles for co-operation but in all cases, the trend goes in one direction only &ndash; more international harmonisation of regulation and more regulation.</p><p> There are many reasons given for this trend. One is that it is supposed to prevent regulatory arbitrage. This means it is supposed to prevent financial institutions trying to do business from less-well-regulated jurisdictions, though the reality is that it may just make more complex the methods by which regulation is avoided.</p><p> A second reason is that international regulation is said to promote free trade, globalisation and the development of a truly international market in financial services. There is something in this, but we should note that, back in the late nineteenth century, the UK was also part of a great globalised financial system and there was very little statutory regulation at all. And the system was really quite stable.</p><h3> The Problems of Regulation Harmonisation Are Too Often Ignored</h3><p> <br/> When regulation is taken to higher international levels, by its nature it becomes more complex because it has to cope with a wider variety of situations. We see this in the way the Basel Accord developed. The Basel Accord of 1988 was the first international prudential regulatory agreement for banks. It was just 30 pages long. Because the accord had to deal with so many different and complex situations across diverse banking systems &ndash; and because it could therefore be gamed it became unsustainable. Its successor, Basel II was 347 pages. Basel III was agreed in 2010 following the crisis and weighed in at 616 pages &ndash; twenty times the length of Basel I.</p><p> Unfortunately, complexity begets more complexity and, quite soon, only experts in the subject understand regulation. Some of the strongest supporters of complex regulation then become those big businesses that are able to spend large amounts of money on lobbyists and who play an active part in the process of developing regulation or regulators themselves. In other words, there is a classic case of regulatory capture &ndash; either by the regulatory bureaucracy or by the businesses being regulated.</p><h3> Receipe for Bad Regulation</h3><p> <br/> I believe this is a recipe for bad regulation; for anti-competitive regulation that makes it more difficult for small players to enter the market; and for regulation that is incomprehensible to anybody but the expert. If regulation is hard to grasp, risk management and compliance processes will become more complex and it will become very difficult for directors, shareholders, financial analysts and so on to hold companies to account. We can contrast this situation with the 1870 Insurance Companies Act. This simply required that insurance companies published information to the market and published the basis upon which it was calculated. It was the markets&rsquo; responsibility to discipline companies. And it worked. Only two life insurance companies were wound up for reasons of insolvency in the 100 years after the act and in neither case did policyholders suffer.</p><p> Indeed, Solvency II, the EU framework for harmonised insurance regulation provides another amusing example of regulatory complexity. The list of typographical errors alone in one tiny part of the Solvency II regulations: &ldquo;the technical specifications for the preparatory phase&rdquo; is longer than the whole of the 1870 Insurance Companies&rsquo; Act.</p><h3> The Principle-Agent Problem of International Regulation</h3><p> <br/> There is, indeed, a huge principle-agent problem at the heart of internationalised financial regulation. The agents (the regulatory authorities) are supposed to be regulating in the public interest. But by what mechanism are they to be held to account? There is no obvious way by which the European Commission, the Bank for International Settlements and so on and can be held to account by those on whose behalf they are regulating.</p><h3> Encouraging Common Stocks and Herding</h3><p> <br/> Instead of the financial system being made up of institutions that see things differently, do different things, try different approaches to managing risk, and so on, we are promoting a system in which institutions behave in more similar ways and manage risks in more similar ways so that the system will fail catastrophically if it does fail.</p><p> Indeed, the classical approach to regulating banks is that you should try to regulate them so that they fail safely, without bringing down the financial system. The new approach to financial regulation requires institutions to hold so much capital that they will hardly ever fail (that is an explicit objective of policy). But, because they all have their regulatory capital determined in similar ways, when they do fail the whole system will fail at the same time.</p><p> As Avinash Persaud, former director of the Global Association of Risk Professionals put it: &ldquo;Regulators must dare to consider what a resilient financial system would look like. I would venture that it is one where a shock in one part of the system can be absorbed by another part, and not spread and amplified across all the others. For this to happen, we need a financial system in which the different parts assess, value, hedge, and trade the same assets or activities differently&rdquo;. He further argues that it is herd-like behaviour and not risky assets that creates catastrophic risks. Such heterogeneity is nurtured by not having prescriptive and uniform regulation.</p><p> The way in which shocks can be amplified if firms have similar systems of risk management, similar asset liabilities structures and similar methods of accounting was shown in the financial crisis, before which and then during which International Accounting Standards, encouraged similar behaviours amongst affected banks. This behaviour then reinforced the problems caused by the crisis.</p><h3> Evolution in Regulation</h3><p> <br/> People might want harmonisation of regulations around the &ldquo;right&rdquo; rules &ndash; though I would be wary even of that for the reasons I have explained. However, we do not know the &ldquo;right&rdquo; rules in advance. And, if regulators get regulation wrong, it can promote, herding towards behaviours that are especially risky.</p><p> For example, there are concerns that Solvency II will artificially encourage investment in government bonds and, if these prove to be of questionable credit risk, there is a danger of large insurance companies across the EU, encouraged by regulation, making the same mistake simultaneously.</p><p> We also saw this in the banking crisis. The Basel bank capital setting regime provided relatively high capital weights for mortgages even if they were not especially risky, but it had lower capital weights for securitised mortgages, especially if they had a strong credit rating. Sovereign bonds were also favourably treated. This distorted the activities of ratings agencies and of banks; it encouraged securitisation (which was already encouraged by US government guarantees); and it encouraged opacity. Indeed, it is a curiosity that we now look at one country which did not do too badly out of the banking crisis &ndash; Canada &ndash; because it did not follow the international approach to regulation and argue that Canada&rsquo;s approach should be adopted internationally!</p><p> In conclusion, I cannot summarise the problem much better than Yale law academic and NBER scholar Robarta Romano. As she put it: &ldquo;Recent experience suggests that regulatory harmonisation can increase, rather than decrease, systemic risk. By incentivising financial institutions worldwide to follow broadly similar business strategies, regulatory error contributed to a global financial crisis&hellip;there are bound to be regulatory mistakes, both large and small. Moreover, an internationally-harmonised regime impedes the acquisition of information concerning the comparative effectiveness of differing regulatory arrangements, lowering the quality of decision making, as nations are discouraged from experimenting with alternative regulatory arrangements.&rdquo;</p><h3> If International Harmonisation is the Problem, What Should We do?</h3><p> <br/> We should take more risks with under-regulation. Ever since 1980, we have been trying to control financial institutions with ever-more regulation. It has not been a success.</p><p> Secondly, we should recognise that we do not need international regulation for the free flow of capital and free trade in services. Many financial institutions do work on an international basis in a relatively unregulated environment and, where regulation is necessary, the most successful regulatory practices are often developed by market institutions themselves.</p><p> Thirdly, we might have to recognise that banks &ndash; including within the EU &ndash; should have to have separate legal personalities in different countries, especially if they are the beneficiaries of deposit insurance. This is not regulation as such, and it is not an impediment to free trade &ndash; though it may raise the costs of trade &ndash; but it may be an essential requirement to ensure that banks can be subject to proper winding-up procedures. In short, there are alternatives to the never-ending attempts to create more and more complex and prescriptive international financial regulation.</p><p> Repost from Philip Booth - Professor of Insurance and Risk Management, Cass Business School - based on his presentation to the  <u>  Cass Capco Conference: Risk Rebooted </u>  in June 2015.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-29 15:35:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-29 15:35:26.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_9OWTgr4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-systemic-risk-of-international-financial-regulation/\", \"post_id\": \"5767\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-29 15:35:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-29 15:35:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-systemic-risk-of-international-financial-regulation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5766\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2625\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-30-at-10.12.53-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"831\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441022400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

But why do so many advisers insist on listing products or services in industry jargon on their &ldquo;menu&rdquo; for clients to choose from?</p><p> What sense does it make to the typical consumer to be offered a document somewhere near the beginning of a possible engagement where they get to choose whether they would like the adviser to talk to them about (say):</p><li> Income Protection Insurance</li><li> Total &amp; Permanent Disability Cover</li><li> Critical Illness Insurance</li><li> Managed Funds <br/>  </li><p> Often enough these lists of possible products or &ldquo;services&rdquo; run to near on 2 dozen bland and boring financial services products.</p><h3> Advisers then complain that &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; is responsible for consumers opting out of the full advice process.</h3><p> <br/> Actually, Regulators have nothing to do with advisers being boring and speaking in a language that consumers are not interested in, even if they did understand it.  It is simply poor communication by the adviser concerned.  When did compliance insist on the industry talking in language which disengages consumers or makes it difficult for them to comprehend what we do?</p><p> I pay a fairly hefty premium for an excellent income protection product myself &ndash; and am happy to do so.  It isn&rsquo;t because I love income protection products and enjoy paying for them.  It isn&rsquo;t because I am a loyal brand advocate for the boring insurer (who frankly is bloody poor at communicating with me as a client &ndash; thank god I have a great personal financial adviser!).</p><p> I pay a small fortune for this, and other risk protection products, because I care about making sure that money continues to come into the household so the people I care about can continue to eat, live and pursue their lives and plans if I cannot provide for them. I pay the premium &ndash; and take a known loss I can stomach &ndash; so that the people I care about don&rsquo;t have to worry about having money for food and shelter if I can&rsquo;t provide it.</p><p> I buy insurance so money will still be there even if I am not able to be here or provide any.  I save money so that I will have enough to live on when I cannot earn more through labour.  The &ldquo;why&rsquo;s&rdquo; are pretty simple aren&rsquo;t they?</p><p> <strong>  So when it comes to engaging with potential clients why would we ignore the key motivations for using financial products as a means of addressing the real fears and concerns?  The motivations that matter really are things like: </strong></p><li> Survival, and meeting basic daily needs like keeping the family home or eating.</li><li> Care and protection of loved ones.</li><li> Freedom from fear, anxiety or threat.</li><li> Enjoyment of some better things in life (food and wine!).</li><li> Being responsible, or well remembered.</li><li> To be superior, winning, keeping up with peers.</li><li> Social approval. <br/>  </li><p> Our engagement documents and the language we use to describe the products or services we can provide need to be presented in these terms. Advisers cannot let their own compliance fears make them lose sight of the important &ldquo;WHY&rsquo;s&rdquo; that drive consumer engagement.</p><p> <strong>  A great &ndash; and compliant &ndash; engagement document for defining the scope should be in language which is aligned with the motivations and outcomes that can be created rather than product or industry jargon.  For example: </strong></p><li> Ensuring ongoing income after illness or accident</li><li> Keeping the family home in event of disaster</li><li> Owning our home faster</li><li> Kid&rsquo;s fast start with debt-free education planning</li><p> <br/> These sorts of descriptions still absolutely define the scope of the engagement.  They obtain consent from the consumer about the areas of concern or planning where advice can be useful for them (in their opinion), but do so in a meaningful way as they address real life concerns and motivations.  It is up to us to then figure out how our products and services can be used to provide good solutions to these issues.</p><p> Compliance is about good process rather than the language being used.  Stick with great process and get agreement for engagement recorded with clients.

As I&rsquo;ve written earlier, during the prospecting call you need to qualify your prospect on six different qualifiers, and one of those is time frame. Here again are a couple of qualifying questions on the cold call that would have prevented this objection from ever coming up:</p><p> &ldquo;If you like our solution when we go over the presentation next week, what would be your timeframe for putting it to use for you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;And if you like what you see next week, is this something you could make a decision on right away?&rdquo;</p><p> Again, these kinds of qualifying questions are the ones you ask during the initial call so you don&rsquo;t get this objection during the close.</p><p> <strong>  Another way to avoid this objection is to re-qualify before the closing presentation. </strong>  I always recommend you re-qualify at the beginning of your demo so you aren&rsquo;t ambushed with objections like, &ldquo;Do you expect me to make a decision, like, now?&rdquo; Here are a couple of questions to ask before you begin your demo:</p><p> &ldquo;And ________, let me ask you: if, after we finish the demo today, you like what you see and can see how it can help you (repeat their buying motive), is this something that you can make a decision on today?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;And __________, let&rsquo;s talk about your time frame for putting this solution to work for you. If you like what you see today, how soon could you move on it?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Again, by using any of these techniques, you can avoid the two objections above. </strong> &ldquo;But what if I still get these objections at the end??&rdquo; I can just hear you asking&hellip; The key here is to then isolate the objection so you can see what you&rsquo;re really dealing with. And the best way to do that is to ask questions and listen. Try:</p><p> &ldquo;What is your timeline then?&rdquo;</p><p> And Layer:</p><p> &ldquo;Based on what we&rsquo;ve gone over today, how does this sound to you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I can certainly appreciate that, but while you&rsquo;re thinking it over, consider this&hellip;&rdquo; And keep pitching one or two points you know they really like. And then: &ldquo;Does that make sense to you?&rdquo; And if it does, then ask for the order again: &ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t we do this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Never take one no (or two or three or four for that matter) as the ultimate answer, but instead be ready to pitch the benefits and continue to ask for the order. </strong></p><p> The other objection: &ldquo;We need to do some research first,&rdquo; can and should also be prevented by qualifying for timeline during the initial call, but if it still comes up, then treat it like any other stall and try to get to the real objection that is hiding behind it. And, as always, use a few proven scripts to make it easy, and ask questions that are designed to get your prospects to reveal what it&rsquo;s going to take to close the sale. Try:</p><p> &ldquo;I totally understand &ndash; just out of curiosity, what parts do you need to do research on?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;O.K., when you say research, does that involve comparing it to other companies?&rdquo;</p><p> [If Yes]</p><p> &ldquo;And what part of this are you comparing the most?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I help my clients do research all the time &ndash; in fact, because of I have access to so many resources in this industry, I can usually get answers and solutions they can&rsquo;t. Tell me, what specifically are you interested in learning more about?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;And, based on what you know about it now, if your research comes back positive, does this sound like a solution that would work for you?&rdquo;</p><p> [If Yes]</p><p> &ldquo;Great! And what is your timeline for acting on this?&rdquo;</p><p> [If you get a date]</p><p> &ldquo;Terrific! Then let me help you do the research so you can put this exciting (profitable, proven, etc.) solution to work for you today!&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;________, I&rsquo;ve only given you part of my presentation because I didn&rsquo;t want to overwhelm you.

{"original_id":2570,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Selling Your Business? Be Inclusive!","link":"selling-your-business-be-inclusive","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Generational diversity is alive and well in the workplace today. Though baby boomers and Gen-X employees may struggle to understand millennials, and vice versa, the number of generations in the workplace continues to grow as Gen-Z joins its older cohorts.</p><h3> Many baby boomers, however, are on their way out.</h3><p> <br/> They&rsquo;re preparing for retirement and their next phase in life. For some, this simply means letting their supervisors know that they&rsquo;re planning to retire. Some boomers, though, are business owners, and this adds an extra step in the retirement process&mdash;finding someone to buy the company.</p><p> This can be a stressful, and even an emotional, process. After all, most of these companies were start-ups or family-run businesses. Letting go of something that&rsquo;s been yours for so many years is difficult. As difficult and exhausting as the process may be, it&rsquo;s a necessary transition for many. In fact, due to the growing number of retirements and an improving economy, this has become a very popular time to sell a business. In Stacy Cowley&rsquo;s New York Times article  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/business/smallbusiness/baby-boomers-ready-to-sell-businesses-to-the-next-generation.html\" target=\"_blank\">   \"Baby Boomers Ready to Sell Businesses to the Next Generation,\"  </a> </u>  she says BizBuySell.com data reveals that &ldquo;the number of small businesses listed for sale nationwide is at a six-year high.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  While many of those baby boomers selling businesses today are white men, when they do they&rsquo;re often selling them to a wide array of individuals from diverse backgrounds. </strong> As Cowley tells us, 30-percent of business buyers are black, Asian or Hispanic. Additionally, &ldquo;women are also more heavily represented in the younger generation. Nine percent of the buyers over 65 in the study were women, compared with more than 20 percent of those under 49.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, it&rsquo;s time for us to recognize a new paradigm of business ownership&mdash;one that spans a wide range of ages, races and cultures. As business owners who may be on the verge of retiring, this is a call to be inclusive of all who might be interested in carrying on the legacy of their companies&mdash;and also a time to be alert to any potential unconscious biases they may have.</p><p> <strong>  When selling a business, it may be tempting to choose a buyer who closely resembles your own background. </strong> In this increasingly heterogeneous economy, though, that may not be the best choice for the future success of the business. Keep an open mind to the opportunity to pass the torch to someone with a different background and frame of reference, potentially someone who most resembles the market they will be serving.</p><p> The workforce, and the marketplace, are far more diverse than they used to be, and that means it&rsquo;s time to embrace diversity in business ownership. If you&rsquo;re looking to sell your business, don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of unconscious bias when considering bids&mdash;be inclusive!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-30 16:06:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-30 16:06:42.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_iG18SAo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/selling-your-business-be-inclusive/\", \"post_id\": \"5779\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-30 16:06:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-30 16:06:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"selling-your-business-be-inclusive\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5778\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2632\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-30-at-9.17.02-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"677\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441026000,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}

Facebook is one of the top social media networks used by small businesses due to the large viewership and the ease of advertising. Facebook Groups is one way to use the social media site for business and a method that isn&rsquo;t often used. The following tips will help you use Facebook Groups effectively.</p><h3> Join Other Groups</h3><p> <br/> While you do have the option of creating your own group, you will be more successful by joining other groups. The tricky part is choosing the right one. You want a group that has a large following, but is also followed by people in your target market. If your target market is young males between 20 and 35, following a group that is mainly followed by women in their 40s won&rsquo;t do you much good. As long as you have done your target research, you should be able to locate some excellent groups. If you get stuck, try the &ldquo;Suggested Groups&rdquo; function on Facebook.</p><h3> Be Helpful</h3><p> <br/> Facebook Groups should never be used simply for self-promotion. One of the best ways to use them effectively is by being helpful and answering other people&rsquo;s questions. If you are a graphic designer and joined a group with other designers, look for questions you can answer based on your own expertise. You might find that when you start becoming helpful in the group, members start following your Facebook fan page. It can also result in referrals and business networking.</p><h3> Ask for Advice or Input</h3><p> <br/> Not only should you help with other people&rsquo;s questions, but you can also ask for advice or input. Again, be careful how much you talk about your own business, but it is okay to ask for advice from other knowledgeable members. This is a great source of information when trying to name a new product line or decide on the color scheme of your business blog. You are in a group with other like-minded individuals that like to help each other out. You can also inform others of your products by asking such questions without being too obvious.</p><h3> Promote Your Events</h3><p> <br/> It is okay to promote your own events in other groups, but make sure it is okay by the admins first. If not, you can always create your own Facebook Group. This group can be for fans and followers of your business, or be a group that is more generalized for your industry, not necessarily for your business. No matter which way you go, the groups are an excellent source for promoting and announcing events, contests, and promotions.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-30 16:26:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-30 16:26:14.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_My4zKWW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-use-facebook-groups-to-build-your-small-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5781\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-30 16:26:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-30 16:26:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-use-facebook-groups-to-build-your-small-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5780\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2633\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-30-at-9.28.27-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"399\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441050300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2572,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"ADHD-The Sleep Connection","link":"adhd-the-sleep-connection","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There has been an astounding increase in the number of children diagnosed with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). In one study, the increase approached 800% in the past decade over the last.</p><h3> Is there something driving this or are we making the diagnosis too often?</h3><p> <br/> We know that both childhood sleep apnea and insufficient sleep can present with symptoms indistinguishable from ADHD. These symptoms consist of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and an inability to pay attention. Because of the proliferation of computers, video games, iPhones, and televisions in our children&rsquo;s bedrooms they are getting less sleep. In fact, a Finnish study published several years ago found that a sleep duration of between seven and eight hours or less in children aged seven to eight was a significant factor in predicting ADHD. In my own sleep practice, I am amazed by the number of caring parents that are unaware of just how much sleep children require. Actually, a child of eight years of age requires closer to 11 hours of sleep nightly. Deprived of this they become irritable, have difficulty sitting still, and can have a very hard time concentrating. Is it any wonder that they may be thought to have ADHD?</p><p> Sleep apnea is also very common in ADHD. In one study performed a few years ago, 28% of children referred to an ENT clinic for an adenotonsillectomy for sleep apnea had a diagnosis of ADHD. Interestingly, after the procedure, 50% no longer evidenced symptoms of ADHD after one year..</p><p> Finally, children with restless legs syndrome can present with symptoms that are hard to differentiate from ADHD. Many of these children have a hard time relating what they are feeling or are misdiagnosed as having &ldquo;growing pains.&rdquo; Their leg pain can deprive them of much needed sleep at night or make it impossible to sit still in class during the day.</p><h3> Is it any wonder that they are frequently diagnosed with ADHD?</h3><p> <br/> The bottom line is that not all cases of ADHD can be attributed to sleep disorders. However, many are either caused or worsened by problems with sleep. It is our job as parents to be aware of our children&rsquo;s sleep needs and sleep habits. If you have a child with ADHD, take the time to notice such things as snoring, an inability to fall or stay asleep , complaints of always feeling tired and fatigued, or frequent leg movements at rest or while asleep.

{"original_id":2574,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"$200,000 Reasons to Wait to Get Remarried","link":"200000-reasons-to-wait-to-get-remarried","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Married, divorced, single, re-married...does your marital status really affect your potential social security benefits? </strong> Absolutely! Not knowing how design a social security income strategy based on your marital status (or future martial status) can have a significant affect on your lifetime benefits.</p><p> With the divorce rate still at about 50% for first marriages, the need for divorced spouses to do planning is very important and requires an in-depth understanding of the social security rules.  If a divorced spouse is considering re-marriage, then the timing and co-ordination of benefits between the divorced person, their ex-spouse and future spouse is even more important.</p><p> For example, I had a client who was 61, divorced (was married for over 20 years and divorced for over 2 years) and is now in a new relationship. She was given an analysis of her expected social security benefits from her divorce attorney. She came to me to find out how to best co-ordinate her benefits \"if\" she was to get re-married in the future. Since her former husband was the primary income earner in their marriage, his social security benefit was about twice hers. Her new boyfriend's benefit was similar to hers.  So, what were her options?</p><p> At her full retirement age (66) she would be eligible to collect 50% of her ex-spouse's benefit.  To optimize her lifetime benefit, I suggested that she take her ex-spousal benefit at age 66 until her age 70 and then switch to her own, then higher benefit. I also let her know that she would be eligible to receive his full benefit if he were to pre-decease her. </p><h3> But what if she were to get re-married? </h3><p> <br/> Basically, as soon as you re-marry you lose all benefits off of your ex-spouse.  Therefore, she would lose her ex-spousal benefit immediately upon re-marriage. She would still be eligible to receive a survivor benefit off of her ex-spouse (even if she re-marries) because she would have re-married after the age of 60. (yet another exception in the quirky social security rule book).</p><p> If she married her boyfriend, she would then be eligible to collect a spousal benefit off of his benefit once she turned 66 and assuming he had already filed for his benefits.  She would also have to be married for 12 months before she could collect a spousal benefit off of her new husband.  One exception to the 12 month rule is if she was already collecting ex-spousal benefits when she re-married.  In that scenario the 12 month rule would not apply. (once again, another crazy and little known exception in the social security rule book!)</p><h3> So, what would it cost her in lost social security benefits to get re-married before her age 66? </h3><p> <br/> In her particular case it would cost her a minimum of $40,000 from ages 66-70.  That's the difference between her ex-spousal benefits and spousal benefits off of her new spouse.  If she waits until age 70 to get married then she could collect the $40,000 of additional benefits off of her ex-spouse and then switch to her own benefit at age 70.   <br/> <br/> This is just an example of how social security benefits can be affected by re-marriage. When analyzing the affect of re-marriage on social security benefits, one must look at a number of factors for all three parties involved including their ages, benefit amounts at full retirement age, the date of re-marriage, who has filed for benefits and when, is it a second marriage for one or both spouses, past earnings records and future expected earnings and a number of other factors.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  It's not a simple analysis and often requires a custom solution. </strong>   However, given the importance of social security retirement benefits, especially for divorced individuals, it is imperative that all options be considered in order to maximize potential benefits.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 15:16:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 15:16:34.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_5RcTJ9j.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/200000-reasons-to-wait-to-get-remarried/\", \"post_id\": \"5787\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 15:16:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 15:16:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"200000-reasons-to-wait-to-get-remarried\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5786\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2636\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/photo-1439663036300-8222ab73fe76.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"615\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441108800,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2575,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 10 Mistakes That Will Ruin Your Content Marketing","link":"the-10-mistakes-that-will-ruin-your-content-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Content marketing is a powerful way for any business to cultivate relationships online and better position itself as a resource and solution to its clearly defined target audience. I think it&rsquo;s easy for firms and businesses to buy-in to the value of content marketing, but when it comes to implementing content marketing there are several behaviors that get in the way of long-term success.</p><p> With more and more businesses embracing content marketing as its marketing strategy of choice, there are a few mistakes that will certainly curtail your content marketing success if you&rsquo;re not careful:</p><h3> 1. You Lack a Strong Value Proposition</h3><p> <br/> Firms that are the most successful with content marketing have strong branding and value proposition. It&rsquo;s these fundamental, core messages that are reinforced over and over again through the fresh content that a content marketing strategy determines. So before you get busy creating or outsourcing content, what&rsquo;s your story first? What makes your service special and why should someone choose you over anyone else? Because content is the extension of your brand, you have to really nail down your own brand story first if you&rsquo;re going to communicate a consistent message that aligns with your brand and attracts your ideal client to your business.</p><h3> 2. You Don&rsquo;t Set Specific Goals</h3><p> <br/> What is the purpose of your content marketing strategy? Ambiguous goals will crush your content marketing momentum before it can take off. Simply saying things like, &ldquo;I want more leads&rdquo; and &ldquo;To raise awareness&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t specific enough. Specificity is necessary in order to stay focused and on track to achieve real, tangible results.  Make sure you set SMART goals for your content marketing efforts. They need to be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely:</p><h3> 3. You Don&rsquo;t Define a Specific Audience</h3><p> <br/> Content marketing success hinges on the ability to create useful content for a clearly defined audience. If you aren&rsquo;t willing to narrow your target audience, you are setting yourself up for content marketing failure. You simply can&rsquo;t be everything to everyone. If an audience doesn&rsquo;t feel like they are being spoken to directly, they may miss that you were trying to talk to them at all. As an example, not all people within a certain generation are the same, nor do they use the same language to describe the things they care about. Content marketing and niches are an incredibly powerful pairing. I know of an attorney who also happens to be very entrenched in the CrossFit community. She herself is into CrossFit and has positioned herself as the legal representation for CrossFit gyms and other businesses associated with CrossFit. She knows their culture. She speaks their language. And she is able to create highly relevant content that her ideal clients actually care about.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to narrow your audience.</p><h3> 4. You Omit Tone and Personality</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s be honest. There is a lot more content out there today than there was a year ago and there will continue to be more content than there is demand as more companies become publishers. What you say is important and how you say it will help you even more. The tone in which you create content and the brand personality that you infuse in your digital assets is yet another important factor in attracting your ideal client to your business. Most customers meet you online first before they see you in person; therefore, make sure your content is a true representation of who you and your brand are. If you want to bridge a connection with your ideal client with your content efforts, you have to give them something more human to connect to in the first place.</p><h3> 5. You Lack Discipline</h3><p> <br/> Content marketing is like a lifestyle change. Establishing good habits doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight, but they are necessary for long-term, sustainable results. For this reason, you have to be committed to the process. If you start getting itchy around months 3 or 4 because you feel like you aren&rsquo;t seeing results fast enough, the worst possible thing you could do is abandon the strategy in favor of a quick fix. That would be like someone who is looking to get into better shape, who has a workout and nutrition plan and starts off really strong. The first couple of months were tough to kick-start, but you&rsquo;re in it now. Then, even though you aren&rsquo;t that far into your plan you get discouraged because you didn&rsquo;t reach the goals you set for yourself by 12 months in 4 months. You quit your regimen and buy fat burners instead. Content marketing takes discipline and the results are really favorable for firms that stick with the program.</p><h3> 6. You Create Crappy Content</h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it. You shouldn&rsquo;t be creating content for the sake of creating content. It needs to actually be good and useful to your target audience. People aren&rsquo;t attracted to your content simply because you create it. Google isn&rsquo;t even fooled by subpar content. So make sure whatever you produce is of high quality. When I read content that has grammatical errors, ugly graphics or is just bad writing, I will never trust that source of content again. If you make a bad first impression online, you may not have a chance to make up for it. Think of it this way: You are your content.</p><h3> 7. You Don&rsquo;t Promote Your Content</h3><p> <br/> However long it takes you to create content, you need to be spending even more time promoting it. People don&rsquo;t flock to your content and they definitely aren&rsquo;t chomping at the bit for you to release your next blog post. (I know, it&rsquo;s a sad truth.) As I mentioned earlier, there is a lot of content out there competing for your ideal client&rsquo;s time and attention. Therefore, if you don&rsquo;t have a plan in place for how you are actually going to reach your ideal clients with your great content, you&rsquo;re in trouble. There are various channels to leverage, as well as considerations of timing and frequency. These details are determined by your audience and testing.</p><h3> 8. You Don&rsquo;t Have a Plan for Existing Content</h3><p> <br/> You know all that great content you produced two years ago? What are you doing with it? If it&rsquo;s just sitting dormant on your blog and hasn&rsquo;t been touched in months or years, that&rsquo;s a mistake. Just because your content isn&rsquo;t new, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s useless. Make sure you are refreshing your content quarterly and yearly. Content has an incredibly long shelf-life if you maintain it. It is for this reason that content marketing is a smart investment in your brand. Overtime, you accumulate wonderful digital assets that can continue to increase your brand&rsquo;s value.</p><h3> 9. You Don&rsquo;t Include a Call to Action</h3><p> <br/> In order for content to perform, you have to provide your audience with the desired action you want them to take: subscribe to your blog, download an offer, sign-up for an event, share the content with their network. There should be one very clear call to action on any piece of content you produce so that you can strategically guide your audience through the experience you designed to move them closer to becoming a contact and then a client. Make whatever action you decide clear and easy to do.</p><h3> 10. You Don&rsquo;t Follow-Up</h3><p> <br/> Perhaps the biggest mistake you&rsquo;re making is not following up with the new contacts and leads you&rsquo;ve earned through your content marketing efforts. Once people take that action you determined and share their information with you, what are you doing to nurture that new relationship? Depending on your business and your prospecting process, you can automate certain follow-ups to remain top of mind and add value to your relationships. But at what point do you follow-up personally?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 15:36:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 15:36:27.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_UQ06E6b.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-10-mistakes-that-will-ruin-your-content-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"5789\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 15:36:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 15:36:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-10-mistakes-that-will-ruin-your-content-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5788\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2637\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-31-at-8.40.49-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"518\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441123200,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}

So, how will these expectations affect a relationship-driven industry like financial services?</p><h3> My take on robo advisors is that they can do some things really well, but they&rsquo;re not a one-size fits all solution.</h3><p> <br/> If someone is looking for a simple term insurance policy or a target-date fund, answer a few questions and the robo advisor can certainly provide a solution. But, for comprehensive financial solutions, I think they miss the subtleties. Let&rsquo;s say there are a range of options that someone might consider to address a given financial situation, and the quick Q&amp;A with a robo advisor might suggest one option that one the surface looks good. However, if the robo advisor does not ask the pertinent questions than key information to make a recommendation is missing &ndash; and the solution will not address the underlying need of the client.</p><p> Having a conversation with a financial advisor, one who comes to understand every aspect of the client&rsquo;s situation and their underlying life goals and values, is important to shaping the right financial plan. It would be similar to going into a car dealership and asking simply for a car &ndash; without any other information a sales person may bring you a two seat sports car when in fact you need a sedan.</p><p> As marketers, how do we bring these two worlds together and have them co-exist? We shouldn&rsquo;t hide our head in the sand and pretend that robo advisors don&rsquo;t exist. Instead, we should look for ways to add value on top of what the interactive tools can provide, and that is what Penn Mutual can do. Interactive tools can provide incredible insight but having a conversation with someone to understand what you really need or learn about options you would not have known about, is indispensable. Financial products are complicated and can be intimidating, but an expert can help to clarify their nuances and what best fits your goals.</p><p> We&rsquo;re operating in a bipolar environment, where you have two very different ways of interacting with the world and each has its own unique value. There are those who thrive on personal contact and want in-person meetings and frequent phone calls &ldquo;to touch base.&rdquo; Then there are others, mostly younger and raised on technology, who feel more comfortable interacting through apps, social media, and websites.</p><h3> That doesn&rsquo;t mean relationships go away.</h3><p> <br/> People still need a trusted advisor, but the way they want to interact is different. Advisors will be struggling with this question: What does &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; mean in this age of new virtual interactions, and how does an advisor answer the needs of clients?</p><p> Content is becoming the connective tissue of the advisor-client relationship. An important aspect about content is its ability to educate and inform. It&rsquo;s not about selling. It&rsquo;s about providing people with a perspective, giving them information they find valuable and presenting ideas to think about. If an advisor is consistently offering well-targeted and consultative content, the advisor will be top of mind when it comes time to act. Who are they going to call? Chances are the person who&rsquo;s providing the content.</p><p> Content can provide valuable insight into the needs and interests of your clients. Many tools will show what content gets read and shared, and by whom. If you look at what people are reading based on the content you share, you might discover that many of your clients are thinking, for example, of funding college education for grandchildren. Think about the specialized needs of your clients and what information you can provide them that will be useful to them.</p><p> Beyond content, I think we should be looking at expanding the use of digital touch points and tools. For example, use Skype or other videoconference tools for a virtual in-person meeting no matter where someone is located. That satisfies the needs of both the tech-literate client who values efficiency and the client who values face time conversations.</p><p> One thing is clear, virtual interactions are here to stay, and we should be embracing technology wholeheartedly as a key part of our engagement with clients. Our clients will demand it of us, and even if the relationship is a virtual one, they want choice, convenience, and control in working with an advisor. Regardless of how sophisticated the technology becomes, ours is still a relationship-based business no matter what channel clients choose to use.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 17:04:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 17:04:45.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_E1QSkw3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-does-relationship-mean-in-this-new-age-of-virtual-interactions/\", \"post_id\": \"5791\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 17:04:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 17:04:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-does-relationship-mean-in-this-new-age-of-virtual-interactions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5790\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2638\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ipadrelationship.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"825\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441110600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Those insane days where nothing seems to go as planned.  Your alarm doesn&rsquo;t go off when it&rsquo;s supposed to.  You miss your flight.  Your connecting flight is over-booked.  You get lost.  An hour has been added to your already too-long trek to your destination.  You&rsquo;re low blood-sugar, have a headache, and can&rsquo;t quite remember why you chose to do whatever it is you&rsquo;re doing.  You&rsquo;ve had days like that too, right?  Or is it just me?</p><p> Awhile ago I had the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time with Shawn Achor&rsquo;s book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307591549/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307591549&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwonstagelea-20&amp;linkId=YJMHHKW7N3OP65MQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Happiness Advantage  </a> </u> , which does a terrific job of building the business case for creating a positive organizational culture.  Shawn has traveled worldwide asking business leaders to think about the following scenario (and now I pose it to you&hellip;.):</p><p> &ldquo;Imagine for a moment that you walk into a bank.  There are 50 other people in the bank.  A robber walks in and fires his weapon once.  You are shot in the right arm.&rdquo;</p><p> Then Shawn says, &ldquo;&hellip;if you were honestly describing this event to your friends and coworkers the next day, do you describe it as lucky or unlucky?&rdquo; and challenges them to explain why they described it the way they did.</p><p> So how about you?  Would you consider yourself lucky or unlucky?  Why?</p><p> I have to tell you, when my alarm clock went off late and I missed my flight, I wasn&rsquo;t feeling so lucky &ndash; at first&hellip;</p><p> What Shawn has found, is that the split between those who think they&rsquo;re unlucky and those who think they&rsquo;re lucky is about 70/30.  70% of folks describe the bank incident as an unlucky thing, and 30% as a lucky thing.</p><p> The unlucky-thing-people would tell Shawn something like, &ldquo;I entered the bank perfectly healthy and I left in an ambulance&hellip;that&rsquo;s not my idea of a good time.&rdquo; And the lucky-thing people would say something like, &ldquo;I could have died.  I feel incredibly fortunate.&rdquo;</p><p> The situation is exactly the same, but how they processed it is totally different.</p><p> What Shawn explains in his book is that our brains, in attempt to make sense of something that&rsquo;s happened, will invent an alternate scenario &ndash; or a &ldquo;counter-fact&rdquo;.  So the unlucky people imagined an alternate scenario where they would have waltzed out of the bank unharmed, while the lucky people imagined that something far worse could have happened.</p><p> But the point that Shawn makes &ndash; that has made an incredible difference to me &ndash; is that because the alternate scenarios are made up, we have the power to &ldquo;consciously select a counter-fact that makes us feel fortunate rather than helpless.&rdquo;</p><p> Think of the power in that.  When you feel lucky, how do you show up in the world?  How do people perceive you?  What actions do you take?  When you feel unlucky, how do you show up in the world?  How do people perceive you?  What actions do you take?</p><p> Which gets better results?</p><p> <strong>  When you feel lucky, how do you show up in the world?  When you feel unlucky, how do you show up in the world?  Which gets better results? </strong></p><p> So I started paying close attention to how I was thinking about events in my life and to how the leaders I was working with described their situations.</p><p> And all around me, I began to see opportunity.  To personally experience gratitude where there would have been stress.  To identify, without much conversation, the leaders who were actively and powerfully making a difference in their organizations and those who were waiting for things to change.  And I realized how much control we all really have on how we experience the world around us and what we choose to do about it.</p><p> I remember standing in the line at Starbucks in the airport when it hit me.  The friendly-caffeinated-barista greeted me joyfully with, &ldquo;And how are you this lovely morning?!&rdquo;</p><p> Well let&rsquo;s see&hellip;my alarm didn&rsquo;t go off.  I got stuck in traffic (four accidents in-route!).  I missed my flight&hellip;</p><p> Hmmmm.  How was I?  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing just great!&rdquo; I replied.  And I meant it.  For real.  I made it to the airport safely.  I had the flexibility to arrive at my destination anytime that day.  I could afford to buy a Starbucks coffee!  All good stuff.</p><p> Now I still have to confess, I&rsquo;m not always on the &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; team &ndash; I don&rsquo;t always look for the silver lining (and when my husband suggests I might want to consider choosing another counter-fact, I want to bop him upside the head).  But being mindful of my own power to choose how I process a situation has been huge for me.  Try it on and see what you think.</p><p> <strong>  You are more powerful than you realize.  You can actually choose how you process a situation to improve your results. </strong></p><p> Are you feeling lucky?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 17:07:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 17:07:23.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_buCdeeE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-feeling-lucky/\", \"post_id\": \"5793\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 17:07:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 17:07:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-feeling-lucky\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5792\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2639\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bigstock_Lucky_Charm_905772-e1403868134387.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"659\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441126800,"author_id":281,"chart_url":""}

Everyone is tentative when their &ldquo;unknowns&rdquo; outweigh their comfort and competency&mdash;when you&rsquo;re not in your zone. Whether you are a computer engineer or an auto mechanic, when you are working in your area of knowledge and competence, you&rsquo;ve got very little anxiety and a high degree of confidence. You&rsquo;re performing at your highest level (and enjoying it). But removed from your competence zone, your mastery disappears in a puff of smoke.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re not feeling 100% competent about your finances, welcome to money gridlock.</p><p> But you don&rsquo;t have to settle for that&mdash;why continue living with that level of anxiety? </p><p> Our society places financial literacy in a position of low importance and priority. We depend on parents to teach children sound money skills and financial knowledge&mdash;yet in too many cases, this is a really bad idea. How many parents are properly equipped or trained to help their children understand issues like delayed gratification, the importance of a budget, financial goal-setting and a clear distinction between a &ldquo;need&rdquo; and a &ldquo;want&rdquo;? Were yours?</p><p> &ldquo;My parents grew up poor and they had nothing. They believed in saving&mdash;not spending. So I had very little as a child and I don&rsquo;t want MY children to experience the same level of deprivation.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;My daughter&rsquo;s best friends went to Aruba over the winter break; I don&rsquo;t want her to feel bad that she didn&rsquo;t go away too!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;We needed to join the Country Club&mdash;all of our friends were there.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really need anything, but the anniversary sale at Nordstrom was just too good to pass up.&rdquo;</p><p> These all too common statements are the by-products of confused priorities and lack of sound understanding of money, risk, security and the &ldquo;how to&rsquo;s&rdquo; of personal financial management.</p><p> Getting beyond the gridlock of confused or broken money beliefs begins with some very serious questions and the recognition that &ldquo;having it all&rdquo; in terms of material goods might not be a reasonable expectation.</p><p> <strong>  Question 1: What do I really want out of life? </strong>  It&rsquo;s about your values, not things.</p><p> <strong>  Question 2: Do I have sufficient knowledge to navigate appropriately toward my goals? </strong>  If you don&rsquo;t have the knowledge, there are books, resources and advisors to help.</p><p> <strong>  Question 3: What support do I need to keep me focused on making good decisions? </strong>  This is about finding the trigger that keeps you on track rather than becoming a slave to that &ldquo;oh, well&rdquo; part of you that caves to the crave. It&rsquo;s like those candies at the grocery store check-out line, carefully placed so they are enticing to just add it to your pile. What keeps you from saying no?</p><p> Creating your successful money zone is about gaining control, competence and confidence in dealing with all the impediments and obstacles thrown in your path. There is a minefield of commercial challenges placed in your way to separate you from your money and your ultimate goals&mdash;you cannot Google a product without it showing up on your Facebook page six seconds later. So begin by knowing what you really want. Start learning about money, observing your spending habits and when you fall prey to the urge to spend on something that isn&rsquo;t 100% in line with your priorities.</p><p> If controlling your habits is a real problem, consider teaming up with a therapist who practices Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&mdash;which is basically replacing ineffective or destructive habits with new, more productive ones. As you shift into high gear&mdash;making better decisions, living more aligned with your values&mdash;you will gain the confidence you need to consistently make decisions that work for you.

When new hires are quickly brought up to speed on the corporate culture and introduced to colleagues, they&rsquo;ll feel comfortable and like they fit in from the start. Getting the tools and information they need to do their jobs also means they can begin actively contributing.&rdquo;</p><h3> The Disconnect</h3><p> <br/> HR's role in onboarding is making sure the new hire has completed the necessary paperwork and is familiar with the company's policies. The reason why HR managers believe their organization's onboarding process is effective is easy: they got the new hire to fill out and sign the paperwork.</p><p> But in actuality, the onboarding process falls on the shoulders of their direct managers. These are the people who are going to make sure the new hire has all of the necessary equipment, gets introduced to coworkers, and is shown the ropes around the company.</p><p> And that's the disconnect. HR managers believe onboarding is all about getting paperwork complete.

I advise my clients that realistically, they should expect a third of the buyers that submit indications of interest (&ldquo;IOIs&rdquo;) to drop off when asked to participate in more detailed discussions.</p><p> After receiving IOIs, I typically arrange for my client to meet with our four to six potential acquirers over the course of a week, with one or two meetings per day. Typically, buyers will bring several people to these meetings and the meetings will last three to four hours. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to see potential buyers bring investment professionals, operations people, and even lenders and other capital providers to these meetings.</p><p> While some sellers will make canned presentations at these meetings, I find that it is more useful to spend the time getting to know one another and letting the buyer ask questions. At this stage, these buyers have seen and studied the marketing package we provided earlier and have likely had at least one discussion with the ownership group as well as several detailed discussions with me. Consequently, the buyer should have a fairly good understanding of the potential opportunity and a canned presentation isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p><p> Most buyers will focus on the issues that are core to them at this stage. Most often, the meetings center around the ownership group&rsquo;s plans (for themselves and their business), the key risks inherent in the business, and the opportunities for the growth of the business. Also, the company&rsquo;s sustainability will ultimately be a key issue, so the buyers will want to know about the depth, strengths, and weaknesses of the management team.</p><p> Inevitably, the management meetings will result in the target buyers having a series of questions that they will need answered in order to fully analyze the value of the company and to prepare a thoughtful letter of intent. Since it is best for everyone to remove as many risks at this stage of the process, I usually expect that buyers will ask for one to two weeks downstream of the management meetings to get additional information from the company, do their own further background research, and ultimately prepare a letter of intent.</p><p> It is usually in your best interest to grant this additional time and to provide whatever reasonable information the buyers are looking for. It is crucial to eliminate as much obvious risk at this stage as possible, so that the rest of the transaction can go smoothly.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 17:19:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 17:19:17.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_Ash3C2d.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/meeting-potential-business-buyers/\", \"post_id\": \"5799\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 17:19:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 17:19:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"meeting-potential-business-buyers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5798\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2642\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/meeting-room-1-1232521-1279x852.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1335\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441107900,"author_id":345,"chart_url":""}

Find out below&hellip;Reputation management for medical practices is a hot topic right now, and one way to manage the practice reputation is through social media channels.  Many practices have been almost pushed into having Facebook pages, and so it&rsquo;s understandable that practice administrators and marketers need some help in managing those pages.Your medical practice stands to attract more patients and improve current patient relations by actively using social media. Take note of how these medical practices effectively use Facebook to boost business. How can use use what these practices are doing in their social media marketing?<h3> 1. Pediatric Associates Kansas City</h3>Kansas City pediatrician Natasha Burgert knows the importance of maintaining a strong online presence. The doctor launched a <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pediatric.Associates.Kansas.City\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook page for her practice </a></u> in 2009, and she posts from the page multiple times a day to retain followers. Dr. Burgert even started her own blog, <u> <a href=\"http://kckidsdoc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  KC Kids Doc </a></u>, and the <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kckidsdoc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook page of the blog </a></u> has an active following as well. The doctor and her husband, who is also a pediatrician at the practice, have successfully improved patient-doctor communication by staying active on social media.<h3> 2. Crystal Run Healthcare</h3>When it comes to large provider networks, <u> <a href=\"http://www.crystalrunhealthcare.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Crystal Run Healthcare </a></u> in Orange County, New York has proven its ability to network through Facebook. The provider network utilizes its <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CrystalRunHealthcare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook page </a></u> to drive traffic to its website and blog. Crystal Run Healthcare uses hashtags, carefully structured posts and relevant information that would apply to followers to boost business for its member practices.<h3> 3. Cooper University Health Care</h3>This <u> <a href=\"http://www.cooperhealth.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Camden, New Jersey-based hospital </a></u> uses its <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cooperuniversityhospital\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook </a></u> photo albums to highlight renovations and new equipment in offices throughout the hospital. You can do the same on a smaller scale. Providing images of your office allows prospective patients to envision what their experience with your practice will be like. You can also post photos of your physicians to build a rapport with patients before they even set foot in your office.<h3> Tips to Apply to Your Own Practice</h3>Do you want to use Facebook to your medical practice&rsquo;s advantage? Here are some tips from <u> <a href=\"https://www.physicianspractice.com/mobile/social-media-strategies-your-medical-practice\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Physicians Practice </a></u> to keep in mind:<li> Post about local events or fundraisers to remind followers that your practice prides itself on being part of the community. You will also gain exposure if you tag the Facebook page of the event you are mentioning.</li><li> Take the time to create an &ldquo;About&rdquo; section that utilizes local keywords.

{"original_id":2582,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Automated Call Answering Cuts Costs But Also Cuts Customers","link":"automated-call-answering-cuts-costs-but-also-cuts-customers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The size of a customer service department is, of course, directly related to the size of the business it is serving. A small company with only a limited number of customers will not have the same demands as a large one serving millions of people.For the latter, it can become a costly operation to build and manage a customer service team to deal with thousands of customer calls every single day. Many, in fact, choose to cut corners by installing things like automated call answering instead. This is when customers will initially speak to a robot who encourages you to press numbers to determine the nature of your enquiry and provide you with an answer, or at least redirection to the correct department best equipped to deal with your request.However, it shouldn&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise that cutting corners and cutting costs is likely to also cut into your customer satisfaction in a big way.  <u>  New research by alldayPA </u>  has found that over half of the people polled (55 per cent) would consider moving their custom elsewhere if a business treats their enquiries, complaints or troubleshooting requests with a robot rather than an actual human being. Even more &ndash; just over 70 per cent &ndash; said they would not choose a company if a human didn&rsquo;t answer when they were shopping around.From the one thousand people that were polled for the study, most people said that the automated answering service was at its most irritating when it was being used by professional services such as accountants and solicitors &ndash; companies where it is imperative that customers speak to human beings to discuss complex and often lengthy issues. The second most frustrating industry for customers to have to deal with automated machines is the travel businesses (travel agents, airlines, hotels, etc.)</p><h3> So what should companies be doing?</h3><strong> It&rsquo;s simple, really: get rid of those automated systems and make sure you have actual people on hand to answer your customers queries.</strong>Even if they aren&rsquo;t able to answer the queries immediately, just having a human voice instills a lot of confidence in the customer &ndash; 62 per cent of people say they would be happy to get transferred, receive a call-back later on or a reply by e-mail as long as they know their question is in the hands of a real person.A board executive from alldayPA, David Joseph, explained why not using automated services might be more costly on paper but is far more financially beneficial as a long term solution. He said: &ldquo;Automated call answering is often used by businesses in an attempt to save money, however such practices can often end up costing money in lost customers and sales.&rdquo;Take a look at this infographic for some more stats from AlldayPA.<a href=\"https://www.josephmichelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Automated-CS-Info.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.josephmichelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Automated-CS-Info.jpg \"/></a>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 17:24:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 17:24:45.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_qaVNVIA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/automated-call-answering-cuts-costs-but-also-cuts-customers/\", \"post_id\": \"5803\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 17:24:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 17:24:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"automated-call-answering-cuts-costs-but-also-cuts-customers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5802\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2644\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-31-at-10.31.34-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"576\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441130400,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2583,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Perfectly Positioned: 5 Habits of Great Rainmakers","link":"perfectly-positioned-5-habits-of-great-rainmakers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s true that the real rainmakers -- those few who are truly gifted at selling complex products or services &ndash; are naturally talented.</p><p> Many others -- the rest of us -- are perfectly capable of being wonderful business developers. The opportunity here is to take a look at what talented rainmakers do naturally, that can apply to others who want to sharpen their skills.</p><p> Working with and coaching a number of great sellers in and out of professional services over the years, I&rsquo;ve noticed five habits they have in common. They are certainly worthy of consideration for anyone in a position to sell &ndash; or be a business-building ambassador for &ndash; an organization with a more sophisticated product or service offer.</p><p> While all great sellers don&rsquo;t do each of these habits 100% (or 100% of the time), the more of each one they do, the higher the likelihood their numbers will be a happy thing.</p><h3> 1. Target Market &ldquo;Fit&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The degree to which your time / energy is a clear and publicly identifiable fit with your own (and your firm&rsquo;s) professional &ldquo;brand&rdquo; &ndash; in terms of expertise, network, personality, purpose, values, position, and distinctive public profile.</p><h3> 2. Blended Life</h3><p> <br/> The degree to which your personal contacts and activities are blended with your professional contacts and activities. You may say , &ldquo;So much for work / life balance, eh?&rdquo; But many great rainmakers don&rsquo;t see socializing with and involving potential clients in their lives as a task, they see it as a natural extension of their love for what they do.</p><h3> 3. Creating Opportunities versus Executing Deals</h3><p> <br/> The amount of time creating opportunities or paving the way for new deals versus executing them. Great rainmakers spend most of their time on originating business versus the nuts and bolts of memorializing the deal. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they set it up and let it go &ndash; since they maintain great relationships with their clients and prospects, they are can&rsquo;t help but stay updated and make sure whomever they&rsquo;ve turned to for execution is doing a great job. Yet they don&rsquo;t micromanage or dwell on the deals being done; they are on to the next one.</p><h3> 4. Effort Level</h3><p> <br/> The level amount of time and effort expended on business development &ndash; the more waking hours spent on building new business the better. Since great rainmakers tend to enjoy what they are doing (the thrill of the hunt, as it were), they have no problem spending much of their time on it in one form or another.</p><h3> 5. Rainmaker&rsquo;s Hearing</h3><p> <br/> The &ldquo;filter&rdquo; through which you are hearing any conversation. Even the most innocuous discussions can end up in the direction of business development.

Almost everyone does, including you.</p><p> Your estate is what you own. That includes your car, home, checking and savings accounts, investments, insurance, and personal possessions. And no matter the size of your estate, you can&rsquo;t take it with when you die.</p><p> What would happen to your assets if you were to pass away?</p><p> An estate plan helps answer this question. An estate plan is something that, upon your death, will guide the transfer your assets according to your wishes, minimize the transaction costs of transfer, provide liquid money for common costs, and protect and provide for loved ones.</p><p> Almost of all of us will need at least three things in an estate plan: a will, a durable power of attorney, and a living will. A will will dictate how your property is distributed and provide instructions for taking care of any minor children. A durable power of attorney helps someone make healthcare and property decisions when he or she is incapable of doing so alone. A living will contains your last wishes regarding sustaining life.</p><h3> I&rsquo;m A Millennial. Do I Really Need An Estate Plan?</h3><p> <br/> As someone in your 20s or 30s, you&rsquo;re probably focused on  <u>  living your best life now </u> . Estate planning might seem like something to tackle when you&rsquo;re older (or richer!). But if you have assets, and especially if you have anyone depending on you, you need to take care of this important financial planning task. An estate plan provides peace of mind that your loved ones are taken care of, even if the worst were to happen.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t have your affairs in order, the processing of your estate will be dictated by state law &mdash; and you might not like the result. Probate laws vary from state to state, but the unintended consequences could include:</p><li> Single: A court-dictated property distribution, even for pets</li><li> Married: Some states dictate sharing of property between parents and siblings.</li><li> Married with children: Some states automatically give a part of your estate to both your spouse and your children. If you have 5 kids, it could be that only 12% of your estate would go to your spouse. That money might not be enough to live on. Plus, many people prefer for their spouse to have more control to provide for the children in the best way they see fit. If both parents pass away before establishing a guardian, the care and custody of your children will be up to the courts.</li><li> Married to a non-US citizen spouse: If your spouse isn&rsquo;t a U.S. citizen, he or she could face an estate tax. This applies even to permanent residents. A trust will be needed in this case.</li><li> Own Property in Multiple States: Your assets will go through probate court in multiple states. That&rsquo;s costly and time-consuming for surviving family or friends. <br/>  </li><p> This is just an introduction into the complexity of the probate system. Many other situations &mdash; like those of a  <u>  business owner </u> , blended family, or a family with a special needs child &mdash; will benefit greatly from an established estate plan.</p><p> Given the choice, wouldn&rsquo;t you rather your estate be handled by your family &mdash; not the courts &mdash; in the way you see fit? Probate does provide a legal, open way to administer an estate. But it&rsquo;s costly, complex, and it takes a long time. Make an estate plan to simplify the process for your family.</p><h3> Get Started Now</h3><p> <br/> No one likes to think about their own death or disability. That&rsquo;s why so many families are unprepared when the worst does happen. The best time to start is now. Even if money is tight, you can keep the costs in line by starting with the basics. Your estate plan can evolve over time.</p><p> So how do you take the next step?</p><p> You might be considering using one of those legal sites online. Most likely, it&rsquo;s not  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/09/legal-diy-websites-are-no-match-for-a-pro/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   worth the money  </a> </u> . Estate planning is very complex, and it varies from state to state. The document might not hold up in a court of law. You might as well save your money and put it towards the cost of an estate attorney.</p><p> Look for an estate attorney licensed in your area. Consider asking a financial advisor or a CPA for a few recommendations of good estate lawyers.  Interview a few lawyers, and you&rsquo;ll find the one that&rsquo;s right for you.</p><p> Take the first step towards putting an estate plan in place today. It&rsquo;s not fun or easy, but it&rsquo;s a great boon to your loved ones if the worst were to happen.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 17:54:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 17:54:31.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_ZxnUlKO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-case-for-millennials-to-have-a-plan/\", \"post_id\": \"5807\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 17:54:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 17:54:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-case-for-millennials-to-have-a-plan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5806\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2646\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/city-night-evening-canal-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"544\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441134000,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}

Besides, I do not want to be one of those people who tweets about my activities in a Starbucks&rsquo; line!&rdquo;</p><p> Yes, I said it. It was sometime in 2013 and I was working with my branding partner, the amazing  <u>  Emily Aiken </u> . Emily had shared her vision of the rebranding of my company and we were discussing my use of social media as a tool. I was sure I had all the answers; after all I had put several minutes into my study of social media in order to come up with this powerful conclusion, a conclusion that was about to change. It changed when Emily shared this statement: &ldquo;You know, for someone who is an expert on change, you sure do not seem open to trying something new like social media.&rdquo; It was a kick in the gut; and a kick that I needed.</p><p> I realized that what I had when it came to social media was a whole bunch of assessments. In my world, as a coach, we define an assessment as an opinion, verdict, or judgment that can never be proven true or false. People often make assessments based on a murky or arbitrary standard. Let&rsquo;s look at my assessments around social media. I had created the opinion that using social media would be a waste of my time, that there was little good that could come of it. All of the above were simply my opinions, they were neither true nor false, but I was living them as if they were true. I had never actually stopped and tested the standards I felt validated my assessment. I had never actually used Twitter and explored its ability to connect me with other people. I had simply made up a story, a story that allowed me to continue in my negative assessment. Instead of my having my assessments, they had me. That is the power of assessments, they create the boundaries in a person&rsquo;s world, whether they are valid or not. In my case, they allowed me to play small in business and not put my company out there, to not take a risk.</p><p> Now, assessments are not a bad thing. For instance, what time did you get up this morning? You likely got up at a time that allowed you to get to work or the gym on time. How did you know what time to get up? Well you had to make an assessment. You judged that to get to the gym on time in the morning you had to wake up at 5:30 so that you could be at the Crossfit class by six. Assessments allow us to navigate the world, the challenge is to be aware that they are simply assessments and that we need to make sure we are not living them as truths and closing off possibilities. So the next time you have an opinion or a judgment that is not grounded in fact, that can&rsquo;t be proven against a defined standard, take the time to see if you have an assessment &ndash; or if your assessment has you. As for me, I need to go check in on Twitter and continue my conversations, after all, my new assessment is that social media is fun.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 17:57:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 17:57:00.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_382nen3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-have-your-assessment-or-does-it-have-you/\", \"post_id\": \"5809\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 17:57:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 17:57:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-have-your-assessment-or-does-it-have-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5808\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2647\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Assessments-Old-Lock-800x390.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"802\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441134900,"author_id":120,"chart_url":""}

With physical assets this isn&rsquo;t much of a problem but when it comes to digital assets, you certainly have an issue. Why? Because you can&rsquo;t touch them, can&rsquo;t file them, and you certainly can&rsquo;t move them. Well, technically you can move them, but they are not yours to control. Let&rsquo;s take a Twitter account as an example. Twitter is without a doubt one of the greatest platforms for digital advertising. You can use it to spread the word of your products and services very easily, and you can even text to mobile phones if the user/customer opts in.</p><p> What happens, however, when the individual who made the Twitter account leaves the company, taking the login information with them? This is where proper  <strong>  digital asset management  </strong> comes into play, and with it comes several different responsibilities. The first, is making sure that you are covered before the creation of any social media accounts go forward.</p><h3> Cover Yourself and Your Accounts</h3><p> <br/> How important is it to cover yourself and your accounts? To answer this, think about the number of followers a social media account can accumulate  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   over a short period of time  </a> </u> . How will you use those assets to your advantage? With the vast majority of customers and potential customers online these days, the internet remains your best means to reach them with new products and changes to your company, with social media being the best platform to do so with. So, there are a few things that you should ensure before you launch any sort of social media campaign.</p><li> Specify in any contracts that social media accounts belong to the company</li><li> Secure all passwords</li><li> Monitor all content sent from the company account <br/>  </li><p> These three items can easily change the way you view and control your social media accounts, and as always it would be a good idea to take any additional concerns up with your legal representative. The most important thing that you can do is make it clear to your employees and even potential employees that any social media accounts used by the company, even if made BY the employee are the property of the company. This might seem like an unnecessary step and even a supplement to common sense, but it is more important than you realize. There are a  <u>  plethora of cases </u>  in the court system at this very moment that address this precise situation. More than a few employees have &lsquo;run off&rsquo; with social media accounts, and some of these employees have actually managed to win the rights to keep their accounts.</p><p> Such a thing can be a serious blow to any company, and you will want to make sure that yours does not fall victim to it. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-08-31 18:00:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-08-31 18:00:55.000000","image_url":"2015/8/article_placeholder_daw72FP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/digital-asset-management-personal-vs-company/\", \"post_id\": \"5811\", \"post_date\": \"2015-08-31 18:00:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-08-31 18:00:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"digital-asset-management-personal-vs-company\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5810\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2648\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/man-notes-macbook-computer-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"714\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441104300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2587,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Accelerate Your Business with Document Management","link":"how-to-accelerate-your-business-with-document-management","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Since it was founded in 1990, Gitterman &amp; Associates Wealth Management, LLC has grown from a five-person financial firm to a dually registered firm with 25 employees handling $225M assets under management (AUM) on its RIA side and over $400M AUM on its broker-dealer (BD) side. With this growth came the need to manage more client information and business records&mdash;and, now as a dually registered RIA/BD, to meet separate compliance standards for both FINRA and the SEC.</p><p> Since implementing Laserfiche Avante earlier this year, Gitterman &amp; Associates is not only saving the staff and storage costs of working with paper, the firm is using Laserfiche to proactively manage its information to make compliance simpler, easier and more efficient. &ldquo;Laserfiche is as user-friendly as it says it is, but it has the flexibility to separate our information to meet our compliance needs as both an RIA and a broker-dealer,&rdquo; says Jeffrey Gitterman, Founder and CEO. &ldquo;No other company or solution we looked at did that.&rdquo;</p><h3> Declaring Independence from Its BD &ndash; and Its Legacy ECM</h3><p> <br/> Laserfiche was not the firm&rsquo;s first enterprise content management (ECM) solution&mdash;but it was its first successful one. &ldquo;Two years ago, our broker-dealer at the time came to us as one of two branch offices to beta test their document management system. I jumped on it, thinking this has got to be better than having a file clerk in a room all day,&rdquo; recalls Marcy Gitterman, Director of IT &amp; HR.</p><p> Trouble was, with no folder hierarchy and searching limited only to template fields, the legacy system was creating as many problems as it was meant to solve. &ldquo;It was just a really cumbersome program to use,&rdquo; she says. As the firm prepared to switch broker-dealers to Fidelity, only one of 19 staff members had actually scanned their paperwork into the system. Marcy was frustrated, but optimistic. &ldquo;I knew there had to be something else out there that would work,&rdquo; she says.</p><p> The firm&rsquo;s principals, meanwhile, just wanted something people would actually use. &ldquo;At one point, we were just talking about scanning everything to PDF ourselves and storing it on a hard drive, but I was really against that,&rdquo; Gitterman says. &ldquo;We needed something a lot more robust&mdash;the fact that PDFs can be altered wouldn&rsquo;t help with security or compliance.&rdquo;</p><p> Laserfiche, turns out, was one of the ECM providers on Fidelity&rsquo;s short list of recommended solutions. Jeffrey Gitterman was aware of Laserfiche from local FPA chapter meetings, as well as from hearing about it from colleagues who used it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a name we kept hearing a lot,&rdquo; he says. When Zaheer Master, President of Laserfiche reseller Accelerated Information Systems, presented a Laserfiche solution tailored to the firm&rsquo;s dual registry, Gitterman knew he was working with the right company&mdash;and that he&rsquo;d actually use the software.</p><p> &ldquo;I avoid technology like the plague, so ease of use was my number one priority. How easily can our new employees use it? How easy is it for me to use it?&rdquo; Gitterman says. &ldquo;Laserfiche could take our paper filing system&mdash;the one we&rsquo;ve been using successfully since 1996&mdash;and transpose it to a Windows-type environment we were comfortable with.</p><p> &ldquo;But what really impressed us about Laserfiche was the way our reseller presented it. The other solutions we looked at were totally reactionary&mdash;they just said, &lsquo;This is how you get rid of paper.&rsquo; Our reseller presented Laserfiche in a way that said, &lsquo;Okay, now that your information&rsquo;s automated, here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;ll need to set this up to get the most out of it and here&rsquo;s how you do it,&rsquo;&rdquo; he adds.</p><p> Implementation took place over two months. Says Master, &ldquo;We showed them how they needed to separate the RIA side of their business from the BD side for FINRA and SEC compliance. We also showed them how, using metadata, you could set up a template field search with a cut-off date or destruction date to easily enforce a retention policy. I think the important thing to realize with ECM is that just because it&rsquo;s easy to keep everything, doesn&rsquo;t mean you necessarily want to.&rdquo;</p><p> The space saving alone, Marcy says, was a relief. &ldquo;We look at the hundreds of square feet we&rsquo;d been devoting to our file room&mdash;it just gets crazy. And half of those files you&rsquo;ll never see, but you have to keep for compliance,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Now we get our space back and all we have to do is shoot something through the scanner so we don&rsquo;t have to touch it again. It&rsquo;s that simple.&rdquo;</p><p> The flexibility to segregate information and customize user access to certain folders was not only effective, she says, it was easy. &ldquo;In the old system, we would have to hire a support person to do that. Now we can set up permissions to assign access,&rdquo; Marcy says. &ldquo;We use Laserfiche for client files, HR files, benefits, payroll, you name it, so the ability to lock down some files versus other files is really helpful.&rdquo;</p><p> She adds, &ldquo;Laserfiche doesn&rsquo;t just say it&rsquo;s user friendly, it is.&rdquo;</p><h3> Automated Compliance &ndash; Even at 2 AM</h3><p> <br/> While having more accessible information is a benefit, Gitterman &amp; Associates has also realized that automated information is more useful information. &ldquo;We do a lot of our compliance right in Laserfiche,&rdquo; Marcy says. &ldquo;Instead of our reps having to make copies of client correspondence, they scan them in and it&rsquo;s automatically submitted to our Chief Compliance Officer in a folder only he has access to. Then we set up a stamping process so the CCO can tell the rep that it&rsquo;s been approved.&rdquo;</p><p> This automation has paid off in faster service for financial advisors. &ldquo;One of the nice things is that if our CCO is on the road, it&rsquo;s not like it has to wait a week if it&rsquo;s something that needs to be pre-approved. He doesn&rsquo;t have to look for a fax machine or find time to respond during business hours, he can just log into Laserfiche at 2:00 AM.&rdquo;</p><p> For his part, Jeffrey agrees. &ldquo;Laserfiche is a huge help from a compliance side.&rdquo;</p><p> But Gitterman says it&rsquo;s the little things that make using Laserfiche an effective part of everyday business. &ldquo;The fact that I can redact a line in a memo, and then send it in a secure email&mdash;these are the kinds of things I like. I don&rsquo;t have to ask someone how to do it, I can just do it.&rdquo;</p><p> He sees the potential for Laserfiche to make audits more hassle-free. &ldquo;I just went through six months of FINRA audits and I can tell you it was painful. They basically put me out of business for six months. If we had already had Laserfiche, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a tenth of the nightmare it was,&rdquo; he says.</p><p> &ldquo;Now that we have Laserfiche, even though an auditor can come and say he wants to see incoming correspondence from a certain date range, we can have everything for them in 30 seconds. That&rsquo;s going to be huge for us.&rdquo;</p><p> Marcy says now that the firm is enjoying its first taste of content management efficiency, she is eager to see what Laserfiche Workflow can do to automate business process management. &ldquo;Right now our CRM integrates with our email system&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to see it integrated with Laserfiche as well,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And our internal processing department will be able to automatically route documents to our principals to approve from anywhere, instead of having them wait in a folder on a desk&mdash;that&rsquo;ll be nice.&rdquo;</p><p> As nice, says Jeffrey, is that the firm has found an ECM system that&rsquo;s finally living up to its potential&mdash;and uncovering new potential in the process. &ldquo;Of all the new software we&rsquo;ve gotten in the last few months, this is everyone&rsquo;s favorite,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Laserfiche did what it promised to do. None of the other software did.&rdquo;</p><p> Are you interested in how to select a document management system that will make audits a breeze?

We were about an hour into the flight, and up until then, neither of us had said a word&ndash; and quite frankly, we both seemed just fine with that. #thankgoodnesswegotpastthatWhen I apologized and tried to recover the paper that was all over his feet and lap (#nexttimeuseabinderclip), he just seemed annoyed. Now, I know he was processing. A few minutes after my scramble, he said softly, &ldquo;you writing a book?&rdquo;Now, as you can imagine, there&rsquo;s nothing a woman like me wants to talk about more during this frantic final editing journey than my book.  In fact, when I check out at the grocery store and they say &ldquo;paper or plastic,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m inclined to tell them &ldquo;I like paper because it reminds me of my book which will also be available in kindle, which I guess, is kind-of like plastic.&rdquo;<h3> I lit up past the embarrassment.</h3>&ldquo;Why, yes, I am. How could you tell?&rdquo; I smiled, glad to have finally connected past the scramble.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo;  I launched into the Cliff&rsquo;s notes version of Winning Well and getting results without losing your soul. (Hmmm&hellip; I wonder how I get Cliff to cover Winning Well. No, no, that would be a tragedy).&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s awesome.&rdquo; He shared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing a talk at my daughter&rsquo;s work next month. I&rsquo;m trying to pick up everything I can about leadership. I&rsquo;ve been watching TED talks. Trying to nail down my ideas.&rdquo;I jotted down his email, promised to send resources, and started to ask questions about the nature of his talk.Imagine how surprised I was to find I was talking to <u> <a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/gregory.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  Frederick Gregory </a></u>, astronaut and a NASA senior administrator who led the International management team responsible for the International Space Station (among other significant leadership feats and awards).More to come on my new friend Fred. We&rsquo;re connecting again later this week.For now I&rsquo;ll leave you with this piece of advice.<h3> The biggest life and leadership lessons come when you&rsquo;re surprised.</h3>Think about it. when you go on vacation, what stories do you tell when you get back home. The times when everything went just as planned? Or the more awkward moments, like when you had to ski down the blacks with your baby on your back because you made a wrong turn (been there), or followed your GPS only to find &ldquo;you have arrived&rdquo; put you deep into a dead-end of a National forest (#myweekend).How we react, and what we do during the times of biggest surprise are the moments that most shape us.Astronaut Gregory shared how surprised he was to find that the Russians he was working with during that tense time had some of the same childhood experiences as he, hearing a siren and being instructed to climb under the desk to practice in case the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; attacked. &ldquo;Oh, we thought YOU were the bad guys.&rdquo;Being open to the surprise of common experiences helps us accelerate understanding and facilitate identification of a common goal.When we&rsquo;re so sure in what we know&ndash; when we let confidence trump humility&ndash; we lose the ability to learn from surprise. We can&rsquo;t win well from that space.Imagine the power of beginning each day looking forward to something that will surprise us, and expand our perspective.<strong> Your turn.

{"original_id":2589,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The State of Digital, Fintech and the Future Bank","link":"the-state-of-digital-fintech-and-the-future-bank","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I was recently interviewed by Emerging Markets Review just before travelling to Korea in July.  The interview lasted a while, but stunned me when they produced the magazine with yours truly front page and centre.  Rather than saying anything more, here's the interview which you can  <a href=\"http://www.miraeasset.com/export/sites/com.miraeasset.www/_galleries/download/em-insights-magazine/2015Q3/Story_01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  download as a PDF </a>  if you prefer.</p><p> <strong>  The global financial industry is experiencing new innovation and Fin-tech is taking its center recently. Could you define Fin-tech in your own words? It must be much more complicated than simply saying &lsquo;payment by mobile phone&rsquo;. </strong></p><p> Fintech is the integration of finance and technology.  For most, it means making the financial markets internet-ready, as many bank and insurance systems were built before the internet was invented or without a consideration of customers accessing those systems directly through the internet 24*7.</p><p> <strong>  IT companies used to be providers (or supporters) of technical method for financial companies, such as e-banking and mobile-banking for banks. Now more IT companies are entering the financial business on their own to meet customer&rsquo;s needs directly. What triggers do you think have made the IT companies to change? What differentiations and strengths do you think IT companies have in financial business in this new era? </strong></p><p> Financial companies are becoming IT companies and IT companies are becoming financial companies.  This is exactly due to the answer before &ndash; Fintech integrates finance and technology.  But there&rsquo;s more to this than that basic statement as two specific technologies are changing the game, and I call this the internet of value or the ValueWeb if you prefer (the title of my next book).  The ValueWeb allows anyone, anywhere to exchange value with anyone else, anywhere else, in real-time for almost free.  Historically, banks have created systems that are slow.  An international payment takes days to process for that reason.  But mobile has changed all of this.  Mobile technologies and specifically the mobile internet, are allowing all of us to connect directly through the network one-to-one with each other.  In other words, seven billion people living on Earth can create electronic connections with each other today.  Once you do that, you can exchange information and build relationships and, most importantly, trade.  However, you cannot trade if it is expensive to pay, and so the ValueWeb creates new ways to pay.  In particular, it needs to have a way to pay that is cheap and real-time, not expensive and slow.  That is why the development of bitcoin and the blockchain has been transformational.  The blockchain will allow anyone, anywhere to transfer value globally to someone else for almost free, in real-time, because it is an internet ledger of transactions that is trusted and free.  This technology is now being built into the banking system by companies like Ripple, Eris and Erethreum, and will soon be the de facto way to pay.</p><p> This is why the two technologies of mobile and blockchain are the drivers for the Fintech revolution.  By way of example, in 2014 $13.2 billion was invested in Fintech startups by venture capital funds.  In 2013, it was $4 billion and before less than a billion.  Why would VCs invest so much?  Because they can see the returns.   In 2014, there were 36 new Fintech startups like Lending Club, Stripe, <a href=\"https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Funding Circle  </u> </a> and Square, with over a billion dollar valuations.  The year before, only 12 and next year probably over 100.  These new companies are using the mobile internet to create new peer-to-peer connections for crowdfunding and lending and new payments systems through technologies from APIs (Application Program Interfaces) to the blockchain.  In fact, a third of the Fintech firms are focused upon P2P value connections like Zopa and TransferWise whilst a third are focused upon payments like Klarna and Traxpay.  These firms are really changing the game and the result is that banks will lose money.  A Goldman Sachs report on the future of finance published in the first quarter estimates that banks will lose over $10 billion of profitability &ndash; about 20% of the market &ndash; in the credit line of business alone over the next few years as customers defect to peer-to-peer lenders like ppdai and Alibaba, so this is critical changes to the financial system.</p><br /><p> <strong>  Then what kind of future are the traditional financial companies facing? As stated in your book &lt;Digital Bank: Strategies to Launch or Become a Digital Bank&gt;, it can be not only crisis but also opportunity for them. What differentiated strengths can they exert under the new circumstance that digitized financial services are deeply into our everyday lives? What new format of financial service can they provide to customers? </strong></p><p> Traditional financial firms have a problem, in that they were built in the last century and focused upon the physical distribution of paper through a localised network focused upon buildings and human hands; the new players are focused upon the digital distribution of data through a globalised network focused upon software and servers.  The difference is that the new players can transact the same services &ndash; loans, mortgages, insurance, wealth management, investments, payments &ndash; at a fraction of the cost of the old, as a result.  The old companies cannot compete with the new if their cost models are ten times more expensive because of their many buildings and staff structures.   So they have to move rapidly from physical to digital. </p><p> Moving to digital is not simple however.  For many financial firms it means ripping out their current systems that were built for physical operations and replacing them with digital structures that are internet-enabled.  Even if that is done, it means going one step further and changing management and leadership to get digital.  I often say that banks are led by leaders who delegate digital to function or person &ndash; the Head of Digital.  How can you delegate the future of the bank?  You can&rsquo;t is the answer.  So the leadership team must start with digital as their focal area, and the change management to become digital at their core.</p><p> That is tough, as it means a key understanding of building financial systems and structures where digital internet services are the core of the firm, and humans and buildings sit upon those digital foundations. Too often, I hear firms that talk about channels and functions, and realise that their thinking is that digital is being added to their buildings and humans as an overlay.  It is completely wrong thinking, as digital firms think digital first and then work out what buildings and humans need to sit upon that digital structure.</p><p> This is the reason that I can only name a few firms that think this way.  Digital titans are obvious &ndash; Alibaba, TenCent.  Digital financial firms are not so obvious but a few are out there &ndash; mBank in Poland, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ICICI Bank in India &ndash; but they are few and far between, and even these banks are not truly digital yet, e.g. do they have internet-enabled core systems that are enterprise wide and can provide a single view of the customer?  Not all of them, and this is key in the digital age where customers expect and demand one-to-one personalised digital service. </p><p> <strong>  For China, Eastern Europe and Africa, it is said that low rates in credit card use and underdevelopment of financial service infrastructure naturally lead to the successful development and growth of Fin-tech in the region. However, in Korea, general people use credit cards to pay and have easy access to ATMs, and internet banking and stock investment are more common. Do you believe the expansion of Fin-tech and digitized technology is still an inevitable path in the countries like Korea, where financial service infrastructure is already well established? </strong></p><p> Well Fintech is going to adapt and change everything everywhere, based upon the mobile and value exchange technology of the blockchain I&rsquo;ve described.  In developed markets like Korea, you will see similar changes to those I see in Japan, Europe and America vis-&agrave;-vis direct peer-to-peer payments, funding and credit.  More intriguing in some ways, are the developments we are seeing in China, Eastern Europe and Africa.  These economies are still developing, as you mention, and a key here is financial inclusion.  There are five billion people who have no banking or are underbanked today.  They have been excluded from the system in the past because to service them was too expensive.  Building branches in areas where people are poor and there&rsquo;s no profit to be made didn&rsquo;t&rsquo; make sense.  However now, through the mobile internet and blockchain, seven billion people are being connected to an electronic system that is cheap, easy and real-time.  That means that the whole planet will be able to communicate and trade one-to-one.  Goat farmers in Ethiopia will be able to sell goat products &ndash; leather hides or crafts made from goat hide &ndash; to Korean buyers via QQ pages, Wechat photos, text messaged payments and Alipay logistics.  That is an amazing new world and amazing new concept.  Everyone on this planet can buy and sell anything with anyone, anywhere.</p><p> So the whole concept of how we live on this planet changes with it.  That will be as transformational in Seoul, where people will be connected to things they never thought of connecting with before, as it is in London, Paris, Mumbai, New York, Tokyo and Shanghai.</p><p> <strong>  Welcoming gestures from individual customer and investor are more triggering the popularity of Fin-tech. What factors and aspects of the Fin-tech do you think are attracting people? What kind of merits and values can people expect from it, from the perspective of the customer, and investor? </strong></p><p> There are three fundamental pieces to Fintech which the firms that are winning understand: connectivity, simplification and personalisation.</p><p> Connectivity allows anyone to trade with anyone, anywhere.  Simplification takes away the old complexities of markets and makes them easy by dealing with just a small part of that market.  For example, for many Fintech companies they are just taking one process &ndash; lending, paying, buying, investing &ndash; and making that one piece simple.  That is what is different is that they are simplifying the basics of finance, not trying to be all things to all people which is what traditional firms have been.  It&rsquo;s a little like the Uber&rsquo;s or Alibaba&rsquo;s who provide platforms to connect people who need to get from A to B or who need to buy something with people who have a car or the product you need.  These middle ground intermediaries act as the global or regional or national data hubs to connect the person who needs something with the person who has it, direct, one-to-one through software and servers.  That&rsquo;s what the simplification game is all about.</p><p> Finally, there&rsquo;s personalisation which then becomes the differentiation.  Personalisation is all about making sure you remember what the individual did last time to make it easier for them to do next time and, for the data intermediary, that&rsquo;s easy as they&rsquo;ve got the data.  Airbnb, Facebook, Google or whoever, know where you stayed, what you posted or searched for last time, and therefore just make it easier and easier each time you touch their service by repeated and simplifying that process on a personalised basis.  That&rsquo;s what banks and insurers need to do: connect, simplify and repeat by making it personal.  These are the basics of attracting and retaining the customer in the digital age, and are the reasons why you and I always go back to Tencent and Alibaba.</p><p> <strong>  What changes in individual&rsquo;s investment behavior and practice do you think would be made by the development of Fin-tech (or digitized financial services)? </strong></p><p> We are already seeing massive changes in customer behaviour.  Just look at the Tencent versus Wechat battle over red letter messages at Chinese New Year.  If you&rsquo;re not aware, the incentivisation to exchange small gifts of money via mobile led to STATS.  Similarly, when Alibaba launched their investment fund, millions of dollars flowed from other accounts into the fund because Alibaba is trusted, prolific and believed.</p><p> These are the factors that are changing people&rsquo;s behaviours incredibly fast.  I mean, banks believe they are trusted, but what about the internet giants?  Are they not trusted?  Do we not trust Google to find us the right search results?   Do we not trust Facebook to store our memories?  Do we not trust Alibaba to deliver the goods?</p><p> We trust these brands because they deliver, consistently and right first time, every time.  And if they don&rsquo;t deliver, they say sorry; a word we rarely hear from a bank.</p><p> So behaviours are changing real fast and if a bank or insurance company believes they can rely on trust then they are seriously delusional.</p><p> <strong>  There are worries on the bubble and risk that Fin-tech might bring. Crowd-funding and P2P lending service, for example, have negative potential that could damage the participant&rsquo;s asset and security when regulation and supervision process are incomplete and they are not well-managed. What is your view on the side effects, negative potential and risk that the digitized financial technology would bring? </strong></p><p> Right now, there&rsquo;s a lot of downside to the Fintech bubble. People are starting to trust brands that are unregulated and are not aware of the risks.  MtGox is a great example.  MtGox was viewed as  a store of value by many, and they assumed that their value store was guaranteed.  It wasn&rsquo;t, and when MtGox went under, thousands of bitcoin investors went bust.  MtGox lost $500 million in investments with no recourse, guarantee or reimbursement.</p><p> That&rsquo;s just plain wrong, and it&rsquo;s why financial markets are regulated.  Banks and insurance companies work hard at compliance, audit and regulation because it is compliance, audit and regulation that gives them their licence to provide a store of value.  I find it hard to believe that consumers don&rsquo;t understand this, but maybe because it is not clear and underscored.  If you store your savings in an internet brand, because you like that brand, you have zero guarantee of your money being safe.  If it&rsquo;s lost, screw you.  Tough.  It was your fault for being stupid and storing it there.</p><p> This is a criticality in understanding the difference between the Fintech guys who claim you don&rsquo;t need banks and insurers anymore, and the reality.  You need the financial system to provide stability and confidence.  Without it, you have nothing.</p><p> <strong>  For emerging countries, I am wondering if you would agree to when the convenience of fintech  is combined with the increase of the middle - income bracket, it would lead to substantial growth in consumption and investment into the region. If so, what kind of technology and business capability should be ready for companies that plan to penetrate emerging markets or local companies in the region to be benefited from the consumption and investment growth? </strong></p><p> For emerging economies, the two technologies that are transformational are mobile and blockchain.  Mobile provides inclusion for everyone cheaply and easily.  Blockchain provides the transmittance of value cheaply and easily via mobile in real-time.  This is why these two technologies will rapidly upscale these economies because suddenly those who have no access to financial transactions or markets, can transact and play.  A person who has an idea, a craft, an ability, anything can transact now with anyone and sell that idea, craft or ability.  You could never do this before because that idea, craft or ability was limited to the locality of your community.  Many people in that locality would know about that idea, craft or ability.  They might even buy it once, but that was seriously limiting, as the idea, craft or ability could be sold many times &hellip; if only people knew about it.  That is the transformation of mobile and blockchain.  Anyone, anywhere now has the ability to sell any idea, craft or ability to anyone else, anywhere else on this planet.  That is incredible and amazing and is unlimited by the banking system or even the governance system. It is why Dee Hock, the founder or Visa, describes the blockchain as the future of not only payments, but of governance.  This is it.  It is here and now.  We have connected the planet.  This is amazing, so get with the program and work out how your institution, company, competency and capability can play a part in this transformation or be excluded and die.</p><p> <strong>  Could you propose &lsquo;three keywords&rsquo; that financial market player facing digital industrial revolution bear in mind to be the market leader? </strong></p><p> Core, humans and culture.   I would stop there but that is not clear. Financial Services institutions must first create a digital core.  They then need to work out what role people play in supporting that core by, for example, engaging in customer relationships through remote digital outreach via social media.  Then, if they are using social media, they must have a culture whereby the humans understand how to build relationships through digital outreach.  Can you really be relevant to your target audience on their QQ page?  That&rsquo;s the key.  Core, humans and culture.</p><p> <strong>  What are your thoughts on physical-digital coexistence? </strong></p><p> Let's start answering this question by saying that most people are not talking physical and digital, but physical and digital channels. It depresses me that we still talk about channels, as I&rsquo;ve blogged often, as surely it&rsquo;s now just physical and digital.  Channels implies multiple digital services, rather than just digital and physical.  That&rsquo;s why I hate the word or thought or focus upon channels in discussing Fintech.  Channels means multiple, separate digital structures.</p><p> So then we get into physical and digital coexistence and, for the next ten years, we will be working more and more on making these things seamlessly integrated and easy.  The internet of things and robots, infomediaries and robo-advisers, will make life simpler and easier from a financial perspective.  As these things develop, we will be paying and transacting seamlessly and easily everywhere, all the time.</p><p> The result of these activities is that, over time, we will not even be thinking physical and digital, just life.  Life augmented by digital platforms that make our lives easier.  Our physical existence is simplified as we no longer have to consider paying for anything.  We just live and consume and receive by exchanging debits and credits occur through the air.</p><p> <strong>  How do you reconcile emerging, disruptive financial services players with an environment of increased governance and regulatory oversight? </strong></p><p> Governance and regulation is intriguing, and always a subject that is high on the agenda of financiers, as they have so much governance and regulatory oversight.   The emerging, disruptive players have no oversight, as they are creating new value exchange models.  However, as those models evolve, the regulators get involved.  We&rsquo;re seeing this right now with bitcoin and the blockchain, and we&rsquo;ve seen it before in any market that involves financial exchange.  A great example is peer-to-peer lending, where most governments are learning. As they learn, they understand and, as they understand, they work out that these markets need their own specific style of regulatory oversight and governance.   In the UK for example, we now have P2P regulations and P2P governance through the Financial Conduct Authority.  So the idea of financial services without regulation is plain stupid.  Financial services, and therefore all the disruptive new financial players, will always be regulated or shut down.</p><p> <strong>  Are we going through a Fintech bubble and when will it burst? </strong></p><p> Yes, we are going through a bubble but it won&rsquo;t burst for some time, as there&rsquo;s a long way to go.  We are seeing just a few players emerge with new models so far.  In payments, the likes of Square, Klarna, Stripe, Currency Cloud and TransferWise have emerged as potentially major and massive heavyweights in transferring value.   In lending, Lending Club, Prosper, Kabbage, Zopa, Funding Circle and more are all emerging as major new credit companies.  In fact, of the $13.2 billion invested in Fintech startups last year ($4 billion the year before, under a billion in 2012), two-thirds is being invested in payments and lending.  As a result, Goldman Sachs have forecast a fifth of bank profits disappearing in these areas to the new players within five years.  That&rsquo;s the reason why VC&rsquo;s are investing and it&rsquo;s not so much a bubble as building a new Fintech marketplace.</p><p> <strong>  Many of the success stories for digital financial services are consumer/retail oriented. How are will digital impact institutional business outside of improved risk and compliance capabilities? </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s a false illusion to think it&rsquo;s just consumer and retail, but the media and commentators, including myself, focus on these areas as they are easier to digest and discuss.  However, if you look at commercial and investment banking then everything from Traxpay to eToro to Colored Coins to Ripple to Betterment to Nutmeg to Secondmarket and more are ripping through those markets.  In fact, Fintech and cryptocurrencies is as if not more transformational in investment markets than in retail.  Just look at low latency, high frequency trading and BATS Chi-X, if you want to see the impact there.</p><p> <strong>  Which segment should be a focus for digital for traditional financial players: wealth, business or consumer markets? </strong></p><p> This is a question for your own company, not for me.  You need to work out where your core competency lies, and then leverage and focus upon it.  The problem most banks and financial firms have is that they&rsquo;ve been trying to grow for the past twenty years from being monoline players to being universal financial firms.   That trend is reversing fast as Fintech companies are predominantly very narrow.   They&rsquo;re not even monoline, as they don&rsquo;t cover the whole line; they&rsquo;re more monoparts.  You cannot compete as a universal player against a specialist monopart, so you have to integrate the parts that are better than yours and combine that part with your core competency.  Is your core competency wealth, business   or retail focused?  That will then answer this question, as the other parts that you&rsquo;re not good at, you need to partner or purchase.</p><p> <strong>  Is there an institution you see doing many things right? Who are they and how are they moving where others aren't? </strong></p><p> Well the one I keep coming back to because it showed commitment is mBank in Poland.  What is commitment?  The chicken participates in breakfast, the pig is committed.  That&rsquo;s commitment.  Most institutions participate and play with the idea of digital.  They are not committed.  They run pilot programs and tests.  They don&rsquo;t bet the bank but mBank did just that.</p><p> mBank is actually a company called BRE Bank, a bank that had operated in Poland since 1985.  BRE Bank launched the first internet banking platform, which they called mBank, in 2000.  They were seen as the market leader for innovation back then, and gained a lot of popularity.  Then, in 2009, Alior Bank launched Alior Bank Sync, a cool social mobile app.  BRE Bank looked old and slow, and lost customers to Alior Bank as a result, bearing in mind that BRE Bank had been the technology market leader as the first internet bank in Poland.  So the CEO took a really brave decision and decided to relaunch BRE Bank as a digital bank.  He brought in a new digital leader from Microsoft, invested heavily in a development of a new mobile, social bank platform and launched this platform in summer 2013.</p><p> Now, the reason this impresses me most is not because the bank launched a digital bank service but because they threw away their 30 year old bank brand.  They got rid of the BRE Bank brand and launched anew as mBank.  All the branches were rebranded &ndash; the ones they kept &ndash; and the new mBank became seriously cool.  As a result, they&rsquo;ve one global awards for innovation everywhere but, when it comes to it, all they did is create a mobile, social bank fit for the internet age.  Every financial firm has to do this but, unlike mBank, most banks don&rsquo;t have the guts to make the change.  That&rsquo;s the thing.  Does the leader of the firm &ndash; the CEO &ndash; have the guts to commit to digital 100%?  If they don&rsquo;t, does the firm have a future?  I doubt it.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-01 15:31:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-01 15:31:55.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_u7CMs0F.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-state-of-digital-fintech-and-the-future-bank/\", \"post_id\": \"5817\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-01 15:31:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-01 15:31:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-state-of-digital-fintech-and-the-future-bank\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5816\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2653\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-01-at-8.44.44-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1078\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441191600,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2590,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Do Our Elderly Parents Fall For Obvious Telemarketing Scams?","link":"why-do-our-elderly-parents-fall-for-obvious-telemarketing-scams","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  The professional crooks are at it again. </strong>  The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office recently charged six defendants with yet another telemarketing fraud scheme targeting the elderly.  The allegations are that the con artists sought out and preyed upon the elderly through their lottery scam.  We see these reports often in the news, to the point that they seem very repetitive.  The characters and the amount of money stolen from elders changes but the methods are the same over and over.  They caught the scammers this time and charged them with theft of a total of $400,000 from various victims.  That&rsquo;s the least of it.  Other scams bring in millions from their vulnerable victims.</p><h3> Why do elders fall for these things?  </h3><p> <br/> Why don&rsquo;t they get that the &ldquo;Nigerian prince&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Jamaican Lottery&rdquo; are clearly bogus and not to be trusted?</p><p> There are various reasons why our elders are such easy prey for these thieves.  One root cause is isolation and loneliness, a fact of life for many seniors who are not closely monitored by loved ones.  A pleasant, slick professional calls on the phone in a friendly and engaging manner and traps the vulnerable elder with kind words, attention and a feeling of connection.  The thieves are trained and smart.  They smell the kill. They know exactly what to say to get the elder to trust them.</p><p> Another very important factor is diminished cognition in the elder. The crooks know that if they have a thousand names purchased from magazine subscribers, U.S. lottery or contest entrants and they know the ages of those on the list, that their chances of finding victims are excellent.  Among the elderly on the lists, some of them will be just impaired enough that they can&rsquo;t see a scam coming.  It&rsquo;s inevitable.  Aging can be accompanied by cognitive impairment.  At least a third of those aged 85 and above have dementia in some form.  Scammers simply buy the lists and start calling.  And there are no restrictions against selling the names and personal information such as ages, phone numbers, addresses, etc.to the highest bidder.  If you had the name and age of every person who subscribed to The Reader&rsquo;s Digest, for example, it would be fertile ground for any scammer.  Research into the impairments of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease, for example, tells us that financial judgment may be the first to erode, and it is not obvious at the beginning, though the impairment is significant.</p><p> Another reason why seniors fall for these ripoff schemes is that they feel financially insecure.  Many have lived through the Great Depression. It left an indelible mark on their thinking, that it all could be lost and that what they have might not be enough tomorrow.  Whether it is true or not, it motivates people to succumb to temptation that they can get a great deal of easy money. Perhaps a bit of greed is a factor too.  Even those who are relatively well off can fall prey to the scammers because of any one of these causes or any combination of them.  Intelligence, education, and even training in the field of finance are no protection when impaired judgment and emotions are in play.  Professional criminals can make a victim out of anyone who is vulnerable for any reason.</p><h3> Can we do anything about the problem?</h3><p> <br/> I think we can.</p><p> One of the very best ways to keep them safe is to persuade your aging loved ones that you want to help protect them and that you can do so by monitoring their financial activity online. If they don&rsquo;t bank online, it doesn&rsquo;t preclude you, the adult child from opening an online record of their account with their permission and checking on what goes out of the account.  If you see a wire transfer to an unknown entity, it&rsquo;s a red flag and time to act immediately to stop fraud that may be going on.  Obviously, you need their ok to do this.  Some parents won&rsquo;t allow it.</p><p> My mother in law, Alice is still quite sharp at age 91.  Someone tried the lottery winner scam with her too. She called the number on the fake letter from the &ldquo;Lottery Authority&rdquo; and asked how she would know if they were legitimate.  The accented voice on the other end of the call said &ldquo;well if you think this is fake, you can hang up.&rdquo; So she did. End of scam.  But most of our aging parents are not so smart and not so discriminating. They trust too much.</p><p> Even though Alice is very with it, she did allow my husband, Mikol, to monitor her accounts online. He checks everything once a month and calls her if he has the slightest doubt about any transaction. He also gets copies of her financial records and has already thwarted an unsuitable investment by an unscrupulous financial advisor. The advisor got fired and then had to pay the money back.</p><p> However we do it, we need to check in on our aging loved ones a lot to stop the professional thieves.  I encourage you to have a conversation about lotteries, contests and phone calls asking for personal information with your aging parents.

{"original_id":2591,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Myths That Cause Women to Compete","link":"five-myths-that-cause-women-to-compete","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;What works for men does not always work for women, because success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. That&rsquo;s what the research shows. As a man gets more successful, everyone is rooting for him. As a woman gets more successful, both men and women like her less.&rdquo;  &mdash;Sheryl Sandberg</p><h3> What are the Myths?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  According to the United States Department of Labor, women make up 47% of the workforce. </strong> So, with those kinds of numbers, why do so many ambitious, motivated women feel like the workplace is a battlefield? Here are five myths that cause women to compete with, rather than support, each other&rsquo;s progress.</p><h3> There&rsquo;s not room for all of us to succeed</h3><p> One of the biggest myths we are afraid of is that there is not enough room for all of us to succeed. If this were true, why wouldn&rsquo;t it apply to men just as much as women? We seem to think that there is ample opportunity for men to succeed, but that the opportunity for women is limited. This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth; there is room and opportunity for all of us to succeed. While we can&rsquo;t all hold the same position in the same organization, there are an abundance of leadership and entrepreneurial opportunities as well as opportunities to make a valuable contribution or meaningful impact if we keep our eyes and minds open.</p><p> To overcome this myth, we must learn that EVERY woman can make a difference. We must work together to overcome the challenges we face in the workplace. We need to change our perception that there are only a few seats at the table for powerful women. It&rsquo;s up to us to bring about positive change. We need each other&rsquo;s support; no one should feel like they have to go it alone.</p><h3> We must compete at a man&rsquo;s game</h3><p> Another myth is that we, as women, must compete at a man&rsquo;s game and on their terms. We now make up 47% of the workforce, why do we feel like we are playing on the competition&rsquo;s home turf? Most people still seem to feel more comfortable when a man is in charge. As women, we face criticism when they act like a boss. The cards are already stacked against women; so, it&rsquo;s up to us to change the game.</p><p> When we compete with one another, we play right into the man&rsquo;s game. To overcome this myth, we should be supporting each other in our quest to fill high-power positions. Women are every bit as capable as men to fill leadership roles; we need to stop undermining each other by harshly judging, spreading rumors, and acting like catty, high school teenagers.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s survival of the fittest</h3><p> It is a myth that, in business, only the fittest survive. This promotes an &lsquo;every woman for herself&rsquo; mentality. It encourages an attitude of exclusion rather than inclusion. The truth is, when we help each other, we all succeed.</p><p> To overcome this myth we must learn to value each other&rsquo;s passion and contributions. We must create an environment of trust where women can feel safe to share ideas and know they will be taken seriously. Instead of hoarding our wisdom and experience for our own benefit, we need to provide mentorship for other women and create great role models for others to follow. We are stronger when we work together.</p><h3> If we bring others down it brings us up</h3><p> One of the most dangerous myths that affects both our personal and professional lives is that if we put others down we will look and feel better about ourselves. This only works in the short-term, over time this behavior actually destroys our own self-esteem and sabotages our chances of success. Putting others down not only negatively affects how you feel about yourself, but also how other people perceive you.</p><p> If we are going to overcome this myth, we have to learn to work together instead of against each other. We all have strengths and weaknesses and something of value to contribute. We need to help bring out the best in each other, rather than tear each other down. Your actions speak to your character and your values; consciously focus your behavior on the message you are sending about yourself.</p><h3> Our emotions are a weakness</h3><p> One of the main myths we believe is that we must compensate for our emotions by showing that we can be tough and ruthless. But, emotional intelligence and empathy have been proven to be leadership strengths, not weaknesses. Great leaders are passionate and that passion often translates into emotion. But, women are more likely than men to be labeled as emotional versus passionate.</p><p> So, how do we overcome this myth? First, stop apologizing for showing your emotions. You allowing yourself to be feminine or emotional is never an excuse for others to treat you as weak, do not permit it. Being courageous enough to be in touch with, and acknowledge, our own emotions allows us to understand and empathize with the emotions of others; this is one of our greatest strengths, not a weakness.</p><h3> Change the Game</h3><p> <br/> As women, we need to take an active role in overcoming these myths and supporting each other. When we compete against one another we are missing a huge opportunity. When we refuse to let these myths govern our behavior we are operating outside of, what have become, cultural norms; this can cause discomfort. Well, get comfortable being uncomfortable.</p><p> We need to capitalize on the collaborative intelligence we have as women. Start building bridges that give all women a hand up. Share opportunities with each other. Be compassionate, inclusive, and generous. We are each responsible for how we choose to behave; choose behaviors that are encouraging and supportive of other women. Let&rsquo;s change the game.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-01 17:33:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-01 17:33:36.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_jub7cgM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-myths-that-cause-women-to-compete/\", \"post_id\": \"5821\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-01 17:33:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-01 17:33:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-myths-that-cause-women-to-compete\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5820\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2656\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-01-at-11.15.26-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"679\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441225500,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

A sip at the Tipsy Seagull might also be in order, along with a quick trip to Abaco Ceramics for their signature white clay pottery. Then carry on to the Green Turtle Cay town of New Plymouth, where two marinas greet you at the north end, along with an exceptionally beautiful scene at Coco Beach with its graceful casuarina pines. Fabulous for fishing, diving, and sunning, Green Turtle Cay is also a fun onshore excursion for casual dining and live local music.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NIPPERS-BAR-AND-GRILL.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 3: </strong> Great Guana Cay is a narrow slip of sand with a superb Atlantic side beach favored by loggerhead and hawksbill turtles. The elkhorn and staghorn coral reef makes a delightful underwater adventure for snorkeling or diving. Although only inhabited by 150 full time residents, the island celebrates the good life, and enjoys a festive reputation. Join in the fun at Nippers Bar and Grill, or up the scale just a bit at their fine dining option, Overso. Sundays host a pig roast, and Fridays feature Conch in the Bag, but every day features a smile and a sip. Dress is casual.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MAN-O-WAR-CAY.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 4 </strong> : Man O War Cay is the flip side of Great Guana, being very conservative, as well as dry with regard to beverage service. A lovely Loyalist settlement, the native population remains steadfastly committed to the British Crown. Peaceful, friendly, and clean, it is a charming, authentic, Caribbean scene.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/HOPE-TOWN-ELBOW-CAY.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 5: </strong> Hope Town on Elbow Cay is another typical New England style town, replete with its candy-striped lighthouse built in 1863. The Tahiti Beach area at the south end of the island is the place to head for swimming. Pelican Cays National Park offers protected aquatic and avian nature viewing at its best. Should you feel like an onshore excursion, dinner and drinks at the Harbour Lodge&rsquo;s Reef Bar and Grill has a decent menu. Consider arranging a private gourmet beach picnic as a divine alternative.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BIGHT-OF-OLD-ROBINSON.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 6: </strong> Little Harbour offers some fabulous bonefishing along the Bight of Old Robinson, and some terribly interesting abandoned pirate caves that invite a curious explore beneath the cliffs. After a casual day on board, or water play with sea turtles and an amazing show of coral on the reef, tender in to Pete&rsquo;s Pub where a continuous event calendar celebrates all manner of fetes, with live music and a Blaster, a house drink favorite guaranteed to bring a smile.</p><p> Day 7: Head back to Marsh Harbour, devouring the view to savor until your next excursion, maybe including a visit to John Bull for a little bling or a new Rolex. Doubtfully your last experience, it is certain you&rsquo;ll want to return again and again.

{"original_id":2593,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Drive Your Best Employees to the Competition","link":"how-to-drive-your-best-employees-to-the-competition","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Today&rsquo;s job market is recession-weary and hyper-competitive, with a flood of potential employees for every open position. To many employers, it might seem that the odds are stacked in their favor. They can afford to be choosy, demand more and offer less. After all, there are plenty of qualified applicants waiting in the wings.</p><p> However, there&rsquo;s a big danger in treating your employees like a commodity. The best employees&mdash;those with high skills and/or knowledge, flexibility, a great work ethic, and passionate&mdash;are hard to come by in a market flooded with desperate applicants. And those types of employees are being actively sought by your competition.</p><p> Great employees are the lifeblood of any organization, yet many feel under-appreciated for their efforts (or even invisible). Are your best and brightest secretly updating their resumes? Here are seven ways you can lose them to your competitors if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p><h3> No one is listening</h3><p> <br/> Every human being needs to feel that their contributions are appreciated and that their opinion matters. Otherwise work is a mindless drudge with no purpose (other than a paycheck), and the employee has no emotional connection to the work they do or the company that employs them. This kind of disconnect results in poor performance, high levels of emotional stress and turnover. When no one seems to be listening and nothing they do seems to make a difference, your employees will seek that fundamental validation somewhere else.</p><h3> Culture only values success</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with setting the bar high, but pitting your employees against each other in terms of performance is a recipe for failure. People want to feel they belong to a workplace community where they can develop friendships, encourage others and feel encouraged themselves. Companies that only seem to value &ldquo;wins&rdquo; and &ldquo;quota crushers&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t encourage a culture of community lose out. Those that value team building and encourage risk taking, on the other hand, tend to keep quality employees longer.</p><h3> No internal mentoring&hellip; from both sides</h3><p> <br/> Speaking of teams, it&rsquo;s really no secret that mentoring (both being mentored and the act of mentoring another person), is a valuable practice for both new and established employees. It instills a sense of welcome for the new employee who&rsquo;s a little nervous about fitting in, and helps all participants establish good relationships in a collaborative atmosphere. Why are so many companies not making this a priority for their HR departments? Nothing is more frustrating than entering a new job and feeling isolated as you&rsquo;re trying to learn the ropes. If you were to walk into a new company and be told, &ldquo;Welcome to Company X! Here&rsquo;s your desk, and here&rsquo;s a copy of the company employee manual&mdash;good luck!&rdquo; How would you feel? Not having an internal mentoring system is plain old poor business practice&hellip; and it should not go away as soon as the new employee feels comfortable, continuous mentoring is how you build leaders for the future and keep employees longer. If you want to retain good people, set up one. Otherwise you&rsquo;re shooting yourself in the foot.</p><h3> People are afraid to voice their opinions</h3><p> <br/> Are your employees afraid that if they voice an opinion they might get put down, harassed or even fired? This is another culture issue that is overlooked by those organizations that are out of touch with their staff. Remember, you&rsquo;re not the only game in town. There are plenty of companies among your competition that  <u>  encourage open communication </u>  as an integral part of their culture. If your employees&rsquo; feel they have to be silent drones and watch their backs in order to keep their positions, you can bet they&rsquo;ll soon be looking around for a more positive environment in which to work. How many of you have been in brain storming sessions, one after another&hellip; with no Brains Storming???</p><h3> Senior leadership is removed and doesn&rsquo;t lead by example</h3><p> <br/> Your employees watch your leadership style and take cues from it. If they never hear a word from the C-suite outside the executive office, or if they feel there is a disparity between your stated values and what you actually do&mdash;watch out. It&rsquo;s hard to &ldquo;rally the troops&rdquo; if they don&rsquo;t feel connected to you or your ideals. Leaders who truly inspire their employees lead by example. They&rsquo;re personable and accessible, and employees feel they can trust them. Do more of that or your likely to lose your employees with the highest integrity&mdash;the ones you really want to keep.</p><h3> Stifling social environment</h3><p> <br/> Do you require that employees shut down (or severely limit) their social presence? Are violations of this policy grounds for dismissal? If you&rsquo;re afraid of what your employees might say about you in their private networks, then you&rsquo;ve either hired the wrong employees or you&rsquo;re in the wrong business. Every company should have a clear social media policy, but it shouldn&rsquo;t include draconian measures to control conversation. More and more companies are finding value in  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/empower-your-employees-and-they-will-power-your-brand-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   empowering their employees to be advocates  </a> </u>  for them in their private networks. Your best employees can also be your top advocates to the outside world&mdash;and garner more trust with your brand than your executives. Trying to quash social connection is short-sighted and ultimately destructive. Employees are going to &ldquo;be social&rdquo; anyway. They will seek a work environment that penalizes them less and appreciates them more.</p><h3> No ability to work remotely occasionally</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m always surprised by the number of companies today that are inflexible when it comes to allowing personnel to work remotely (at least some of the time). It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;control&rdquo; thing, and it&rsquo;s seldom warranted. Do you really have to have every worker under your thumb at the office every day? Current technologies make it relatively easy to set up remote networks, monitor hours, set up group meetings&mdash;everything you can do from the office. Most employees view being able to work remotely (even one day a week) as a great perk, and it can benefit your organization as well. In fact, some large-scale enterprises are finding it cheaper to send a significant number of their personnel home to work rather than having them take up expensive corporate space. Given the right tools and support, any employee who&rsquo;s disciplined and dedicated can manage their time well enough to work from home effectively. Watch your competition&rsquo;s practices. They might be stealing some of your best workers with this perk.</p><p> As you can see, retaining great employees isn&rsquo;t just a matter of paying them more. You need to also pay attention to them more. If the people who run your company&rsquo;s day-to-day operations feel ignored, unappreciated or stifled, they most likely won&rsquo;t stick around long. The best way to keep great employees is to show them you truly  <u>  value their contribution </u> . Avoid the above scenarios.</p><p> Chances are good that your competition is going out of their way to offer support, a flexible working environment and a sense of family and common purpose. If you do the same, chances are good that your relationships with your best employees will flourish.</p><p> This post originally appeared on  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ted Rubin  </a> </u></p> ","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-01 19:00:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-01 19:00:52.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_WNsfVNl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-drive-your-best-employees-to-the-competition/\", \"post_id\": \"5831\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-01 19:00:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-01 19:00:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-drive-your-best-employees-to-the-competition\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5830\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2658\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-01-at-12.10.59-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"338\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441195200,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

Many of the advisory firms we work with hold strategic planning sessions to outline initiatives for the coming year. The meetings often leave advisors and leaders with a little voice whispering, &ldquo;Was the meeting valuable?&rdquo;</p><p> Like all meetings, strategic planning sessions cannot serve as a &ldquo;once-and-done&rdquo; meeting of the minds. Intentions and hopes can&rsquo;t be filed in a desk drawer until the next annual session. Strategic planning doubles as a process and a plan that needs to be monitored and reviewed regularly. The end result will provide identified goals, strategies, and specific action steps for implementation.</p><p> Your strategic plan should serve as a blueprint to grow your business. The tips provided below are the compilation of best practices from financial advisory teams we work with.</p><h3> HOW TO PREPARE FOR YOUR STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSION </h3><p> <br/> Effective meetings have three things in common:</p><li> Agendas are provided and followed</li><li> Objectives are achieved</li><li> Team members feel that time, effort, and sensible processes were followed <br/>  </li><p> Select topics that affect the entire team. Team meeting time is expensive and should be used to collaborate and make decisions on issues that are interdependent, or in other words, that matter to the whole team. Interdependent issues are ones in which individuals must coordinate their actions with the rest of the group. Some examples might include: How can we best share resources? How do we eliminate bottlenecks in the office? If the team isn&rsquo;t actively involved during the meeting discussing interdependent issues, they will become disengaged with the process and feel the meeting was irrelevant to them.</p><h3> PRIOR TO THE MEETING</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s vital to specify how your team should prepare for the meeting. Provide ample time so your team is prepared with their thoughts regarding each item on the agenda.</p><li> Provide an agenda and a clearly-defined three to five year vision of your firm to all attendees. Recommend any information that may be relevant to your planning session such as books, whitepapers, competitive analysis, and/or trends. </li><li> Seek input from team members and ask for suggested agenda items.</li><li> Ask each team member to prepare an overview of department strengths and weaknesses from the prior year along with the top three to five proposed initiatives for the next year. During the meeting, avoid placing too much focus on what didn&rsquo;t get accomplished. Use this as an opportunity to learn and celebrate the &ldquo;wins.&rdquo; </li><li> Complete a market analysis to determine how behaviors are changing within your target market and identify strategies your competitors are using. </li><li> Invite an outside facilitator if necessary. <br/>  </li><p> Your agenda will be based on the amount of time you allow for your strategic session and should include each of the items listed in the sample agenda below.</p><h3> SAMPLE STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSION AGENDA &ndash; DAY 1 <br/>  </h3><a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Strategic-Planning-Session-Sample-Agenda-Day-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Strategic Planning Session Sample Agenda Day 1\" src=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Strategic-Planning-Session-Sample-Agenda-Day-1.jpg\"/></a><h3>  </h3><h3> SAMPLE STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSION AGENDA &ndash; DAY 2 <br/>  </h3><a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Strategic-Planning-Session-Sample-Agenda-Day-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Strategic Planning Session Sample Agenda Day 2\" src=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Strategic-Planning-Session-Sample-Agenda-Day-21.jpg\"/></a><h3> <br/> IN CONCLUSION</h3><p> <br/> End the meeting on a high note. Invest a few minutes to discuss what was done well and what needs to be done differently for the next meeting. This enables your team to improve performance, productivity, and relationships.

From developing a digital strategy, choosing and leveraging different digital channels, to measuring and tracking success, there are many examples of companies successfully disseminating a consistent message across on and offline channels. Indeed, as  <a href=\"http://www.infinitive.com/2014/08/14/omni-channel-integration-the-new-digital-marketing-imperative/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   this  </u>    </a> much-shared article notes, &ldquo;omni-channel integration is now the holy grail capability in the digital world&rdquo;.</p><p> What is less well understood is the &ldquo;how to&rdquo; of integrating this brave new digital world into traditional marketing strategies. While it is more and more apparent that integration is key to success, many companies continue to manage their digital and traditional marketing efforts separately.</p><p> This flies in the face of the reality that a unified and seamless management of customer and brand assets across digital and traditional channels improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of a marketing plan.</p><p> Digital strategies should not take the place of a traditional marketing plan, but they can, and should, amplify marketing and communication initiatives, by engaging with customers on the channels they already use, providing a greater number of customer touch points and ultimately changing the way customers and prospects engage.</p><p> In other words, they allow marketers to unify their marketing goals with the best digital technologies.</p><p> To give you access to the best current thinking, we have compiled the following articles and general tips from leading marketers and digital strategists:</p><h3> 1. Make branding consistent across all channels </h3><p> According to Christine Moorman, in her article  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/christinemoorman/2014/12/16/12-tips-for-integrating-social-media-into-your-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">   12 Tips for Integrating Social Media Strategy into your Marketing Strategy  </a> </u> , consistent branding should be extended to social media channels, for example, creating templates and guidelines for Facebook and Twitter posts in order to achieve strategic alignment.</p><h3> 2. Choose strategy over tools</h3><p> Ask yourself whether a new social media tool will really help design or develop a more effective marketing strategy. A bright and shiny object, chosen simply because it&rsquo;s new is not the answer.</p><h3> 3. Interaction between online and offline activities is vital</h3><p> The article  <u>  3 Ways to Integrate Digital and Traditional Marketing </u> , highlights the need to use traditional marketing to promote digital activities. For example, traditional advertising can be used to drive traffic to your website. In the same way, information gleaned from online campaigns can be used to develop more focused offline campaigns.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/66290-8-Ways-to-Integrate-Social-Media-with-Existing-Marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 Ways to Integrate Social Media with Existing Marketing  </a> </u> , by Paul Chaney, argues that using social media to promote more traditional marketing campaigns can also be very effective. For example, the 2012 Nike #makeitcount campaign where the public was asked to share how they planned to #makeitcount that year, was so successful that it was continued into 2013.</p><h3> 4. Integrate your teams</h3><p> By allowing social media experts to live and work within brand and customer teams, social media strategies can be employed as soon as communication objectives are set. And decisions on each side of the coin can be informed by the thinking and expertise of the other.</p><h3>  5. Control the social media megaphone</h3><p> Protect your online reputation by controlling your social media efforts. For companies with different brands, for example, allowing every brand to have its own Facebook page or Twitter account might not be the best strategy. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/christinemoorman/2014/12/16/12-tips-for-integrating-social-media-into-your-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">   Christine Moorman  </a> </u>  points out, deciding which social media platform is ideal for a given brand from a strategic point of view is key.</p><p> The bottom line? While few CMOs would question the need for a digital marketing strategy, many may still be struggling to accept digital strategies as part of the traditional marketing toolkit, rather than a separate and unconnected marketing tool. However, a genuinely successful marketing strategy must embrace the best that both worlds have to offer, and more importantly, ensure they work together as a seamless and integrated whole.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-01 21:03:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-01 21:03:48.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Aclh6bW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-medium-is-the-message-or-is-it/\", \"post_id\": \"5835\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-01 21:03:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-01 21:03:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-medium-is-the-message-or-is-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5834\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2660\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/obey-giant-01-expo.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"392\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441206000,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

Because it is a great way to organising our Territory; segmenting our pipeline and activities (Both Selling and Demand Generation).</p><h3> What does ToFu, MoFu, BoFu mean?</h3><p> <br/> Before I lose you, the meanings are as follows: ToFu (Top of the Funnel), MoFu (Middle of the Funnel) and BoFu (Bottom of the Funnel). The rest of the blog explains as Modern Sales People we need to think about these terms as we segment and plan our weeks.</p><h3> The Sales Person&rsquo;s Average Week &ndash; I&rsquo;m far too Busy Running Around to Plan</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t know about you but I try and plan my week around the different activities we sales people need to action. Focusing in on the deals I need to close, working on the actions that will move my deals through the pipeline. For example, sorting demonstrations, working on business cases, get experts and senior managers briefed and lined up.</p><p> All transactional, which if we are not careful, we allow our time to expand, because as sales people we all love that sort of stuff. I&rsquo;m sure that as a reader of this blog you are not like a sales people who I worked with who said to me &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far too busy running around, to sit down and plan.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m guessing that as you have read this far, you are not.</p><h3> This all Feels like Revision to me!</h3><p> <br/> When we were at college or school, there was stuff that we know we should do, but we always avoid it, as we don&rsquo;t like it. Great example of that was revision. But revision helped us get through exams. Those exams, helped us progress. Like revision, there are three things we avoid because we don&rsquo;t like doing them. They are: &ndash;</p><li> Demand Generation</li><li> Turning the &ldquo;deals&rdquo; we have sold into References and Advocates</li><li> Personal Branding <br/>  </li><p> Let&rsquo;s take each of these and why we must find time during the week to do these activities or we are failing as professional sales people.</p><p> <strong>  Demand Generation </strong>  &ndash; As professional Sales Person are you really going to outsource your success, how much you earn and your professionalism to the Telesales Team or the Marketing department? No, you need to take control, in future blogs I will give you an automated, optimal way of doing this.</p><p> <strong>  Building References </strong>  &ndash; In the last 30 years us Enterprise Sales people, have educated prospects that they must have a reference visit. While in most cases, this will just validate the decision. My colleagues always complain there are no references, or it seems I have all the references accounts. Why? Because I know I need references to sell, therefore I cultivate them. The sharp readers will have already spotted that Social Sellers should help prospects, my mindset to build long-term relationships with customers&rsquo; starts during the sale. Differentiates me against you and why I win.</p><p> <strong>  Personal Branding </strong>  &ndash; Any of the subscribers and long-term readers know my view on personal branding. Travel time is a great way to invest in building that personal brand. On a train or in a taxi, work on that brand.</p><h3> So what has this got to do with the Marketing terms ToFu, MoFu and BoFu?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  ToFu &ndash; Top of the Funnel </strong>  &ndash; To create new business, we must find people who haven&rsquo;t even thought about buying what we have to sell. Creating desire and curiosity with these people to the point where they think &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a look&rdquo;. Most prospects will at this point, do their own research. Think about the job titles of people you are trying to sell to, you need to create content that appeals to them. A Finance Director is very different from a Financial Controller, don&rsquo;t try and cut corners by having a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; strategy. Also, let&rsquo;s be honest here, yes we all say we sell at C-Level, but do we really?</p><p> <strong>  MoFU &ndash; Middle of the Funnel </strong>  &ndash; Anybody prospect doing their own research will be in &ldquo;Sales Person avoidance&rdquo; mode. Which is why I use my Personal Brand and Thought Leadership position, so these people find me. Either I will try and close these before you find them Or I will place them in nurture. You can use a Marketing Automation tool to do this, or take it on yourself. Again I have a programmatic process to do this, which I will share at a later date.</p><p> Tip: Want a way to create some content that will &ldquo;hook&rdquo; your prospects and move them to the next stage? &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an objection that you get in the sales process, and what&rsquo;s your response?&rdquo; Why do you want to know that? Here&rsquo;s why: The objection &mdash; with a bit of editing &mdash; will make a fabulous blog headline. The answer &mdash; with your deft hands at the keyboard &mdash; will make a great blog post. When the prospect sees that post, they will look so smart and they will give you lots of credit as a thought leader. Try it just once, and you&rsquo;ll be hooked.</p><p> <strong>  BoFu &ndash; The Bottom of the Funnel  </strong> &ndash; is where you are close in on that meeting. Don&rsquo;t forget in this new world of SaaS, the meeting will be with Need and Authority ( <u>  BANT, Budget, Authority, Need and Timing </u> ) as it will be your job as you move them through the funnel to build the Budget and Timing.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-01 21:10:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-01 21:10:32.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_pvPnbww.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/work-your-social-selling-funnel-with-tofu-mofu-and-bofu/\", \"post_id\": \"5837\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-01 21:10:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-01 21:10:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"work-your-social-selling-funnel-with-tofu-mofu-and-bofu\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5836\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2661\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tofu-catagory.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"831\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441221300,"author_id":482,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2598,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Build Confidence, Follow Your Dreams","link":"build-confidence-follow-your-dreams","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-fitness/201501/6-reasons-we-don-t-chase-our-dreams\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   6 Reasons We Don't Chase Our Dreams  </a> </u> , Barton Goldsmith (psychologytoday.com) offers six things that hold us back from pursuing what we want: </p><li> We're too shy to ask</li><li> We don't feel like we deserve it</li><li> We question our ability</li><li> We don't have the time to take on anything more</li><li> We tell our self that there's someone better than us</li><li> We're trying to keep a low profile</li><p> <br/> Pursuing big dreams is scary. It's easy to fall prey to \"not enough\" syndrome and start comparing ourselves to others. I've been pursuing my dream of business ownership for two years. It took me the better part of the first one and a half years to work my way out of the beliefs I had about my ability to measure up as a new business owner. Even though I was excited about my new adventure, it was also terrifying.  It took awhile to build up my confidence.  <br/> <br/> In The Confidence Code, Katty Kay &amp; Claire Shipman wrote that confidence is a complex yet essential life ingredient. Women in particular have suffered from a lack of self-belief; we may have the skills necessary to pursue a dream or accomplish a goal, but we often don't believe that we can succeed, so we don't even try. We may have big dreams or set lofty goals, but our desires don't turn into action. Or in my case, I was taking action, but was playing it safe and holding myself back due in large part to my lack of confidence.  <br/> <br/> What gets in our way of taking action?  Kay and Shipman wrote that over-thinking, people pleasing, and an inability to let go of defeats are three ways that we undermine our confidence. I shudder now when I think about how many hours I have wasted either writing a blog post (and rewriting and revising: one time I spent over two and a half hours reworking one blog post!), or worrying about what people would think about a post I had published (or wishing I hadn't written a particular post). <br/> <br/> Related to these obstacles is a desire for perfection. Constantly striving for perfection is not only time consuming, but it can also stop us dead in our tracks.  Kay and Shipman wrote that of all things \"women do to themselves to undermine their confidence... the pursuit of perfection [is] the most crippling. If perfection is your standard...the bar is always impossibly high, and you will inevitably and routinely feel inadequate.\"   <br/> <br/> According to Kay and Shipman, women in particular are susceptible to perfectionism, obsessing about our performance at home, at work, and even on vacation. The impacts of perfectionism impact us not only as employees, but as mothers, as wives, as sisters and as friends.  <br/> <br/> I am a perfection-seeking working mother. (You can read more about my experience with this in a recent  <u>  LinkedIn post </u> ). I have struggled to blend my role as a mother with my desire for perfection and control.  ( <u>  Did you read another recent post about how I was put to the test by a mis-matched outfit? </u> ) <br/> <br/> I am learning that it is not realistic to expect everything to be perfect. Women, especially mothers: We need to let go of this desire to be perfect all the time. The fact is, we are all human beings and we are going to make mistakes. And yes, we are going to fail. And I've found that as I have started to let go of my desire to be perfect, it's so much easier to enjoy what I'm doing and who I am with in this moment. When I'm not trying to control what my husband does or how my daughter acts, I find it much less stressful for everyone and we are happier.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Building Confidence </strong> <br/> Kay and Shipman made several suggestions for strengthening your confidence.  Confidence comes from believing that we can succeed at something and from taking action. Confidence comes by not letting your doubts consume you and by letting go of your comfort zone to do hard things.  The authors add that it's easier to keep going if you are optimistic and hopeful about the outcome, if you have self-esteem (belief in your worth), and if you have self-efficacy (belief in your ability to succeed at something). You build your confidence when you take risks and try new things. And by the way, you need to be comfortable with failure. We learn from our failures. The more we fail, the more we learn and the more comfortable we become with taking bigger risks later. Being compassionate with ourselves when things don't go as expected goes a long way, too.  <br/> <br/> I've taken a lot of action over this past year to strengthen my confidence. Some small steps, and some big steps. Almost all were scary. But each time I did something new, each time I put myself out there, it got easier.  Now I've taken a really big step by entering in the Dream Big, Grow Here contest. This grant is available for Iowans to fulfill their dreams for self-employment or business expansion.  I'm competing for the chance to win an industry-specific grant which would help me fund some specialized training I am pursuing this year.   <u>  You can read more about why I entered the contest in a recent LinkedIn blog post </u> , or read the details about my entry on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dreambiggrowhere.com/Vote.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dream Big, Grow Here  </a> </u>  site.

Children will be soon be lamenting the end of summer and parents are anxiously awaiting the big yellow bus so they can get their lives back on a regular schedule.</p><p> If it seems as though retailers have been advertising for back-to-school since the day school let out back in June, you are right. That&rsquo;s because back-to-school typically represents the second largest retail sales season, with 2015 sales  <u>  <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/after-splurging-2014-families-trim-back-school-spending-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   predicted to top out at $68 billion  </a> </u>  inclusive of grades K through college. While $68 billion is quite an impressive number, it does represent a 9% decrease from last year. With the National Retail Federation (NRF) convinced that many retailers will be called to the principal&rsquo;s office in September for poor performance, retailers have significantly turned up the dial on advertising, in addition to offering steep discounts and staying open extended hours in order to prove them wrong.</p><p> Further complicating the issue is that retailers are finding it challenging to measure actual sales performance, with the lines blurring as to what constitutes back-to-school from both actual purchasing behavior and the varied types of retailers who are vying for our attention. Regarding purchasing behavior, back-to-school typically represents a finite period of time&mdash;the four weeks prior to school starting. Now, consumers are shopping back-to-school all year round as they purchase laptops, tablets, smartphones and the various necessities used for everyday conveniences when needed. They are also replenishing supplies throughout the year, avoiding the need for major restocking before school starts.</p><p> Why the shift in behavior? Electronics and technology have impacted our lives as both we and our children rely on multiple devices to keep us connected everyday&mdash;not just during the school year. Additionally, the ease, convenience, heavy discounts and free shipping offered year-long from unconventional back-to-school retailers such as Amazon.com and an increased emphasis on e-commerce from Target and Walmart make shopping only a click away.</p><p> Given this shift in purchase behavior and in the types of retailers who are competing for our dollars during this critical back-to-school sales season, I thought that it would be interesting to take a closer look to see which retailers are actually making the grade. Based on my own personal experience just this week shopping for two college-age children, I was expecting that Target, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Walmart, Staples and Costco to be the top performers. After all, I have the receipts to prove it.</p><p> Tenet Partners recently released its  <u>  <a href=\"http://tenetpartners.com/about-us/news/2015-08-11-top-20-most-powerful-Back-to-School.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top 20 Most Powerful Back-to-School Retail Brands Report  </a> </u> , which is based on the performance of those retail brands tracked in its  <u>  <a href=\"http://tenetpartners.com/assets/pdfs/tenetPartners-CBI-V4-16Jul2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CoreBrand&reg; Index (CBI)  </a> </u> . While I was scanning the list of the Top 20, it was quite apparent that the back-to-school retail landscape is comprised of retailers in all shapes and sizes with apparel, shoe, book, office supply, big box, mass merchandiser, club, eyewear and e-commerce brands all competing for our share of wallet (or backpack). Most of the retailers I expected, with the exception of Costco, made the list with some passing flying colors while others struggled to make the grade. Barnes &amp; Noble, Target, Walmart and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond have the strongest  <u>  <a href=\"http://tenetpartners.com/corebrand-analytics/brand-power.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BrandPower  </a> </u>  grade scoring above 60. Amazon.com, with a BrandPower score of 59, is demonstrating the strongest brand momentum and could soon become head of the class. Many of the traditional back-to-school brands such Staples, Office Depot and Office Max, while making the Top 20, are struggling to make the grade.</p><p> I was quite surprised to see Barnes &amp; Noble occupy the #1 spot. While on the surface it certainly makes sense for a bookstore to be on this list, one would think that the many challenges plaguing this retailer would have a negative impact on its performance. That is until I read more about what is contributing to its success&mdash;innovation. Barnes &amp; Noble is being quite smart about its future business model, which includes the spinning off of its college bookstore business into Barnes and Noble Education; fueling its ability to expand its presence across many college campuses as well as its digital presence via new technology platforms and apps geared toward Millennials. I was equally surprised to see LensCrafters make the Top 10. Here again we see innovation as a key ingredient behind its powerful performance. LensCrafters is placing an increased emphasis on the in-store customer experience by using advances in technology to uniquely engage customers.</p><p> It seems that the key ingredient to being a powerful back-to-school brand includes the use of innovation to establish strong connections with customers. It also includes using technology to enhance the customer experience through digital and mobile applications as well as having a strong e-commerce platform that connects customers (24/7). Providing a wide product selection, offering customer customization, frequent discounts and convenient shipping (not only free shipping, but direct shipping to college dorms) also proved to be key strategies for getting high marks.</p><p> Are you surprised by any of the retailers on Tenet&rsquo;s Top 20 Most Powerful Back-to-School Retail Brands list? What brands are missing?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-01 21:30:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-01 21:30:44.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_N67qZAb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/back-to-school-2015/\", \"post_id\": \"5843\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-01 21:30:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-01 21:30:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"back-to-school-2015\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5842\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2664\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Soleil-Moon-Frye-Goes-Back-School-Shopping-sZOi4lHHhkUl.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1000\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441216800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2600,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"China's Economy Is Undergoing a Huge Transformation That No One's Talking About","link":"chinas-economy-is-undergoing-a-huge-transformation-that-no-ones-talking-about","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The photo you see above was snapped recently in Beijing. It might not be that special to some readers, but in my 25 years of visiting the Chinese capital, I&rsquo;ve never seen a blue sky because it&rsquo;s always been blotted out by yellow smog. Beijing is clearly undergoing a massive transformation right now. This might please proponents of the green movement, but it&rsquo;s ultimately harmful to the health of China's manufacturing sector.</p><p> On the other hand, blue skies could be ahead for China&rsquo;s service industries.</p><p> Misconception and exaggeration are circling China&rsquo;s economy right now like a flock of hungry buzzards. If you listen only to the popular media, you might believe that the Asian giant is teetering on the brink of economic disaster, with the Shanghai Composite Index&rsquo;s recent correction and devaluation of the renminbi held up as &ldquo;proof.&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. These events are indeed significant and have real consequences. They also make for some great, sensational headlines, as I discussed  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/china-not-immune-to-contagious-quantitative-easing-and-massive-printing-of-cheap-money/#.Vd-Fa5c0O3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   earlier this month  </u>  . </a></p><p> But what gets hardly any coverage is that China&rsquo;s economy is not weakening so much as it&rsquo;s changing, much like Beijing&rsquo;s skies. Take a look at the following two charts, courtesy of BCA Research:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Chinas-economy-is-shifting-away-from-manufacturing-more-toward-services-08282015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China's Economy is Shifting Away from Manufacturing More Towards Services\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Chinas-economy-is-shifting-away-from-manufacturing-more-toward-services-08282015.png\"/> </a> <br/> You can see that the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy has begun to shift away from manufacturing and more toward consumption and the service industries. While the country&rsquo;s purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) reading has been in contraction mode since March of this year, the service industries&mdash;which include financial services, insurance, entertainment, tourism and more&mdash;are ever-expanding. The problem is that the transformation has not been fast enough to offset the massive size of the manufacturing sector.</p><p> Just as a refresher, the PMI is forward-looking and resets every 30 days. It helps investors manage expectations. Consider this: The best-performing country in our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/emerging-europe-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Emerging Europe Fund (EUROX)  </a> </u>  is the Czech Republic&mdash;which also happens to have one of the highest PMI readings. Coincidence?</p><p> In China, overseas travel, cinema box office revenue and ecommerce are all seeing &ldquo;explosive growth,&rdquo; according to BCA. The country&rsquo;s once-struggling real estate market is also robust. The government just relaxed rules to permit more foreigners to purchase mainland property.</p><p> But you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to come across any of this constructive news because it&rsquo;s not particularly good for ratings.</p><p> A recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21662581-stockmarket-turmoil-china-need-not-spell-economic-doom-it-does-raise-questions-far\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Economist  </a> </u>  article makes this point very clear: <br/> <br/> The property market matters far more for China&rsquo;s economy than equities do. Housing and land account for the vast majority of collateral in the financial system and play a much bigger role in spurring on growth. Yet the barrage of bearish headlines about share prices has obscured news of a property rebound. House prices have perked up nationwide for three straight months. Two months after the stock market first crashed, this upturn continues.</p><h3> &ldquo;Commodity Imports Have Actually Been Quite Strong&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Again, China&rsquo;s transformation from a manufacturing-based economy to one that focuses on consumption has real consequences, one of the most significant being the softening of global commodity prices. As I told Daniela Cambone on last week&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/in-the-news/frank-holmes-gold-is-not-always-linear/#.VeCWeJc0O3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Gold Game Film  </u>  , </a>  gold&rsquo;s Love Trade has become not a No Trade, but a Slow Trade. We&rsquo;ve seen demand cool along with a decline in GDP per capita, the PMI readings and China&rsquo;s M2 money supply growth.</p><p> Below you can see the relationship between China&rsquo;s M2 money supply growth and metal prices. Since its peak in late 2009, money supply growth has been dropping year-over-year, driving down metal prices.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Chinas-falling-money-supply-since-2009-peak-has-driven-down-metals-prices-08282015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China's falling money supply since 2009 peak has driven down metal prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Chinas-falling-money-supply-since-2009-peak-has-driven-down-metals-prices-08282015.png\"/> </a> <br/> Money supply growth tends to be a &ldquo;first mover.&rdquo; When it has contracted, the PMI has usually followed. Recently, this has hurt economies that depend on China as a net buyer of raw materials, including Brazil, which supplies the Asian country with iron ore, soybeans and many other commodities, and Australia.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Australian-dollar-and-brazilian-real-retreat-with-drop-in-chinas-money-supply-08282015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real Retreat with Drop in China's Money Supply\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Australian-dollar-and-brazilian-real-retreat-with-drop-in-chinas-money-supply-08282015.png\"/> </a> <br/> When M2 money supply growth and the PMIs are rising, commodity prices can also rise. But that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that when new orders for finished products fall, there&rsquo;s less consumption of energy to manufacture and ship. Again, this might make the greenies happy, but it&rsquo;s ultimately bad for manufacturing.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve said several times before that China is the 800-pound commodities gorilla, and it continues to be so. The country currently consumes about a quarter of the total global output of gold. For nickel, copper, zinc, tin and steel, it&rsquo;s around half of world consumption. For aluminum, it&rsquo;s more than half.</p><p> These are huge figures. But investors should know that Chinese imports of these important metals and materials still remain strong. Tom Pugh, a commodities economist at Capital Economics, told the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-remains-a-key-commodities-player-despite-waning-appetites-1440534872\" target=\"_blank\">   Wall Street Journal  </a> </u>  last week that the market has it wrong about China, that the drop in demand has been overstated:</p><p> If you look at Chinese commodity imports over the last few months, they&rsquo;ve actually been quite strong. A lot of it is just that people thought China would continue to grow at 10 percent a year, ad infinitum, and now people are just realizing that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/25/column-russell-china-commodities-idUSL4N1101ZD20150825\" target=\"_blank\">   Reuters  </a> </u>  took a similar stance, reporting that &ldquo;there were at least 21 commodities that showed increases in imports greater than 20 percent in July this year, compared to the same month in 2014.&rdquo; Weakening demand has been caused by a number of reasons, including &ldquo;structural oversupply&rdquo; and &ldquo;the impact of the recent volatility in equity markets.&rdquo;</p><p> But it&rsquo;s important to keep things in perspective. Compared to past major market crashes, China&rsquo;s recent correction doesn&rsquo;t appear that bad.</p><p> <img alt=\"China's Crash is Big, But Not the Biggest\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-chinas-crash-is-big-but-not-the-biggest-08282015.jpg\"/></p><p> Any bad news in this case can be seen as good news. I think that in the next three months we might see further monetary stimulus, following the currency debasement nearly three weeks ago. We might also see the implementation of new reforms in order to address the colossal infrastructure programs China has announced in the last couple of years, the most monumental being the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/what-america-can-learn-from-chinae28099s-infrastructure/#.VeCWJZc0O3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;One Road, One Belt&rdquo;  </a>    </u> initiative.</p><h3> Dividend-Paying Stocks Helped Stanch the Losses</h3><p> <br/> As investors and money managers, it&rsquo;s crucial that we be cognizant of the changes China is undergoing. With volatility high in the Chinese markets right now, we&rsquo;ve raised the cash level in our  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/china-region-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   China Region Fund (USCOX)  </u>  , </a>  and after the dust settles somewhat and the right opportunities arise, we&rsquo;ll be prepared to deploy the cash. We&rsquo;re also diversified outside of China.</p><p> We managed to slow the losses during the Shanghai correction by being invested in high-quality, dividend-paying stocks.</p><p> According to daily data collected since December 2004, the median trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the Shanghai Composite Index constituents currently sits at 48.6 times earnings. If it reverts to the mean, risk is 32 percent to the downside for the index. Currently, the P/E ratio of our China Region Fund constituents sits around 16 times. This suggests that USCOX has less downside risk and is cheaper than the Shanghai Composite.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Median-Trailing-Price-to-Earnings-Ratio-For-Shanghai-Composite-Index-Constituents-08282015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Median Trailing Price-to-Earnings Ratio for Shanghai Composite Index Constituents\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-08-28/COMM-Median-Trailing-Price-to-Earnings-Ratio-For-Shanghai-Composite-Index-Constituents-08282015.png\"/> </a> <br/> We seek to take advantage of the trend toward consumption by increasing our exposure to the growing service industries&mdash;technology, Internet and ecommerce companies (Tencent is one of our top 10 holdings); financial services (AIA and Ping An Insurance); and enviornmental services (wastewater treatment services provider CT Environmental). Rising sports participation among white collar workers in China is very visibile these days. Xian Liang, portfolio manager of USCOX, says that his friends back in Shanghai share with him, via WeChat, how they track their daily runs using mapping apps on their phones.</p><p> With that said, an attractive company is Anta Sports, an emerging, innovative sportswear franchise. Fans of the Golden State Warriors might recall that guard Klay Thompson endorsed its products earlier this year.</p><p> We believe the China region remains one of the most compelling growth stories in the world and continues to provide exciting investment opportunities. </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-01 21:38:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-01 21:38:31.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_NjbTh9F.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/chinas-economy-is-undergoing-a-huge-transformation-that-no-ones-talking-about/\", \"post_id\": \"5845\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-01 21:38:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-01 21:38:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"chinas-economy-is-undergoing-a-huge-transformation-that-no-ones-talking-about\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5844\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2665\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-01-at-2.39.57-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"799\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441197000,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2601,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are Productivity Killers Swamping Your Sales Team? Fight Back!","link":"are-productivity-killers-swamping-your-sales-team-fight-back","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanburkeh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sean Burke  </u> </a> | <u>  kitedesk </u></p><p> On any given day, salespeople can be found juggling a myriad of different tasks, from attending product meetings to customer support requests to keeping prospect records up-to-date. Maintaining discipline and focus in order to block out these distractions is something few reps have effectively mastered.</p><p> As a sales manager, it is your responsibility to help your team balance completing their admin work while still maximizing their time spent selling. Here are six of the most common productivity killers and some tips on how you can help your team fight off lost productivity due to time-draining activities:</p><li> Internal Meetings  &ndash; most successful salespeople guard their time like it was Fort Knox. Every minute of the day not spent on selling is a minute that drives them further from their goals. As a sales leader, you need to be able to communicate with your team, but it can&rsquo;t come at the expense of your salespeople&rsquo;s selling time. <br/>  </li><p> Fight Back!  Choose the meetings sales are required to attend wisely and let them skip meetings that aren&rsquo;t crucial. This allows the team to focus the bulk their time on closing deals instead of sitting in nonessential meetings.</p><li> Research  &ndash; In the modern world of sales, it is important to deliver value and insight as part of your sales process. Sales reps understand they need to differentiate themselves from their competitors by becoming a knowledge source for their clients. However, stats are now starting to show that too much research is actually driving down the percentage of reps hitting quota. <br/>  </li><p> Fight Back! Give your sales team an advantage by providing them tools that automate the research process.</p><li> Selecting and reaching buyers  &ndash; with the tremendous amount of data available to buyers, reaching them has become increasingly difficult. For many buyers, they believe that when they are ready to buy, they will reach out to you. Additionally, reps are now tapping their existing network of relationships for introductions to buyers through existing connections. They are asking for LinkedIn introductions; they are connecting with buyers via Twitter and they are being more selective in the types of companies they target. <br/>  </li><p> Fight Back!  Through the use of customer analytics software, your sales team can streamline the process and target their efforts towards prospects who are more likely to buy.</p><li> Technology  &ndash; A new technology stack for salespeople has emerged. Tools that track email reads, opens, forwards, and responses are helping sales teams A/B test value propositions so they get smarter about their prospecting and their nurturing messages. Gamification is being used to help motivate sales reps activity and results. However, this new stack of technology is now causing a new set of problems. Sales reps are spending too much time working in point solutions that solve one piece of the sales puzzle. <br/>  </li><p> Fight Back!  Reserve these tools for broader use cases so your reps are not overburdened with software requirements.</p><li> Support  &ndash; Once the sale has been completed, customers still need assistance. The first place they traditionally look for this support is to their sales rep. Reps become the first point of contact for support related issues and struggle with the handoff to support. <br/>  </li><p> Fight Back!  Build the handoff to support into your sales process, and include the client in the progression from sales to support. After a deal closes, have the rep introduce the new client to someone in support, and provide the client with that person&rsquo;s name and direct contact information.</p><li> Lack of predictable sales process  &ndash; Sales processes are extremely difficult to create and enforce. Gauging their efficacy takes time and discipline. The larger the complexity of the sale, the harder it is to create a repeatable and predictable sales process. Only the truly committed team makes the investment in measuring each step in the process and tracks all the activity it takes to complete a sale. In order for your sales process to evolve to a repeatable, predictable series of steps and activities, sales leaders must stay the course for a significant time &ndash; which is extremely difficult given their requirement to close business NOW. <br/>  </li><p> Fight Back!  Be patient. It is worth the effort.</p><p> Salespeople like to spend their time selling &ndash; it&rsquo;s what you hired them to do.

Wise marketers want as much money as they can possibly muster to make their advertising dreams a reality. Understood! So the question becomes: &ldquo;How does a marketer justify marketing spend to the CEO?&rdquo; The answer lies in marketing automation.Seasoned marketers know that our industry is 50% creative and 50% math. On one hand, marketing is about branding through images, storytelling and emotion-evoking design work. That&rsquo;s the fun part! On the other hand, marketing is about data, statistics and sales dollars.Many a multi-million-dollar budget is spent using website impressions as a measure of effectiveness. If sales remain steady or slightly increase and people are visiting the site, reading the blog and clicking over to the company&rsquo;s social media pages, then the marketing team is operating &ldquo;efficiently enough&rdquo; to justify the expense.Going one step further, companies trouble themselves with another measurement known as &ldquo;engagement.&rdquo; This metric looks at not just how many eyes are landing on a brand&rsquo;s message, but how many people are liking, linking and sharing, as well as how much time is spent on a site or how many people end up with products in their shopping carts.In 2015, we can do better&hellip; a WHOLE LOT better. Last year, the marketing automation industry grew by 50% to $1.2 billion.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.act-on.com/blog/ceos-say-yes-marketing-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   It&rsquo;s forecasted  </a> </u>  the industry will reach $1.8 billion by the end of the year. There are four reasons why marketing automation becomes the answer to justifying marketing expenditures &mdash; and why companies can&rsquo;t afford to put off this investment any longer. <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automation.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"business marketing automation\" src=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automation.jpg\"/> </a> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://infographicaday.com/building-a-business-case-for-marketing-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   InfographicADay.com  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://infographicaday.com/building-a-business-case-for-marketing-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a></p><h3> 1. Marketing Automation Makes The Meeting.</h3>Boardroom meetings are greatly enriched by the presentation of graphs, charts, statistics and insights based on the numbers. <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-use-marketing-automation-generate-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Marketing automation </a></u> is often painted as a way to store leads and send out emails, but it&rsquo;s so much more than that. Marketing automation captures actionable data like:&ndash; Email opens, bounces and clicks&ndash; Where visitors went on the site, how they got there and where they went next&ndash; Which mediums (be it ad, email, blog) and messages led to increases in buyer interest&ndash; Which mediums and messages did not&ndash; What actions are made within the emails (link clicks, number of opens)&ndash; When prospects are taking steps toward a purchaseUltimately, you want to answer the questions: &ldquo;Which assets provide the most returns and deserve our focus? Which areas could we improve upon or eliminate?&rdquo; Presenting the reports generated from marketing automation programs steers the conversation to help sales and marketing teams direct their efforts.<h3> 2. Marketing Automation Helps Departments Create &amp; Achieve Unified Goals.</h3>A major challenge for sizable organizations lies in aligning sales and marketing goals. Often, the two departments work as separate entities with a liaison or two running communication between the groups. <u> <a href=\"https://www.act-on.com/blog/ceos-say-yes-marketing-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  In one survey </a></u>, 90% of marketers said that lack of sales alignment caused problems in reaching goals. Furthermore, it was discovered that B2B organizations with tightly aligned sales and marketing goals achieved 27% increased profit growth in a three-year period than their peers who struggled to get on the same page. Marketing automation provides a common point of reference for decision making across departments. It&rsquo;s easy to disagree with one person&rsquo;s opinion, but harder to refute measurable evidence.<a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/departments.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"sales and marketing \" src=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/departments.jpg\"/></a>Image Source: <u> EmpireForSales.com</u><h3> 3. Marketing Automation Saves Time &amp; Keeps A Pulse On The Consumer.</h3>CMOs are struggling with increased demands on their time and resources. Seventy-four percent of marketers say that &ldquo;saving time&rdquo; is the biggest benefit of their automation platform. Conservatively, <u> <a href=\"http://www.marketo.com/marketing-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Marketo estimates </a></u> that a marketing team&rsquo;s productivity increases from 1.5 to 6.9% with the use of a marketing automation platform. Why spend more time on personalizing emails, entering buyer data into the database, or monitoring social media conversations than you need to?<u> <a href=\"http://www.aberdeen.com/research/9575/RR-marketing-automation-platform.aspx/content.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Aberdeen Group </a></u> says that best-in-class companies reduce close cycle time by 49% on average with marketing automation. Automating certain processes not only saves time by cutting out tasks that computers can do as well as human beings and freeing up more time for marketers, but it also alerts marketers to critical moments where real-time intervention has the power to convert a sale.<u> <a href=\"http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2358015/why-marketing-automation-is-driving-a-bigger-role-for-the-cmo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Clickz summarizes </a></u>, &ldquo;The tools that are now available to the marketing organization allow them to get super close to the consumer, and keep their thumbs on the pulse of the market. They can measure the smallest of changes in sentiment, and assess when consumer behavior indicates a need for new products or features. The earlier these signals are detected, the quicker the product roadmap can be updated to meet customer demand.&rdquo;Salesforce VP of Product Marketing Gordon Evans told <u> <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/cmo-s-guide-marketing-automation/294524/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ad Age </a></u> that marketing automation is about &ldquo;engaging customers on any channel or device with an orchestrated approach based on data.&rdquo; Improving efficiency in communications between prospects, customers and companies is part of the allure, but the magazine also cites the following reasons why companies need to invest in marketing automation software now:&ndash; Better capability to personalize content: Enables you the ability to send out automated emails when customers take certain actions on your website, like visiting a particular product page, abandoning a shopping cart or downloading a free report. These timely communications keeps your brand fresh on a prospect&rsquo;s mind and provides more buying decision information when it matters most. In a nutshell: sales and upsells increase.&ndash; Improved B2B relationship management: It&rsquo;s estimated that more than half of a B2B buyer&rsquo;s decision making process is done before they reach out to sales. Buyers are learning as much as they can before contacting companies. With marketing automation, you can indirectly guide the flow of information and make prospects more comfortable buying from you.&ndash; Insight on how far along a prospect is in the sales cycle: Get insight into where a prospect has been on your website and how closely aligned a prospect is with your core demographic. Does this person meet all the demographics of people who typically buy from you? Has this person been to your pricing page? Should you send a special offer? Or does this prospect need more information before receiving a sales offer?&ndash; Base analysis on cross-channel trends: Make predictive analysis based on sound data regarding which channels give you best bang for your buck. See which actions are most predictive of sales opportunities.You might like: <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-use-marketing-automation-generate-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  8 Ways to Use Marketing Automation to Generate Leads </a></u><a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hatchbuck.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"hatchbuck content grid\" src=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hatchbuck.png\"/></a>Image Source: <u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/hatchbuck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hatchbuck.com </a></u><h3> 4.

{"original_id":2603,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Treat Employees Better Than Customers","link":"treat-employees-better-than-customers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> \"Treat employees better than customers.\" <br/> <br/> What? Isn't that sacrilegious?  <br/> <br/> There's a huge debate in life: what came first, the chicken or the egg? In business, the debate is: who comes first, the customer or the employee?  <br/> <br/> The answer is more obvious than it might seem: it must be the employee, even if it's just slightly more first than customers. <br/> <br/> Why? <br/> <br/> There is a clear and solid linkage between the employee experience and the customer experience that is solidly supported by data and statistics. The problem is, many companies still refuse to make the employee experience a priority, focusing instead on stakeholder value, the bottom line, and/or the customer experience without considering the implications of a poor employee experience on all of the above. <br/> <br/> What gives? <br/> <br/> Perhaps we don't want to just \"treat employees better;\" maybe it's more about doing right by employees and putting just as much, if not slightly more, effort into the employee experience. Right now, that's not happening nearly often enough, if at all. <br/> <br/> Too many executives have the mindset that they'll focus on the employees and their experience \"later.\" This isn't healthy. Without your employees, you have no customer experience. Remember, people buy from people. The linkage between customer experience and employee engagement has been proven. It's real, and your employees matter! If your employees aren't engaged, it will be very difficult for them to delight your customers; in very simple terms, this describes the spillover effect, defined as &ldquo;the tendency of one person&rsquo;s emotions to affect how other people around him feel.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> So where do you begin? How do you ensure that the employee experience within your organization is optimal?  <br/> <br/> When it comes to designing a great employee experience, the steps are really not much different from designing a great customer experience: we must first understand - because we cannot transform something we don't understand. So we start with employee understanding. I would recommend that you start that understanding phase/exercise with the candidate experience and then understand how that bleeds into the employee experience, should the candidate choose to accept your offer. <br/> <br/> How do we do that? There are three steps that become the foundation for designing a great employee experience. <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Develop employee personas. </strong> <br/> Personas are fictional characters and create realistic representations of the most significant employee groups. They are derived through both qualitative and quantitative primary research and include vivid narratives, images, and other details that help companies understand the needs of their employees; they also outline motivations, goals, behaviors, challenges, likes, dislikes, objections, and interests of the employees. To humanize and to bring the persona to life, so people can clearly relate, give each one a human face and name. <br/> <br/> The personas will likely include details about department, tenure, career goals, age, interests outside of the immediate job at hand, and more. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Map the employee journey for a variety of tasks that employees do every day </strong> <br/> Journey mapping creates awareness for the steps that an employee takes to do whatever it is that he's trying to do within the organization. Take a look at major tasks, likely identified as a result of employee feedback (from surveys, suggestions boxes, conversations with managers, stay interviews, exit interviews, etc.), that you want to map, conduct mapping workshops, talk to employees about the steps they go through to do each task, and identify key moments of truth. These maps must be created in the employee voice and validated by employees. <br/> <br/> Maps really brings the employee experience to life, allowing company leadership to understand what employees are going through as they complete some task, as well as to create that empathy that is equally important to creating a great employee experience as it is to creating a great customer experience. Maps will facilitate a culture transformation - to employee-centric and customer-centric. <br/> <br/> Check out the webinar I did with Intradiem's VP of Marketing, Kyle Antcliff, for more details about employee journey mapping. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Listen to employees and incorporate their feedback into experience and process improvements </strong> <br/> There are a lot of ways to listen to employees, as I noted above: from surveys to suggestion boxes to conversations to stay interviews.  The important thing is, when you capture their feedback, you must act on it - you must do something with it. Nothing frustrates employees more than when they tell their managers that something is wrong or takes too much effort, and managers don't really listen and certainly don't act on what they've been told. <br/> <br/> With those three foundational steps in place, you're equipped with the information you need to design and deliver a great experience for your employees. <br/> <br/> That's important because, when employees have a great experience with their employers, not only does it translate to a great customer experience but also leads to employees become raving fans of the brand and of the organization. Raving (employee) fans...</p><li> <p>  want to see the company succeed and grow </p></li><li> <p>  do whatever it takes to make that happen </p></li><li> <p>  provide feedback, good or bad, to support the business success </p></li><li> <p>  are more likely to stay </p></li><li> <p>  openly and actively recruit new employees </p></li><li> <p>  recommend their friends and family work for the company </p></li><li> <p>  share their joy and passion with customers (and other employees) </p></li><li> <p>  are more able to sell something they believe in </p></li><li> <p>  are company evangelists and spread the word about the brand </p></li><li> <p>  wear the brand and want to show that they are part of something bigger than themselves </p></li><p> <br/> Because of that enthusiasm and passion for the brand, for the business, employees are eager to contribute to its success. And when we're all working together for the success of the business, I believe that, ultimately, customers will win, too. As will your shareholders.</p><p> Treat fellow employees the way you want the customer to be treated - maybe even better. -Shep Hyken</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 15:40:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 15:40:14.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_A4MQadT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/treat-employees-better-than-customers/\", \"post_id\": \"5851\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 15:40:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 15:40:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"treat-employees-better-than-customers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5850\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2668\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chicken-and-egg.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"395\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441279800,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

She looked over at me and said, &ldquo;Mom, this article is about you.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Me? I&rsquo;m not an introvert,&rdquo; I said to her somewhat dismissively. And then after a few minutes I said, &ldquo;Wait, do you really think I&rsquo;m an introvert?&rdquo;</p><p> My daughter said, definitively, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p> I was shocked. I speak for a living in front of thousands, and do all sorts of things that I would think would be categorized as extrovert-like traits. But after looking at the article, and considering the definitions, my daughter is right.</p><p> Although I have written about introverts in the book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118156285/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118156285&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=redzonemarket-20&amp;linkId=TMN4BW6KRULD5T7Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Connectors  </a> </u> , I still didn&rsquo;t associate the trait with myself. I even interviewed surprising introverts like Ivan Misner, founder and CEO of BNI, the world&rsquo;s largest networking organization, who shared a similar experience when his wife told him he was an introvert. But I didn&rsquo;t make the connection. I think the issue is the populous negative association made about introverts. The myth is that introverts are shy and antisocial, quiet and don&rsquo;t speak up, bookworms and nerds. And while they can be all of those things, there are also many outgoing introverts and, for that matter, lots of shy extroverts.</p><p> The WSJ article defines an introvert as someone who needs solitude to balance out social time, gains energy and processes information internally, and can focus on things for long periods of time. Extroverts, on the other hand, gain energy from being with other people, process information externally-sometimes by talking through problems, and will promote and network.</p><p> I think great companies need a diverse workforce of both introverts and extroverts to be truly successful.

I know the public has more financial articles, blogs, internet pages, mailers, seminars, and total noise presented from or by financial planners, brokers, insurance professionals, pretend financial gurus, and other media noise that probably confuses clients on what financial services should they be looking for and what questions should they be asking?</p><p> Because of unpredictability of life and the complexity of financial markets and global economy, it is important to work with a financial advisor who will help you to achieve your financial and life goals and aspirations. The financial life planning process will truly understand you before the numbers along with your concerns and dreams. The process also includes understanding your unique set of values, priorities, challenges, and opportunities in order to assist in providing the appropriate financial and personal recommendations and strategies. This leads us to the real definition of Financial Life Planning:</p><p> &ldquo; Financial Life Planning  is a holistic process that puts the clients interests first and focuses on increasing a clients sense of financial well-being and life satisfaction. Initially, this process will help a client clarify their values, priorities, circumstances, and aspirations; and then guide a client in defining and designing a unique version of the rich life. In addition, Financial Life Planning will increase a clients understanding of the habits and attitudes that will facilitate their financial and life goals to support successful life transitions. Simply put, Financial Life Planning is understanding YOU before the numbers!&rdquo;</p><p> Further articles will analyze differences of financial services offered by financial advisors, the questions clients should consider asking during their interview process along with advisor compensation for the financial services they provide to clients and how to evaluate your cost versus your service return.</p><p> Many thanks to Amy Mullen from Money Quotient for her valuable insight into and wonderful research and articles about creating Financial Life Planning and Hugh Massie at DNA Behavior International for providing insight into a clients learned versus natural behavior and why understanding the client before the numbers is changing the financial services approach and behavioral processes.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 15:52:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 15:52:33.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_q1gdfnB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-is-financial-life-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"5855\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 15:52:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 15:52:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-is-financial-life-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5856\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2670\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1_1.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"412\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441296000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

By doing so your time becomes more productive and much more profitable.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how effective marketing makes your time more productive and helps boost your earning capacity.</p><h3> Understand the Typical Needs of Your Ideal Client</h3><p> <br/> If your ideal client type is high net worth their needs may relate to:</p><li> Taking care of their Family</li><li> Preserving and protecting their wealth</li><li> Mitigating their Tax</li><li> Finding a trusted partner to manage their wealth <br/>  </li><p> By using the needs of your target client type you can tailor your firm to solely focus on addressing their needs, therefore becoming an attractive proposition to them.</p><h3> Draw Clients to Your Firm</h3><p> <br/> By focusing on a set client type your message can become much more specific. Consumers seek out firms who specialise in the services they want. They want to work with the experts, and the firms who know the client type they want are able to develop and publish the type of content that attracts their interest.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to remember, consumers don&rsquo;t relate to industry worded material, they want to see content that helps them understand the benefits they can get from a service.</p><h3> Use Content In-Line with Inbound and Automated Marketing </h3><p> <br/> In essence, this method of marketing is about:</p><li> Finding out more about the type of client you want</li><li> Creating content that will appeal to their needs and wants</li><li> Distributing this content on the channels they can be found</li><li> Capturing their attention and their interest</li><li> Utilising downloadable offerings to capture their details</li><li> Using emails to deliver personalised content offerings and tailored information</li><li> Nurturing their interest from curiosity stage, to sales ready stage. <br/>  </li><h3> Score Your Leads on the Data Gathered</h3><p> <br/> The data provided through inbound marketing and automation software means you can create a lead scoring system that enables you to accurately assess the quality and progress of each lead you have generated. You can then discard the leads who have shown little interaction. You can also single out the leads who have shown more interest in a certain service than others and target them with more specific, personalised content.</p><h3> Only Engage with Sales Ready Prospects</h3><p> <br/> The sales ready leads created through this process have already built up a trust in your firm before they have even spoken to you. This is because the content they found helpful and the offerings they continued to download have distinguished your firm as a source of knowledge and expertise. </p><p> When ready, your prospects will contact or request to be contacted. And when it comes to engaging with these prospects they already view your firm as their obvious choice, making it much easier to secure their custom.</p><p> From a recent analysis of 30 small firm clients we found that we increased our clients annual sales turnover by &pound;126K for an initiial year one investment of &pound;11,400. (Please note econnexx are paid 20% of this as a performance related fee).</p><p> Feedback from these firms attributed the success to the following:</p><li> focus on a target market</li><li> increased content distribution and email marketing</li><li> gaining trust from potential clients through content marketing</li><li> focusing on sales ready leads. <br/>  </li><p> The financial advisers/firms who choose to benefit from the most effective  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/how-to-get-more-site-visitors-and-better-leads-in-the-financial-sector\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial services marketing  </a> </u>  methods available will see significant, long lasting benefits.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 15:59:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 15:59:31.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_etrV7Hy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-financial-advisers-can-increase-their-earning-capacity/\", \"post_id\": \"5858\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 15:59:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 15:59:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-financial-advisers-can-increase-their-earning-capacity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5857\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2671\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441035573579-1825ff12fc2a.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"593\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441536300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2607,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When A Client Dies...","link":"when-a-client-dies","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As an advisor to older couples, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll face the death of a client at some point and in many cases that death will be the husband&rsquo;s. What&rsquo;s more, you may not have a strong relationship with the wife. Remember: 70% of widows leave the family&rsquo;s financial advisor.</p><h3> The wife calls to let you know &ldquo;Harry died.&rdquo; What do you say? What do you do?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  React and listen. </strong> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shocked, Helen. What happened?&rdquo; Encourage her to tell you all she wants. According to John Gray (Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus) &ldquo;Tell me more,&rdquo; is always a good way to deal with a woman in a stressful situation.</p><p> <strong>  Offer personal support. </strong> &ldquo;Lots of things will be happening in the next week. Take the time you need and only do those things that are absolutely necessary. Lots of things can wait. What&rsquo;s more people want to help at times like these so reach out to them and me.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Be specific with how you can help. </strong> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be happy to drive people around / house sit / walk your dog / organize meals for the family. What would be helpful right now?&rdquo; Be a friend rather than a financial advisor.</p><p> <strong>  Bring her peace of mind. </strong> &ldquo;There are financial matters that will need to be taken care of. I know what they are and when they need to be handled. I won&rsquo;t let anything get behind. And nothing needs to be handled in the next few weeks so leave it to me to bring them up to you as they need to be dealt with.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Reassure her. </strong> &ldquo;Thank you for calling me. Harry told me how important it was to him to make sure you&rsquo;d be okay in the short and long term. I will do whatever I can to make it easier for you to know and understand what&rsquo;s going on. Leave it to me to be in touch in a couple of weeks and we can sit down when the time is right and go over the more immediate matters.&rdquo;</p><h3> Be the Expert in Transitions</h3><p> <br/> But we get ahead of ourselves. Are you likely to be one of the few people the wife is likely to call when her husband dies? If you&rsquo;re not, you should be. So start forging relationships with the wives of your couple clients now before its too late.</p><li> Make it a point to be the advisor who knows where everything is or better still hold all the documents: will, estate plan, end of life wishes, etc. Such a service is valuable and will be appreciated by every client, even if they don&rsquo;t use it.</li><li> Make sure people in your office likely to take a call related to a client death know how to handle the call and take immediate action by getting you to call personally.</li><li> Next make sure you have a process in place for when clients die and train your staff on how to execute: what needs to be dealt with, by when and what information is required. Create the checklist and keep it up to date.</li><li> Educate yourself about the grieving process and how to respond to the people affected. Consider development courses, books and and online resources. Become the expert in transitions. It adds to your value and creates a point of differentiation. <br/>  </li><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s plenty of value to clients for advisors who are experts in life&rsquo;s transitions. When a client dies, be a friend to the wife rather than an advisor, have a process in place familiar to your staff and create a checklist of all financial matters that have to be dealt with and the timing for each. </p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

You get what I mean. There&rsquo;s a surplus of startup tips and suggestions.</p><p> However, these tips, suggestions, and reminders are nothing, really, without a step by step guide. For example, say you envision the best apple pie there is. You know you have to use flour, water, eggs, milk, and, oh yes, the apples, but if you don&rsquo;t have the recipe, the idea of a pie stays just that, an idea of a pie. Will you ever be able to taste the apple pie if you don&rsquo;t find out how much of each ingredient you need, or how long it needs to stay in the oven? Not likely.</p><p> Will you ever see your startup if you don&rsquo;t create the step by step recipe for your business?No.</p><p> Below are KEY actionable ideas (or recipe starters) that business owners need to consider when developing their business idea. And I mean it. These are absolutely key:</p><li> <strong>  Create a goal, and then a strategy to meet it. </strong></li><li> <strong>  You need to EXCEED &ndash; not just meet &mdash; the needs of your customers. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Create a great product and sell it at a competitive price. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ask yourself: Why should a customer buy your product? How is it different from anything else out there? Why would they care about it? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ninety percent of first impressions are made in the first 30 seconds. Make those 30 seconds count. Less is always more. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Your business must have an internet presence. Internet retailing is growing 15-20 % per year while brick and mortar retail is only growing 1-3 %. No explanation needed. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Empower your staff and management to fix customer problems whether your company is right or wrong. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Follow the 80-20 rule with forecasting profits: 80 percent of sales come from 20 percent of a company&rsquo;s products or services. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Measure and adapt. Measure and adapt.

{"original_id":2609,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Best Bait You've Got For Nabbing Top Talent","link":"the-best-bait-youve-got-for-nabbing-top-talent","source_link":null,"content":"<p> While job search engines and commercial boards continue to be important sources of new talent in the digital age, reputation is proving an increasingly powerful recruiting tool. Consider the findings of the  <u>  2015 Source of Employment Survey Report </u> , which interviewed job seekers between 2006 and 2014. In 2006, when asked how they found their last job, respondents gave the following top answers:</p><li> 31.7% responded to an ad posted on a commercial job board</li><li> 11.6% got a tip from a family member or friend</li><li> 9.5% responded to a newspaper ad <br/>  </li><p> In 2014, the top answers were:</p><li> 24.5% responded to an ad posted on a commercial job board</li><li> 12.8% referred by an employee of the company</li><li> 11.3% got a tip from a family member or friend <br/>  </li><p> Note that tips from family and friends maintained roughly the same percentage, while the percentage of people who responded to job board ads actually decreased. And we see a new top answer surfacing: referrals by current employees. The number of people finding jobs through word of mouth is on the rise, so don&rsquo;t undersell the importance of using your company&rsquo;s reputation to recruit.</p><h3> Using Your Inside Reputation</h3><p> <br/> Your employees are one of your biggest recruiting assets. After all, they know what it&rsquo;s really like to work for your company. They&rsquo;re immersed in the culture, so they can speak to the perks of your workplace. Insider knowledge is powerful, so encourage them to share that insider knowledge with prospective candidates:</p><li> <p>  <strong>   The power of referrals:  </strong>   Offer incentives for passing on prospective candidates. These could take the form of anything from financial compensation to a work-from-home day. Make employees understand that they can gain by referring someone they know. </p></li><p> You can also leverage employees&rsquo; insider knowledge to build your company&rsquo;s public reputation:</p><li> <strong>  Have fun with social media: </strong>  Use your social media channels as a platform for employees to share their positive experiences in their workplace. Invite them to post on your Facebook page, Twitter account, or Pinterest boards. </li><li> <strong>  Straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth: </strong>  Include a section for employee testimonials on your website, or create a recruiting video that shows employees engaged and invested in what they do.   <br/>  </li><h3> Using Your Outside Reputation</h3><p> <br/> A myriad of factors contribute to your company&rsquo;s public persona, but branding is one of the most foundational. Simply put, branding means creating a definable, recognizable identity. It encompasses your company&rsquo;s mission statement, as well as the many other ways you present yourself. Every company has a brand, and you can set your company&rsquo;s apart by making it undeniably clear to a prospective candidate:</p><li> <strong>  Less isn&rsquo;t always more: </strong>  Many job postings don&rsquo;t provide enough information about what a job seeker will contribute to should they join the company. Add blurbs about what your company stands for to job postings on search engines, commercial boards, and social media platforms. When job seekers can pin down what you&rsquo;re about, they&rsquo;ll be more likely to find that vision attractive too.</li><li> <strong>  Bolster home base:  </strong> Make sure your company website has an equally succinct and compelling summary of your mission statement and unique offerings in the industry. Many candidates will check out your website during their application process, so it should represent you well. <br/>  </li><p> By focusing on branding your company to potential candidates, you bolster your reputation, and thus the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll pursue a job with you.      </p><p> This is just one of the recruitment strategies that should be in your toolbox. But the bottom line here? Reputation has a considerable impact on drawing top talent. Stay attentive to it, and you take advantage of major recruiting opportunities.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 18:47:37.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 18:47:37.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_kh2QMEN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-best-bait-youve-got-for-nabbing-top-talent/\", \"post_id\": \"5864\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 18:47:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 18:47:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-best-bait-youve-got-for-nabbing-top-talent\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5863\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2674\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Depositphotos_50543457_xs.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"557\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441288800,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2610,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Why Your Website Will Never Be Successful.","link":"5-reasons-why-your-website-will-never-be-successful","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patosins\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Patrick Osinski  </u> </a></p><p> There are currently more than 1 billion live websites. In the time you&rsquo;ve taken to read this sentence, four new websites have been created. With the proliferation of websites it&rsquo;s difficult to stand out among competitors and businesses are increasingly challenged to leave a unique mark in the rapidly evolving Internet landscape. This, in addition to the fact that we&rsquo;re in the middle of an information overload, makes it easy to lose sight of the basics that make a good website. A website should tell a story and communicate information seamlessly to the end-user, otherwise it runs the risk of turning visitors off completely. <br/> <br/> Below are five reasons that your website will never be successful and basic tips companies should keep in their back pocket and utilize in order to prevent their websites from becoming uninteresting and outdated. </p><h3> 1. Lacks Usability</h3><p> <br/> A website can often be the first impression of a company and a confusing website will push potential customers away just as quickly as they landed on it. Users need to be able to find what they are looking for with easy-to-navigate pages and readily accessible information that promotes further exploration. A clean layout with clear headers and information displayed in a user-friendly way encourages repeat visitors to frequent the site and obtain the information effortlessly. </p><h3> 2. Information Overload</h3><p> <br/> A bunch of words staring at potential customers is a surefire way to get them to leave a website. Customers crave information but businesses need to be mindful not to over communicate main points. It&rsquo;s easy to upload copious amounts of text and images on a website to make sure all of the bases are covered but in many cases it&rsquo;s too much information that ends up overwhelming the user. Provide key information that customers are looking for and relay it in a way that&rsquo;s easy for them to digest. Write in short sentence and in bullets when possible. By presenting focused information in a logical way customers can address their questions sufficiently.</p><h3> 3. Poor Website Name</h3><p> <br/> Choosing a website name is one of the toughest parts of the branding process. Finding an available URL that aligns with the company&rsquo;s image and can be easily optimized for search rankings are essential factors to consider. Previously, a company was only recognizable if it had a .com domain extension but times are changing and with the onset of a number of generic top level domains (gTLDs) &ndash; like .business, .brand and .website &ndash; companies have the option to choose from a growing pool of extensions that are ideal for the company in the long term. A notable name creates a unique opportunity to align a company, individual or new product website to better reach the target audience. </p><h3> 4. No Call-To-Action  </h3><p> <br/> Unfortunately the work doesn&rsquo;t end once a customer gets to the site and sees a visually-appealing layout with easy-to-use tabs. There has to be a call-to-action (CTA) that encourages customers to go beyond &ldquo;window shopping&rdquo; and take the plunge by making a purchase either directly on the website or being able to search locations where the product is available. Service providers can ask customers to contact a representative to learn more or have a virtual assistant available online for questions. Smaller CTAs such as encouraging customers to follow the business on social media or sign up for email newsletters keeps both potential and existing customers up to date on the latest news. Making the site interactive and determining what the end result and call to action needs to be for the company&rsquo;s business model is crucial.</p><h3> 5. Not Mobile Ready</h3><p> <br/> Mobile growth has surged and more and more customers are accessing websites directly from their smartphones and tablets than ever before. Therefore it&rsquo;s critical that websites are mobile ready so customers can easily view the content on smaller screens. Customers have a short attention span so information should be easily readable regardless of what device they&rsquo;re viewing the website on. It&rsquo;s also important to ensure the website loads quickly on any device so sticking to simple HTML instead of flash may be ideal.</p><p> <br/> Websites are essential to a company&rsquo;s success and take a great deal of time and dedication to build and maintain. It&rsquo;s important that resources are dedicated to ensuring that this platform is constantly up to date and working correctly. Companies that use these tips when creating their websites will be pleased with the uptick in visitor traffic to their page and overall outcome of having a rich Web presence.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 20:10:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 20:10:13.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Q71w9CB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-reasons-why-your-website-will-never-be-successful/\", \"post_id\": \"5866\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 20:10:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 20:10:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-reasons-why-your-website-will-never-be-successful\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5865\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2675\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/truman.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"463\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441300500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2611,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Maintaining Financial Statements","link":"maintaining-financial-statements","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The financial statements that you maintain for your RIA firm, which include income statements, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, are powerful tools. Apart from the fact that they are a required to be maintained for books and records purposes, the data that they contain hold the key many other critical regulatory and practice management activities.</p><h3> RIA Financial Statements In a Nutshell</h3><p> <br/> Maintaining complete and accurate financials on your business simply makes good business sense. However, our primary purpose here is the maintenance of financial statements for compliance purposes, which may include:</p><li> Balance Sheet and Income Statement</li><li> Cash Journals - Documentation including cash receipts and disbursements, records, and any other records of original entry forming the basis of entries in any ledger</li><li> Banking Information - All checkbooks, bank statements, cancelled checks and cash reconciliations for your firm</li><li> Business Expenses - All bills or statements (paid or unpaid) relating to the business of your firm</li><li> Other Financial Statements - All trial balances, financial statements, and internal audit working papers relating to the business of the firm <br/>  </li><p> While maintaining proper financial statements is required in order to avoid regulatory sanctions, it can also be a useful tool for RIAs. Creating and reviewing financial statements on a regular basis can prove to be an indicator of the health of the firm. The financial statements can demonstrate that the firm is performing as intended and disclosed, or act as a tool to show areas where it can improve. Ensuring financial stability of a firm is an important step in gaining client and regulatory confidence. Proving to be solvent and possess secure financials could be the difference between gaining and losing clients, or spending more time with regulators during an exam.</p><h3> State Specific Requirements <br/>  </h3><p> Many of the regulations regarding financial statements for RIAs are dependent on the advisor&rsquo;s principal state of business. Along with SEC Regulators requiring specific actions regarding financial statements, each state also has specific requirements on the issue. As an advisor it is important to recognize your specific state&rsquo;s requirements in order to avoid unnecessary regulatory issues. Currently, there are states that require audited financial statements to be sent to their state regulatory agency each year. This applies only if the firm is registered with the state, and does not apply to SEC firms. </p><p> It is important to stay updated on your specific state&rsquo;s requirements in order to avoid unnecessary regulatory issues. Depending on the state, there may be minimum net worth requirements that are to be demonstrated through the financial statements. Where applicable, your firm&rsquo;s books and records archive should contain the necessary financial statements and audit results.</p><h3> Custody&rsquo;s Additional Burdens <br/>  </h3><p> When an advisor claims custody of their clients&rsquo; assets, there are additional rules and regulations to be aware of in regards to Financial Statements. Advisors that also act as Custodians may be required to submit an audited balance sheet at the end of the their fiscal year. This balance sheet must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and audited by a certified public accountant (CPA). The audit must also include the accountant&rsquo;s opinion and other qualified notes regarding the firm&rsquo;s financials. Custodian advisors must also provide clients with a quarterly account statement that outlines all of the activity of their funds in the given period.</p><h3> Through the Regulator's Eyes <br/>  </h3><p> Regulators expect RIA firms to maintain updated financial statements that are created in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Regulators have put an emphasis on monitoring the financial statements of newly-registered advisors. If they are not completed correctly, it is a sign that a further examination is needed. Compliant financial statements prove to the regulators that the firm is running effectively. Proper maintenance and submission, if required, of updated financial statements is one key way to avoid regulatory sanctions.</p><h3> CCO Best Practices <br/>  </h3><li> Do not approach financial statements as just a way to avoid regulatory sanctions. They are important at spotting financial irregularities which might benefit you.</li><li> Utilize financial statements as a powerful tool to indicate advisory effectiveness and compliance.</li><li> Always stay informed of specific state requirements, which may differ from SEC and other states&rsquo; regulations, for example: <li>  Alabama and New York require audited financial statements regardless of custody. </li> <li>  If the firm claims custody, the following states require annual audited financial statements: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Washington D.C, Florida, Hawaii, New Mexico and Oregon. </li> <li>  Other states may not require financial statements to be submitted at all. </li></li><li> Maintain accurate financial statements, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).</li><li> Claiming custody of clients&rsquo; assets will require an audit by an independent public accountant registered with, and subject to regular inspection by, the PCAOB.</li>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 20:14:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 20:14:33.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_oP0cqCi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/maintaining-financial-statements/\", \"post_id\": \"5868\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 20:14:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 20:14:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"maintaining-financial-statements\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5867\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2676\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/people-woman-coffee-meeting-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"3070\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441285200,"author_id":80,"chart_url":""}

Walk with purpose to the lectern. Don&rsquo;t amble.</p><p> 2. Get your speaking notes in order. (Using hard copy? Always have each page numbered so you don&rsquo;t lose your place if the papers get jumbled at the last minute.)</p><p> 3. Breathe.</p><p> 4.

Using a microphone? You should have tested the microphone in advance, but double check it now. Use your best voice to say, &ldquo;Good morning/afternoon/evening.&rdquo; Do not blow into the mike. Do not tap it.  Do not say &ldquo;Testing, testing, testing&rdquo;. Any doubts about the volume?

At first glance, this may seem to indicate that the offering of financial planning services is becoming less popular over time. However, the above chart is instead likely an example of  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\" target=\"_blank\">   survivorship bias  </a> </u>  which in this instance is the logical error of focusing on investment advisory firms that have &ldquo;survived&rdquo; and are still in business while overlooking firms that have gone out of business.</p><p> <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=64c2e3e3-0b41-4d24-a8ce-e8a60d719b51&amp;placement_guid=d51d1631-f03e-4c76-90c0-563a6aaad6be&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpE1pAdxHzMFchNjE00aN2gEtpTpmt5_-JdNmdtXaw6dPOvJfY35qPsONGAcqzI2nPWxFbuq4AXGGe90poE1zsrJevVTbrBF1PevtgII6ElxCVANLDROjySyt4CXEs4OhU-NhnBKgRyAohGGftOVlYIVR9t0cCNV5JLpOMw9L8Nh9vDg7V_at_CK_10JR7uGanv8PmozKpf9FpqajvHawbyBLXNsPg-kglI40C3Z7LFh2Bv7YbtMvhkz0-T4-m5aMLO5SDjRqubrkGqyBdAkjGQqJ2AQFVErf3aSFG0Ngf-PuqBbgtufabUxzl96mLcUV7r1FIYm7C0Da_TLhGA27cuTipwVlw&amp;hsutk=1a859e8c35c6c8efbb9dc23cdc4de418&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fria-firms-that-offer-financial-planning-are-surviving-and-thriving&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fria-firms-that-offer-financial-planning-are-surviving-and-thriving&amp;pageId=3282665050\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Ten Critical Features of an RIA Technology System  </u>    </a></p><p> In our observations,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-start-a-financial-planning-firm-and-register-as-an-ria-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA firms that offering financial planning  </a> </u>  tend to have a higher likelihood of success compared to those that do not. This is not to say that firms that offering financial planning services are guaranteed to succeed, however offering such services often indicates that a firm is focused on providing a more holistic service offering to clients.</p><p> According to our survey, 72% of RIA firms founded in 2008 presently offer financial planning services. Looking back though, it&rsquo;s more likely that back in 2008 at the time of the firms&rsquo; initial registrations, the number of total firms started in 2008 offering financial planning services was closer to the 56% figure observed for firms founded in 2014. In the six years between 2008 and 2014, a few events likely occurred:</p><li> Firms that did not initially offer financial planning services evolved to offer a more holistic service offering which today includes financial planning; and</li><li> A higher percentage of firms that did not offer financial planning went out of business compared to firms that did offer such a service. <br/>  </li><p> We plan to further test these assumptions in future studies. However, this study did reveal that firms that offer financial planning are more likely to experience exceptional growth compared to firms that do not as shown in the table below:</p><p> <img alt=\"AUM growth rates of RIA firms providing financial planning services\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmGrowthFinancialPlanning.png?t=1441119588652&amp;width=625\"/></p><p> <strong>  As shown above, nearly 50% of advisory firms that offer financial planning grew AUM at a rate of more than 30% during 2014. </strong> Similarly, firms that offer financial planning were less likely to have negative AUM growth in 2014.</p><p> Check back in the coming weeks as we continue to release more sneak previews from our upcoming investment adviser industry report on growth, technology, investment styles, and advisory fees.

You should introduce your adult children to your financial advisor once you have established a good working relationship. It will benefit all of you.Let&rsquo;s say that you have covered all of your financial bases properly and you have made a will and you have a power of attorney in place. You know the details of your estate and your assets and where all of your accounts are held.You have also thought about where you would like to live in retirement. Although you would like to continue to live in your own home as long as possible, you have some definite preferences about assisted living facilities which you have discussed with your financial advisor.</p><h3> Introduce Your Adult Children to Your Financial Advisor: Start a Conversation</h3>It&rsquo;s time to have the financial talk with your children, especially if you have named one or more of them to act as attorneys for you if you should become incapacitated. In that situation, your family is going to need all the facts and support it can get. Your financial advisor is an important part of the equation. He or she has already established a relationship with you (which may have lasted for several years). If your children have met your financial advisor, contacting him or her for help during this stressful time is going to be much easier than if the child has to introduce him or herself first and then explain the reason for the call.You may choose to share information about your estate and the contents of you will with your adult children as well. If your estate includes a bequest for a minor grandchild, the financial advisor can answer questions about how it would be handled until the child turns 19.<h3> Teach Good Financial Habits from a Young Age</h3>In the same way that parents teach their children that they should look after their health by getting regular checkups and consulting specialists as necessary, you should also be discussing the value of good financial health from a young age. Encourage your adult children to develop their own professional relationship with your advisor when they start earning money and accumulating assets.It&rsquo;s never too early for your children to start thinking about the kind of life they want to have. The difference between having a dream and a goal is that goals include plans. Make it easier to have the money talk by arranging a time when you, your advisor and your adult children can sit down together and get to know each other.

{"original_id":2615,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Reasons You Are Passed Over for a Promotion Despite Your Career Planning","link":"reasons-you-are-passed-over-for-a-promotion-despite-your-career-planning","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of the worst news you&rsquo;ll ever hear is that you have been passed over for promotion&hellip;again. Even if you have a follow-up discussion with your boss about what you didn&rsquo;t get the promotion you had thought you deserved, nothing can make you feel better. For sure, you don&rsquo;t have any idea what to do next, either.</p><p> The truth is, your boss also feels uncomfortable talking to you about why the management didn&rsquo;t favor you. But of course, he or she knows exactly why someone else was given the opportunity to advance in their career.</p><p> Below are the things that bosses find really hard to tell those employees who have been passed over for promotion:</p><p> <strong>  1) You Don&rsquo;t Have the Skills Needed for the Job </strong></p><p> Many employees believe that promotion decisions are based purely on an employee&rsquo;s performance in their current position or role. This is an important consideration, of course, but there are other things management considers when choosing someone for a higher position. You have to understand that being good at one thing doesn&rsquo;t always guarantee you will be good at another. Employers know this, so they promote those who have the skills required to do the job they will be promoted to.</p><p> If you want to be considered for a promotion, you have to first be familiar with the requirements for the position. Then figure out what skills you have and what skills you still need to improve on to be qualified for it. Talk to your boss, and let the management know that you are doing the necessary steps that will make you eligible for a higher position.</p><p> <strong>  2) You Lack the Necessary Soft Skills </strong></p><p> Soft skills are just as important as technical skills. Especially if you intend to move up to a management position, you need to have particular soft skills, such as diplomacy, conflict resolution, business communication, and others.</p><p> You may prepare for this by developing the soft skills you will be needing for the position you want. You may also consider becoming an informal mentor to a new member of the workforce. When you do this, your boss will notice your eagerness to lead, and he or she may seriously consider you for a promotion.</p><p> <strong>  3) You Are Not Good at Taking Feedback </strong></p><p> Nobody likes to be criticized &ndash; that&rsquo;s a fact. But as a professional, you have to learn how to take feedback positively and with an open-mind. Especially when the feedback is from the management, you have to consider it as their way of helping you become a better person and professional, perhaps because they can see potential in you.</p><p> Whenever you receive feedback, try really hard not to resist and defend yourself. Just take it in, and see what lesson you can gain from it.</p><p> <strong>  4) You Lack Initiative </strong></p><p> By taking the initiative to solve problems around the workplace, you can show that you care, not just about your own job and career, but specifically about the condition of the business and the people in it. It is not enough that you document every problem that you see. More importantly, you have to analyze the issues, and figure out a way on how you can improve the situation.</p><p> <strong>  5) You Expect to Be Promoted </strong></p><p> It is important that you realize that in today&rsquo;s competitive workplace environment, even tenure is not anymore a guarantee that you deserve a promotion. No matter how long you&rsquo;ve been with the company, you won&rsquo;t be considered for a higher position unless you have proven time and again that you are a contributor. Thus,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   part of your career planning should be how you will be an important part of an organization  </a> </u> , and you shouldn&rsquo;t just focus on what your organization could do for your career.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 20:38:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 20:38:13.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ESla3az.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/reasons-you-are-passed-over-for-a-promotion-despite-your-career-planning/\", \"post_id\": \"5876\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 20:38:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 20:38:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"reasons-you-are-passed-over-for-a-promotion-despite-your-career-planning\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5875\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2680\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/man-sitting-on-a-bench.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1220\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441307700,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2617,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Webinars Can Be the Building Blocks for Your Content Marketing","link":"how-webinars-can-be-the-building-blocks-for-your-content-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> 1. Webinars Necessitate High Quality Content</h3><p> <br/> You need to aim high with your webinar content, especially if the webinar is delivered live. Consider the eBook vs. the live webinar. While both live behind a registration form, eBooks get steady amounts of downloads over time.</p><p> With a webinar, you speak to a live audience who provides real-time feedback via comments, poll results and tweets. The webinar puts you &ldquo;under the gun&rdquo; to deliver a compelling show. Of course, you still need to spend the time and effort to create high quality eBooks. But because you need to deliver something extra-special for your live viewing audience, webinars serve as great anchors to your content marketing.</p><h3> 2. Webinars Facilitate A Content Calendar</h3><p> <br/> When deciding the day and time of your live webinar, you put a stake in the ground. If you do 1-2 live webinars per quarter (I know, some of you do much more), you&rsquo;ve established a date and time for each one.</p><p> Besides their own calendars (e.g. scheduled promotions, speaker training, rehearsal, etc.), webinars give you \"big events\" to plan content around. Once I&rsquo;ve mapped out DNN&rsquo;s webinar dates with Linda, I develop additional dates for pre-webinar blog posts (and perhaps an infographic), along with post-webinar blog posts and related content. I&rsquo;ll then figure out content campaigns that fall outside of the scheduled webinars.</p><h3> 3. Webinars Can Easily Be Repurposed <br/>  </h3><p> <br/> A good content marketer produces high quality content. A great content marketer produces high quality content at scale. To create a large volume of high quality content, you either need to hire an army or you need to be efficient with existing resources.</p><p> Let repurposing be your friend. Break down the component parts of a webinar to efficiently create new variations of the underlying content:</p><li> The video of the presentation (if applicable)</li><li> The audio of the presentation</li><li> The audio transcript (i.e. turn it into a blog post or eBook)</li><li> The slides</li><li> The presenter notes</li><li> The questions from the audience (and the answers!)</li><li> The poll results</li><p> Ideas and Tips for Using Webinars as Content Marketing Building Blocks</p><h3> 1. Build A Library on Slideshare</h3><p> <br/> At DNN, it started with a simple idea a few years back: let&rsquo;s create a SlideShare account, then upload the presentation from every single webinar going forward. In its first year of existence, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/dnnsoftware\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DNN SlideShare channel  </a> </u>  was in the Top 1% of all accounts on SlideShare (per an email that SlideShare sent out at the end of that year).</p><p> Our account was created in the second half of the year, so we achieved that elite status in less than six months. While we found success creating presentations originally for SlideShare, webinar presentations served as the bulk of our content.</p><h3> 2. Hyperlink Liberally in Post-Webinar Content</h3><p> <br/> As you create content after the webinar, be sure to hyperlink to the related content. If someone read your post-webinar blog post, it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;re interested in the on-demand replay or the slides, too. So add links to both of them. Be sure to share all of the related content across your social media channels: post-webinar blog post, on-demand replay and the SlideShare presentation.</p><h3> 3. Ask Third Party Presenters for Permission to Publish Slides <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s a good idea to invite experts and thought leaders to present some of your webinars. Part of our marketing budget at DNN is allocated to webinar speaker fees. When you do book an expert to speak on a webinar, ask permission to publish their slides to your SlideShare channel (hint: some speakers, such as industry analysts, may say \"no\").</p><p> For non-paid engagements, record the permission in an email. In paid engagements, write it into the contract. Third party content draws well on a vendor&rsquo;s SlideShare channel.</p><h3> 4. Create EBooks from Well-Attended Webinars</h3><p> <br/> If you had high attendance or engagement rates on a webinar, chances are the topic struck a chord. So cherry pick your best webinars and have an eBook created from it. Ride the momentum of that successful webinar and generate even more ROI.</p><p> One tactic that works well for me: hire a freelance writer to view the on-demand replay, then author the eBook. I ask the writer not to simply regurgitate the webinar. The writer is encouraged to \"riff\" on the webinar content and build upon it.</p><p> Often, it&rsquo;s useful to find professional writers who work outside of your industry. They&rsquo;ll bring a fresh perspective and are less inclined to include over-used industry jargon. You&rsquo;ll find the resulting work more readable.</p><h3> 5. Create a Roojoom to Follow Up on Webinar Topic</h3><p> <br/> *Note from Roojoom: You can also repurpose your webinar into a Roojoom. A few months ago, we hosted a webinar where we talked about the importance of putting content in context. Following the webinar, we gathered the video recording of the webinar, the slides, and all the links that were mentioned during the webinar into one Roojoom.  <u>  <a href=\"http://tracks.roojoom.com/r/10088/?mini-mode=false\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Visit this Roojoom  </a> </u>  to see how it turned out.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-02 20:52:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-02 20:52:41.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_zA4L4ZY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-webinars-can-be-the-building-blocks-for-your-content-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"5880\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-02 20:52:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-02 20:52:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-webinars-can-be-the-building-blocks-for-your-content-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5879\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2682\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/apple-iphone-smartphone-desk-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"680\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441280700,"author_id":138,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2618,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"12 Things to Do During College to Get the Life You Want","link":"12-things-to-do-during-college-to-get-the-life-you-want","source_link":null,"content":"<p> According to the Institute of Education Services, over 21 million students will attend an American college or university this year. Assuming there are roughly twice as many nail-biting parents concerned their sons and daughters might complete their education four years older and none the wiser, I&rsquo;d like to offer some ideas to help maximize the benefits long after graduation day.</p><p> Before we get rolling, let&rsquo;s address what I consider the benefits of going to college. Keep in mind&mdash;everyday&mdash;these benefits only have a fighting chance of outweighing the cost ( <u>  Is the Cost of College Really Worth It? </u> ) if you practice achieving them! </p><li> Gain knowledge.</li><li> Learn to live as an adult.</li><li> Situate yourself for your first job.</li><li> Lay the foundation to enjoy a fulfilling career. <br/>  </li><p> Most people behave in a transactional manner as it relates to college&mdash;they put themselves through it to get a good, first job. That focus is not only shortsighted, but also causes the student to miss out on the most important long-term benefits of attending.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s have a look&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Pick the right college or colleges. </strong> This comes down to two areas&mdash;your interests and economics. If you were interested in engineering, don&rsquo;t attend Harvard when you can go to any one of dozens of other schools stronger in that area ( <u>  US News </u> ). You might also want to consider a junior college before hopping to a large, expensive university. The economics are better and you won&rsquo;t sacrifice any earning power once you&rsquo;re done.</p><p> <strong>  Choose the right major. </strong> Study what you love not what you think society considers acceptable. I&rsquo;m sure for some of you, your parents will be the issue. Sometimes Mom and Dad don&rsquo;t want to pay for the basket weaving degree. If that&rsquo;s the case, go as generic as possible (Business, Liberal Arts). In most cases, you won&rsquo;t use the specific knowledge you attained at school. You&rsquo;ll learn what you need to know while working for your companies. I studied Electrical Engineering and started my career in Information Technology consulting. My first duties required me to wear a tie and develop software in a language I&rsquo;d never seen before. Now, I wear pajamas to work, am a recruiter, and write books on employment. I&rsquo;m the norm not the exception.</p><p> <strong>  Question everything. </strong> It's easier to believe a lie you've heard a thousand times than a truth you&rsquo;ve heard once. I assure you, you will hear many lies. What you learn isn&rsquo;t ultimately a function of what they teach you. What you learn is ultimately your application of what the teachers are attempting to teach you. If what they teach you sounds peculiar, it probably is. Never forget that the only way our society makes progress is when someone does something differently. That someone needs to be you. Start building your courage now.</p><p> <strong>  Simulate real-life situations. </strong> You only get return on your investment if you can apply what you learn beyond your college years. That becomes easier to do if you prepare for it. Whether you reflect at the end of each class, midway through the semester, or at the end of the course, make sure to connect the dots between what you learned and how you think it can help you in life. If you can&rsquo;t figure out how to do this, you went to the wrong school or picked the wrong major or have a really bad teacher or some combination of all three. Go back to items one and two and start over.</p><p> <strong>  Seek opportunities to practice what you learned. </strong> The previous point focused on simulation, but this is about actually doing. Get a job in your field. If you can&rsquo;t, get a job that will teach you similar skills. If you can&rsquo;t do either of those, volunteer. Believe me, this item will likely yield the greatest dividends.</p><p> <strong>  Monitor your areas of interest and follow or connect with professionals in that space. </strong>  The sad fact is you will gain more knowledge and insight by following prominent leaders than sitting in your classroom reading the textbook. They are writing, speaking, or blogging about current events and issues. Follow them on sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Many of them have blogs to which you can subscribe. You can also follow companies and review their job. It&rsquo;s better to get a sense now of what that job actually entails than discovering it as an unhappy employee.</p><p> <strong>  Build your social media platform and keep it clean. </strong> It&rsquo;s never too early to show the world you are knowledgeable and fun. Check out  <u>  Your Social Media Platform: 7 Steps to Building a Strong Reputation </u> . You will also want to review  <u>  Time for a Social Media Shower? </u>  lest you&rsquo;ll need to deodorize those unflattering pictures.</p><p> <strong>  Get credentialed. </strong> If you&rsquo;re studying a major (Engineering, Information Technology, etc.) where you can get additional certifications, go get &lsquo;em. You should also seek training or other volunteering opportunities.</p><p> <strong>  Focus on the &ldquo;living&rdquo; part just as much as the &ldquo;learning&rdquo; part. </strong> Wake up. Make your bed. (Yes, make it.) Shower. Go to class. Play intramural sports. Go grocery shopping. Wash your clothes. Go to the campus bars. Join the clubs. Buy your girlfriend or boyfriend a gift. Repeat.</p><p> <strong>  Hang on to everyone&rsquo;s contact information. </strong> They&rsquo;ll be somebody someday and you&rsquo;ll likely need them. Trust me. Maybe you&rsquo;ll be somebody someday and you can help them. Hope for the latter. Plan for the former.</p><p> <strong>  Style your resume and keep polishing it. </strong> When you&rsquo;re eighteen years old, imagine the resume you&rsquo;d like to have when you&rsquo;re twenty-two years old. Write it now! Then actually do it and start filling it in. Consider it your list of goals for college. It&rsquo;s amazing how much you can achieve when you envision it and write it down.

{"original_id":2619,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Public Relations for Financial Advisors: Don't \"DIY!\"","link":"public-relations-for-financial-advisors-dont-diy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lexymmiller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Alexa Miller  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flackable\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Flackable  </u> </a>  </p><p> According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://fainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/GrowthbyDesign2014Excerpt.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FA Insight Study of Advisory Firms: Growth by Design  </a> </u> , sponsored by TD Ameritrade, only 50 percent of surveyed firms developed an annual marketing or public relations plan. Furthermore, the study found that just 32 percent of firms had an outside agency dedicated to public relations or new client growth. That group understands what hiring an outside agency can do for your financial firm.</p><p> Hiring an agency  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150827/FREE/150829916/are-pr-firms-worth-the-cost\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   comes with a cost  </u>  , </a>  so many advisors attempt a do-it-yourself or &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; public relations strategy to save money, but rarely do those efforts result in a tangible impact. Just as most people will visit a mechanic for auto advice or hire an attorney for legal council, when your public image needs work it&rsquo;s best to turn to experts. Let me explain why:</p><p> <strong>  Social Media </strong> <br/> <br/> The financial services industry has been slow to adopt social media for marketing and branding purposes. Subject to strict  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/investment/im-guidance-2014-04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   regulations  </a> </u>  regarding stakeholder communication, many financial firms and advisors have opted to stay away from the world of social networking.</p><p> By hiring the right outside public relations agency, particularly one specializing in financial services, you will have a partner to assist with developing compliant digital strategies, and you are also getting access to professionals who can implement effective social media strategies for your brand. With a unique ability to build an online audience, professionals with digital chops will embrace social media as an integral ingredient in your firm&rsquo;s overall marketing mix.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to note that not all public relations agencies offer  <u>  <a href=\"http://chelseakrost.com/social-media-is-a-game-of-chess-not-checkers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sophisticated social media guidance  </a> </u> . You can measure the depth of their abilities by examining their own social media presence, or lack thereof.</p><p> <strong>  Search Engine Optimization </strong></p><p> While on the hunt for a financial firm or advisor, potential prospects are heading online first. They want to explore a firm&rsquo;s media coverage, social media platforms and client testimonials. Public relations experts have studied the online user experience and understand what today&rsquo;s consumers are searching for. They can implement a digital strategy unique to your firm, including search engine optimization (SEO).</p><p> A public relations agency will help your firm climb the SEO ladder. Experts will help create opportunities to build SEO value through quality links to a site or specific content on a site. PR agencies have the unique ability to establish these quality link backs from high authority sites &ndash; bolstering SEO and referral traffic.</p><p> Creating, building and maintaining SEO does not happen overnight, it requires a certain amount of time and attention. Google is constantly changing the rules. If you don&rsquo;t have access to experts staying up to speed on these, your old SEO strategies could possibly get you in trouble and knock down your page rank.</p><p> Similar to social media, it is important to consider that not every agency is going to offer a digital strategy including SEO. Many traditional agencies have been slow to adapt to the new digital age.  When you are searching for the  <u>  <a href=\"http://flackable.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-pr-agency-for-your-financial-services-firm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best agency for your financial services firm  </a> </u> , make sure you grade their SEO &ndash; after all, a good agency should practice what they preach. </p><p> <strong>  Media Relations </strong></p><p> While many advisors are capable of doing of their own media relations, it would require an enormous amount of their time to build rapport with journalists. That time could be better utilized doing what they do best. Agencies generate earned media coverage for their clients on a full-time basis.</p><p> We live in an age where one sound bite can change a company&rsquo;s reputation, making it crucial to have expert communications council when engaging the media. An agency will ensure your campaign is properly composed, well pitched, newsworthy and directed to the right reporters, editors and producers. They know how to effectively follow-up to ensure reporters have all the information they need to craft a story about your firm and its services.</p><p> An earned media placement, such as being quoted as an expert in a news article, establishes third-party credibility for your brand. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.flackable.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flackable&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  president, Brian Hart, describes in his  <u>  Linkedin post </u> , third-party credibility has become crucial for advisors. A recent update to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/investment/im-guidance-2014-04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC guidelines  </a> </u>  highlights the &ldquo;importance, and scarcity, of third-party credibility within the advisor space,&rdquo; Hart explains.</p><p> Enhancing awareness is essential as firms look to validate their position in the market and attract new prospects. An outside agency will target reputable news outlets and arrange interviews opportunities with reporters at publications that require a public relations person to act as a liaison.</p><p> Prospective clients will discover these third-party articles while researching your firm.

{"original_id":2620,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Can Trauma Cause Genetic Changes?","link":"can-trauma-cause-genetic-changes","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Can the effects of trauma be handed down from generation to generation? Classical genetics says no: DNA is DNA; environmental challenges are not handed down. But reality turns out to be more nuanced. We now know that certain kinds of  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics\" target=\"_blank\">   epigenetic mechanisms  </a> </u>  can explain otherwise baffling effects seen in animal models as well as human populations.Two recent studies, one in mice and one in humans, shed additional light on how trauma responses can be handed down through subsequent generations.Scientists at Emory University in Atlanta recently  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/fearful-memories-haunt-mouse-descendants-1.14272\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   trained male mice  </u>    </a> to fear the odor of cherry blossoms by pairing the smell with an electric shock. Eventually the mice shuddered at the smell, even without shock. This is ordinary Pavlovian conditioning, of course, and is unsurprising. What's harder to explain is that the learned effect (of shuddering in the presence of cherry blossom odor) can be passed down. The conditioned mice's offspring, despite never having experienced cherry blossom odors before, exhibited increased sensitivity when introduced to the smell, shuddering more markedly in its presence compared with the descendants of mice that had been conditioned to be startled by a different smell or that had gone through no similar conditioning. A third generation of mice &mdash; \"grandchildren\" mice &mdash; also inherited this reaction, as did mice conceived through in vitro fertilization with sperm from males sensitized to cherry blossom.As explained  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/fearful-memories-haunt-mouse-descendants-1.14272\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in an article in Nature  </a> </u> : The researchers propose that DNA methylation &mdash; a reversible chemical modification to DNA that typically blocks transcription of a gene without altering its sequence &mdash; explains the inherited effect. In the fearful mice, the acetophenone-sensing gene of sperm cells had fewer methylation marks, which could have led to greater expression of the odorant-receptor gene during development. Acetophenone is the active ingredient of cherry blossom odor.The Emory University finding is important for humans, because a mechanism has been sought, for years, to explain a wide variety of intergenerational trauama effects observed in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/187555/trauma-genes-q-a-rachel-yehuda\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   families of Holocaust survivors  </a> </u> . (Some of the Holocaust-descenedant work, going back decades, has been summarized in the Trauma chapter of my book  <u>  Of Two Minds </u> .) The mouse model at least provides the possibility for further research to identify a definite DNA locus and a physical mechanism for intergenerational transfer of a well identified trans-generational effect.Further confirmation for the DNA-methylation theory comes by way of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223%2815%2900652-6/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent study in Biological Psychiatry  </a> </u>  showing changes (in Holocaust-survivor families) of one region of a gene (FKBP5) associated with the regulation of stress hormones, which is known to be affected by trauma. Researchers found epigenetic tags on the very same part of this gene in both Holocaust survivors and their offspring, whereas the same correlation was not found in any of the control group and their children.&ldquo;To our knowledge, this provides the first demonstration of transmission of pre-conception stress effects resulting in epigenetic changes in both the exposed parents and their offspring in humans,&rdquo; Rachel Yehuda, lead author of the Biological Psychiatry study, remarked. (An in-depth interview with Yehuda appears  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/187555/trauma-genes-q-a-rachel-yehuda\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .)Obviously, a great deal of work remains to be done, but at this point there is little doubt that integenerational trauma effects exist; the question is how to explain them biochemically.

Therefore you must have a message that intrigues her, one she can relate and connect to, and one that validates your commitment to helping women.</p><p> <strong>  Creating your compelling Introduction is about her, NOT you. </strong>  She doesn&rsquo;t care what you know until she knows that you care.</p><li> <strong>  Your compelling introduction starts with complementing her and identifying what&rsquo;s important to her. </strong>  By sharing the challenges she faces, and clearly articulating the value you provide you will immediately intrigue her, engaging her in further conversation and ultimately build the opportunity to add her as a client often inspiring referrals and introductions to her friends and family along the way. <br/>  </li><p> o when asked what you do the first step is to state what you do in a way that intrigues her to say &ldquo;What&rsquo;s That?&rdquo;</p><p> Let&rsquo;s be honest saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a financial advisor&rdquo; is really rather dull and does little to inspire further conversation. It&rsquo;s important that you articulate what you do in a way that is authentic and creates further curiosity.</p><p> In my former practice as a financial advisor my focus was women, when asked what I do whether asked by a man or a women I would share:</p><p> &ldquo;I manage wise women and wealth&rdquo;</p><p> This almost ALWAYS solicited the next question &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p><li> <strong>  Now you have the green light and can begin to articulate your value and understanding by saying something like: </strong> <br/>  </li><p> &ldquo;Well most of my clients are wise women in Newport beach who are now responsible for managing their financial future.

In fact, one of the most influential members of the Fed has already stated that with stocks swooning they likely won&rsquo;t raise rates after all.</p><p> That tells you everything you need to know about the Fed. They&rsquo;re not there for the economy; they&rsquo;re there to keep stocks in a bubble.</p><p> Through their interventions they&rsquo;ve created massive risks in the financial system, from which the tiniest elite has received disproportionate benefit.</p><p> Over the last four years, the top 80 billionaires saw their wealth increased by 50%, while the incomes for the rest of the population remained stagnant.</p><p> Adjusted for inflation, the average worker is actually far worse off than they were 15 years ago.</p><p> They are the ones who have had to suffer the consequences of the Fed&rsquo;s actions.</p><p> They&rsquo;ve endured gyrating financial markets, banks that are pitifully capitalized, and insolvent national pension funds&mdash;taking all of the risk, but none of the reward.</p><p> It might not be the worst of times, but with inequality rising, it&rsquo;s getting there.</p><h3> There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with inequality itself.</h3><p> <br/> There are no two human beings on the planet who are equal. In fact, even trying to strive for equality is both impossible and really boring.</p><p> We all have different talents and different productive abilities.</p><p> I&rsquo;m never going to run as fast as Usain Bolt, and I&rsquo;m just going to have to live with that.</p><p> The issue arises when people are able to disproportionately benefit without having to lift a finger at the expense of the rest thanks to a corrupt financial system.</p><p> When an entire class of people is able to grow wealthier to the tune of trillions of dollars, simply because central bankers print money and stick everyone else with the bill&mdash;that creates huge problems.</p><p> Right now, while the Fed is meeting in Jackson Hole, there is a group of activists also meeting there to protest against Fed policy.</p><p> 100,000 people have signed a petition telling the Fed not to raise interest rates.</p><p> They claim that the recovery has only helped Wall Street and the wealthy, whereas for the working class wages haven&rsquo;t gone up at all. And they&rsquo;re right.</p><p> But what is really sad about this is the fact they&rsquo;re begging the Fed to not raise rates until wages have gone up.</p><p> All these people have their hopes and dreams tied on a quarter of a percent.</p><h3> That&rsquo;s how ridiculous things have become.</h3><p> <br/> People are so horrified that if money isn&rsquo;t absolutely free that all hell will break loose&mdash;that people are going to go broke, the market&rsquo;s going to crash, and that there won&rsquo;t be any jobs.</p><p> That&rsquo;s a pretty sad state of affairs, and it is by no stretch of the imagination the foundation for a free and prosperous nation.</p><p> It is the height of central planning and it is a form of economic tyranny.</p><p> Fortunately, this system is on the way out.</p><p> Nations are going bankrupt, entire banking systems are nearly insolvent, and national pension funds are already broke.</p><p> Governments and central banks have backed themselves into a corner with no way out.</p><p> Just look at China: one of the most authoritarian governments in the world can&rsquo;t control its own market.</p><h3> And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so exciting.</h3><p> <br/> When everything they try isn&rsquo;t working, it&rsquo;s clearly time to hit the reset button.</p><p> And for those who are ready for it, this will bring a whole new world of opportunities.</p><p> Dickens closed his book with a poignant quote that I think it very fitting here:</p><p> &ldquo;I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 15:42:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 15:42:18.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_W1HMU5v.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/all-of-your-hopes-and-dreams-come-down-to-0-25/\", \"post_id\": \"5890\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 15:42:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 15:42:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"all-of-your-hopes-and-dreams-come-down-to-0-25\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5889\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2687\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-8.43.11-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"679\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441368000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

After all, they are usually the first introduction to your brand or company.</p><p> I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I have encountered unprofessional behavior from sales people who were calling on me as a business owner. Bad first impressions can ruin your  perception of a brand and the likelihood of you choosing that brand and working with that company will be lower. It&rsquo;s a fine line between persuasion and intrusion. Good sales people need to find that balance every single day, every single time they pick up the phone and every time they interact with a prospect.</p><p> Sometimes, the desire to sell is so high that courtesy goes out the window. Often, sales people want to impress with product knowledge rather than understanding the prospect&rsquo;s needs. Very often this is caused by pressure to meet numbers rather than building long-term relationships</p><p> <strong>  Finding a Fit </strong></p><p> So, how do you choose a sales person who will fit in with your organization&rsquo;s culture? Let&rsquo;s say you think you&rsquo;ve found the right candidate. You&rsquo;ve interviewed that person, so have others in your organization. You&rsquo;ve done reference checking, and everybody is more or less in agreement that you have a good match. Now, what can you and what should you do to objectively establish how good a fit they really are. The good news is there are a number of widely tested tools that can provide you with the kind of support you can readily use, without taking large chunks out of your day and your budget!</p><p> You can utilize tests such as the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, but also have a look into the Kolbe A Index, which you can administer to your entire team and then your candidate(s) to determine how well they fit and can work together with the other members of your team. You&rsquo;ll find the results can be real eye-openers!</p><p> <strong>  What Strengths Are Most Important? </strong></p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve found the right personality and work-type match, let&rsquo;s make sure everyone&rsquo;s working in the same direction. In our B2B environment today, standing out and becoming your clients&rsquo; provider of choice demands a comprehensive, solution-oriented or consultative sales approach, built around your own client-centric philosophy.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll want to examine your own sales process. Will your sales person need to do their own prospecting? Will they have to work with other team members to push a sale through the funnel? Being a door opener and/or a team player at the same time could present a challenge. Sales people always have at least one area of weakness and depending on your organizational DNA that will determine your hiring criteria. For example, if you have an inside sales team available, you can hire outside sales people who are strong relationship builders and closers.</p><p> As far as one area of sales competency is concerned, you need to make sure that your candidate is a good listener. That is something you can easily assess during the interviewing process. Pay attention to how many questions your candidates ask vs. the candidates tooting their own horn. You should also make sure that your candidate is a good writer because written communication is key to making connections today in the evolving use of social media and email communication. Here&rsquo;s another important step in the interviewing process. Before hiring sales people engage the candidates in phone conversations. In today&rsquo;s B2B environment almost all prospecting is done over the phone.  Sometimes people come across strong in-person, but their phone presence is weak.</p><p> <strong>  Assessing Sales Skills &amp; Knowledge </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;re getting closer now. Your candidate has good oral and written skills, has a good phone presence. But what about all the other areas of sales skills and knowledge that are essential to being a top sales person? We have worked with our research partners for many years to establish eight areas of sales competencies that have proven to be the foundation for the success of top sales professionals in a wide range of industries. So, how do you find out if your candidate possesses these competencies, and in which areas is there a need for improvement? Within our Consultative Sales Certification Training Program we have an integral element which is our initial Sales Skills &amp; Knowledge Assessment. We have all participants to work through this assessment before we conduct any training. This comprehensive assessment gives you a very detailed and measurable view of a sales person&rsquo;s skills and knowledge in the arena of solution-oriented or consultative selling. It also helps you understand if their strengths or opportunities to grow are in prospecting, overcoming objections, closing the sale, etc.</p><p> This assessment helps our clients hire the right people and after a successful completion of our sales training efforts we can test their consultative selling skills and knowledge again to gauge their improvement. We have found that even the best sales people have areas of improvement and the only way to measure is working off a set of well-established benchmarks.</p><p> Bottom line is that you can&rsquo;t hire the right person if you don&rsquo;t know what you are looking for and you can&rsquo;t measure success if you don&rsquo;t have a benchmark.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 15:51:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 15:51:07.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_bpah6uI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-hire-sales-people/\", \"post_id\": \"5892\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 15:51:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 15:51:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-hire-sales-people\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5891\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2688\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-8.54.15-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"484\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441364400,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}

But that doesn't necessarily mean that everybody's doing it well.</p><p> Business2Community recently reported that 70% of B2B marketers are posting more social media content than at the same time last year. But whilst that might be great for boosting website traffic, client engagement and lead generation, it can be a real headache for the marketing teams who have to constantly think of informative, relevant and entertaining things to write about.</p><p> Below are some of the ways that businesses can continue posting interesting and relevant content, which can help keep existing followers on side, as well as getting new people interested in what you have to say.</p><p> <strong>  Create images or infographics:  </strong> People love images, and B2B buyers in particular seem to love infographics.  So offer useful stats about the benefits of your product or service in a colourful, easy-to-digest infographic, and share it across you social media channels. One of the best sites I&rsquo;ve come across for creating images is  <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Canva  </u>  . </a></p><p> <strong>  Go behind the scenes: </strong>  Offering a behind-the-scenes look at the company - particularly using photos - will give your audience a better idea of your company culture, and show the 'human' side of your brand.</p><p> <strong>  Share user-generated content: </strong>  Get your clients to do some of the work for you! In the age of the review, people are keen to know what other people think about a product or service before being willing to try it themselves. So, ask fans or users to share pictures of themselves using your product or service; not only will they be endorsing what you do, but you'll be helping to build a wider brand community as well.</p><p> <strong>  Use your blog as an evergreen resource: </strong>  If you're stuck for things to say, go back through your blog archive and see if you can recycle any existing content in line with current trends. Be careful here though - this can be a risky move if not executed well, or if the subject is no longer relevant for your audience.</p><p> <strong>  Share FAQs: </strong>  Show your brand's helpful side by sharing commonly-asked questions along with detailed, informative replies. This could even sway a potential client or customer who had questions of their own and was visiting your social media pages to find out more.</p><p> Do you have any other suggestions as to how best to keep up with the never-ending need to create engaging social media content?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 15:56:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 15:56:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Xcoahle.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/running-out-of-things-to-say-on-social-media-try-these-ideas-to-help-feed-the-content-beast/\", \"post_id\": \"5894\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 15:56:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 15:56:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"running-out-of-things-to-say-on-social-media-try-these-ideas-to-help-feed-the-content-beast\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5893\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2689\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/twitter-birds.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"567\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441394100,"author_id":492,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2625,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"To Add Exceptional Team Members, Ask Great Interview Questions","link":"to-add-exceptional-team-members-ask-great-interview-questions","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You&rsquo;ve pored over dozens of resumes, scoured social media accounts and, finally, narrowed the field to just a few candidates for an important open position in your company. Next comes the most critical step in the process: the interviews.</p><p> Managers and human resources professionals can only tell so much about candidates by reviewing their credentials. Candidates who look great &ldquo;on paper&rdquo; can turn out in real life to be a poor fit for your company, and interviews provide the all-important face time.</p><p> The in-person interviews with your top candidates provide you with important visual cues about how an individual may perform. How is the candidate dressed? Does she seem nervous or evasive? How does he interact with your team? When you&rsquo;ve identified several candidates with similar skills, education and work experience, the interview can provide important missing information you need to make a final selection.</p><p> With interviews carrying so much weight in the hiring process, it&rsquo;s critical to ask compelling questions that get your candidates talking openly.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248524?ctp=BizDev&amp;src=Syndication&amp;msc=Feedly\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   As Entrepreneur notes  </a> </u> , asking the right questions can help you identify individuals with high levels of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245755\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   emotional intelligence  </a> </u> , which includes traits like self-control, persistence and the ability to get along with others. Employees with high EI are said to be able to adjust better to change, to be flexible and to work as part of teams.</p><p> Here are eight of the top questions that encourage your candidates to provide honest, open answers that can help you predict future success.</p><p> <strong>  Envision that it&rsquo;s a year from now; what has our team achieved? </strong></p><p> This question gives the candidate a chance to express her strategic vision and knowledge of your company. A thoughtful answer demonstrates that she&rsquo;s taken the time to learn about your challenges and to brainstorm solutions.</p><p> <strong>  Who do you consider a role model, and why? </strong></p><p> Choice of role model can tell you a lot about your candidate&rsquo;s level of introspection, and it can potentially give you an idea about what behaviors to expect,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/14-revealing-interview-questions.html?cid=sy01301\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   as Inc. notes  </a> </u> . It also reveals the character and attributes your candidate wishes to emulate.</p><p> <strong>  If you launched a new business, what would you want to be its three top values? </strong></p><p> This question provides you with insights into a candidate&rsquo;s priorities,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248524?ctp=BizDev&amp;src=Syndication&amp;msc=Feedly\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   notes Entrepreneur  </a> </u> . Understanding that candidates may be surprisingly candid in interviews, you want to hear answers like &ldquo;trust,&rdquo; &ldquo;integrity,&rdquo; &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair play.&rdquo; Values that wouldn&rsquo;t be a fit with your corporate culture and ethics should give you pause.</p><p> <strong>  What aspects of your past jobs have you not enjoyed? </strong></p><p> All candidates expect to be asked about their strengths and weaknesses. But asking specifically about parts of their current or previous jobs that they didn&rsquo;t like can result in honest answers. No one enjoys everything about any job, despite what applicants will say in interviews. Understanding your candidate&rsquo;s likes and dislikes will help you determine if the individual will be a good fit for your specific job opening.</p><p> <strong>  Tell me about a lasting friendship you&rsquo;ve developed in a job </strong></p><p> Building relationships only happens over time and with sustained effort, and it is a marker for high emotional intelligence. With this question, you learn how much your candidate values other employees as people, and it can give you an idea of your candidate&rsquo;s level of commitment to team members.</p><p> <strong>  What skill or expertise should you develop? </strong></p><p> No one has mastered every possible skill, and you want to hear that your candidate is curious and has a desire to continue learning and improving in his field. If an individual doesn&rsquo;t have an answer, you can take it as a sign that he doesn&rsquo;t feel he has anything left to learn.</p><p> <strong>  Describe a time in a job when things didn&rsquo;t go the way you&rsquo;d hoped </strong></p><p> By asking about something that didn&rsquo;t go well, you can gather information about your candidate&rsquo;s tendencies as a self-starter and whether she views challenges as permanent setbacks or opportunities for growth. You also may learn whether your candidate is a team player or would point a finger of blame at colleagues.</p><p> <strong>  What are your questions for me? </strong></p><p> Providing your candidate with an opportunity to ask you questions can tell you how much she prepared in advance or how well she thinks on her feet. It also can give you an idea of the innovative &mdash; or potentially disruptive &mdash; ideas your new employee will bring to the table.</p><p> <strong>  To uncover valuable information, ask the right interview questions </strong></p><p> Few decisions are as important to your organization as the employees you hire. By asking compelling, open-ended questions, you can uncover your candidates&rsquo; emotional intelligence levels and improve your chances of adding strong team members.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 15:59:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 15:59:46.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_VBD7LsP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/to-add-exceptional-team-members-ask-great-interview-questions/\", \"post_id\": \"5896\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 15:59:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 15:59:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"to-add-exceptional-team-members-ask-great-interview-questions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5897\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2690\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pexels-photo-large_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"548\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441371600,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2626,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Ways to Wipe Out Your Retirement Savings","link":"10-ways-to-wipe-out-your-retirement-savings","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Want to make what you think is a smart investment decision, and lose your life savings? I can show you how. </p><p> After 18 years in the investment industry, I've watched people lose money in almost every way imaginable. The most devastating losses are what I call Code Red losses; the kind you can't recover from.</p><p> Code Red losses can be avoided. It takes a little knowledge &mdash; and a lot of common sense. Eight of the 10 investment decisions below are Code Red mistakes; two aren't. </p><p> Read on to learn how to recognize a Code Red investment decision:  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Believe in a stock </strong></p><p> The company you work for is doing well. You understand the potential of the business. You should own a lot of company stock. After all, it shows your level of commitment, right?</p><p> For several years I worked in a CPA firm that had a lot of clients who worked for Intel. One of the Intel executives owned 150,000 shares of Intel. At the time Intel was trading at about $73 a share. This persona had $11 million &mdash; the majority of their wealth &mdash; in a single stock. Although some of it was restricted stock, the majority of the shares could be sold at any time. </p><p> We had numerous discussions about the risk of holding so much wealth in a single stock. To our dismay, our advice fell on deaf ears. Feeling helpless, we watched Intel go down, and down. For the last year it has been trading in the low to mid 20s. At $22 a share the same 150,000 shares are worth $3.3 million. Three million is still a decent sum of money, but it won't deliver the standard of living that $11 million will.</p><p> You can lock in lifestyle by taking risk off the table. If trusted advisers are telling you to reduce risk, listen. You can't take your \"belief\" in your company stock to the bank. Owning a lot of company stock doesn't demonstrate a commitment to your company; it demonstrates a lack of commitment to your own personal financial planning. </p><p> Code red? Yes.</p><p> <strong>  2. Buy an annuity &mdash; as an Investment </strong></p><p> An annuity is a good investment, right?</p><p> An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. Insurance is a risk management tool &mdash; not an investment. When you buy an annuity, you are insuring a particular outcome, not making an investment. The key to using an annuity properly is to understand what you are insuring and to know the cost of that insurance. An annuity can be a great risk management tool, but don't confuse that with investing.</p><p> Some variable annuities allow you to invest in mutual fund-like accounts within the annuity, but there is an insurance wrapper surrounding the outcome; the insurance wrapper is promising either a particular guaranteed outcome upon your death (death benefit guarantee) or a specific amount of future income you can draw out (a living benefit guarantee). </p><p> I've watched too many people buy a variable annuity because they misunderstood how the guarantees worked. Several years after purchase they find out it doesn't quite work the way they thought it did and some erroneously cash out the variable annuity at that point, losing themselves many thousands of dollars.</p><p> You should evaluate annuities as a way to secure sustainable income in retirement &mdash; but don't buy them for their investment potential. Buy them to insure an outcome.</p><p> Code Red? No. You might get locked into a product that wasn't the best option for you, but you're not likely to lose 90% of your net worth with this choice.</p><p> <strong>  3. Get reeled into real estate </strong></p><p> Rental real estate is a good way to build wealth with someone else's money, isn't it? I mean, that's what the infomercials say.</p><p> In 2007, one of my good friends owned 12 rental properties with a cumulative value of over $3 million; within a few years all but one were lost through short sale or foreclosure. Then a long process of rebuilding wealth began.</p><p> This investor is a smart cookie, holding an executive position with a publicly traded company. She went to numerous workshops on real-estate investing. What went wrong? </p><p> She violated one of the first rules of real-estate investing: It takes deep pockets. When the economy goes down, renters can move out, leaving you with a mortgage payment and no income available to make these payments. If you don't have the cash flow to cover the mortgage as well as repairs and maintenance, you'll lose the property.</p><p> Investing in real estate is a profession in and of itself. With real estate prices on the rise again, don't get reeled in with the lure of easy passive income. It isn't as easy as it looks.</p><p> Code Red? Yes.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Follow a Tip </strong></p><p> An opportunity to double your money is an investment opportunity worth pursuing. It could change your life, right?</p><p> Many years ago a well-educated friend of mine began telling me about a stock he had been investigating. It was poised for big things. He had been to the shareholder meetings and reviewed the financial statements. He was convinced within a few years the value would triple. It was a penny stock. I bought in. When the price went down, I bought some more. Today, my thousands invested are worth a few hundred. I still own shares as a reminder to myself of how easy it is to lose money. </p><p> Did I make an investment? No, I gambled, and I lost.</p><p> In her book, &ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; Susan Cain tells the story of a man who bought GM stock during the market crash, thinking he could double his retirement savings. He felt safe with the investment because he had heard through reputable sources that the government would bail the company out. When the stock continued to go down, he bought some more. When it went down again, he bought more. As it bottomed out he realized he'd invested nearly his entire life savings. He panicked and sold it. Soon thereafter, the stock recovered. His life savings, however, are forever gone.</p><p> Tips are great for your waiter or waitress. But where you family's future is concerned, avoid the tips, and stick with a disciplined and diversified approach.</p><p> Code Red? Yes.</p><p> <strong>  5. Change lanes &mdash; every year </strong></p><p> Smart investors watch the market and frequently move money into the latest high performing investment, right?</p><p> Early in my career I worked for a company that offered a Science and Technology mutual fund. In 1998 it achieved returns in excess of 90%. One of my clients wanted to move all their money into this fund. They could not understand my reluctance. As a matter of fact they treated me with disdain, as if I was a fool for not encouraging them to pursue 90% returns. I asked them to sign a disclosure form if they wished to proceed.</p>I had a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu experience in 2005. Nearly every person that came in to see me wanted to put money into real estate. I would tell them, \"Each time you say the word 'real estate' I want you to replace it with the word 'technology' and tell me if it still sounds like a good idea.\"<p> In 2011, gold became the investment fad of choice. Once again, everyone that came to see began asking about gold &mdash; just about the time it reached its peak price.</p><p> You've probably noticed if you constantly changes lanes on a backed up highway, always trying to inch ahead, you usually end up farther behind. Driving this way isn't effective; investing this way isn't effective either. Pick a disciplined strategy and stick to it. Jumping from investment to investment is only going to slow you down.</p><p> Code Red? Yes.</p><p> <strong>  6. Play the currency cards </strong></p><p> Experts can deliver higher returns, right? Find someone who knows how to trade, and you'll be set.</p><p> In 2007 once of my clients came to meet with me about a month before his retirement date. He told me he wasn't going to need to withdraw his monthly retirement income from his IRA as he had planned.</p><p> \"Why?\" I asked, intrigued.</p><p> He said he'd invested $100,000 in a currency trading program that was paying him $5,000 a month. He showed me the checks he was receiving. I got a sick feeling in my stomach. The math didn't add up. At $5,000 a month, that's $60,000 a year, on a $100,000 investment. No one can deliver returns that high. How do you explain this to someone who has checks in their hand?</p><p> Within six months this currency trading program was discovered to be a scam and the perpetrators were arrested. I wasn't surprised.</p><p> If experts could generate such high returns, why would they need your business? Don't play the currency cards, the expert cards, or fall for any kind of outlandish promises. I've yet to see one of these programs work the way it was marketed.</p><p> Code Red? Yes.</p><p> <strong>  7. Follow your ego </strong></p><p> Better investments are available to those with more money, right? If you get the opportunity to participate in something exclusive, it is likely to deliver better returns.</p><p> One of the most effective investment sales pitches I've seen is the one that appeals to your ego. In 2006 one of my clients left my firm and moved her $4 million to a firm across town. They told her at her account size, she should be participating in exclusive investment opportunities available only to accredited investors. She invested all her money in three exclusive investments they offered &mdash; and lost it all.</p><p> The recommendations made to her were grossly inappropriate. She was a widow with four daughters under the age of 21. But the firm she moved to was of the same religion as she, and told her they could handle everything &mdash; all her accounting, legal work and investing &mdash; so she trusted them. The regulators are investigating, which is good, but they won't be able to get her money back.</p><p> If someone appeals to your ego, walk away. When it comes to investing, the only thing I've seen egos do is help someone lose money.</p><p> Code Red? Yes.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  8. Follow their ego </strong></p><p> You can trust prestigious people in your community. That's why you should do business with them, right?</p><p> Checks and balances are good in government and in investing. One way to make sure checks and balances are in place is to work with an investment adviser that uses a third party custodian. The third party custodian sends account statements directly to you. The investment adviser can make changes in your account, but the transactions are reported to you directly by the custodian, who isn't and should not be affiliated with the investment adviser. </p><p> In fraud cases like the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investing-lessons-from-ponzi-and-madoff-2013-06-17\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bernie Madoff  </a> </u>  situation, his firm served as its own custodian which meant they could make up what their clients would see on their statements. Not good.  <br/> <br/> If there are no checks and balances in place, don't take the risk. It isn't worth your life savings.</p><p> Code Red? Yes.</p><p> <strong>  9. Leverage up </strong></p><p> Borrowing at low interest rates and investing in high growth assets is an excellent way to accumulate wealth, isn't it?</p><p> About 10 years ago one of my clients shared his plan to build a $5 million home on a lot he owned on the coast in California. To complete the project he would need a construction loan, the use of most of his liquid assets, and a loan against a portfolio he held at another financial institution. I projected the potential results and said, \"This only works if everything goes right.\" Nevertheless, he felt confident and moved forward.</p><p> Soon after the home was completed, his employment contract was abruptly terminated. About that time the real estate market and stock market both tanked. Since he had a loan against a portfolio of stocks he received a margin call (which means you must deposit funds). As things stand today his assets are gone and he must rebuild from scratch.</p><p> Think twice before borrowing to invest. It causes ruin more often than it causes riches.</p><p> Code Red? Yes.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  10. Mistaken motives </strong></p><p> People marketing investments and financial advice are highly regulated and must give you advice that is in your best interest, right?</p><p> About five years ago some friends of mine asked to meet with me to potentially hire me as their financial adviser. They also met with another adviser they knew. I explained to them that I was a fee-only adviser which meant I could not be compensated by commissions in any way and that I had a fiduciary duty to give them advice that was in their best interest. I took the time to explain how index funds work and ran a projection for them using what I deemed to be realistic returns in the 6%-7% range. They hired the other adviser.</p><p> Three months later I received a panicked call from them. They told me their adviser they needed about $150,000 to remain liquid as they were shopping for a new home. However, he had invested their entire portfolio &mdash; over $1 million &mdash; in illiquid investments; two annuities and one privately traded REIT (real-estate investment trust). All were products that paid large commissions to the adviser who sold them. I asked for all their documentation and was able to get them out of the annuities on a technicality.</p><p> After solving their problem, I asked them why they hired the other person. They said it was because he said 12% returns were realistic, while I said to expect only 6%-7%. They remain my clients today.</p><p> Although you can't learn the entire investment industry, you can always ask for details about compensation. Follow the money and it will tell you a lot about the motive. Commission products have appropriate uses and there are some great advisers who are compensated via commissions &mdash; but if someone is putting your entire life savings in illiquid high-commissioned products, you ought to be looking for a new adviser.</p><p> Code Red? No, but someone with mistaken motives can still cost you a lot of time and money.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 16:07:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 16:07:34.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_JSz9J8i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-ways-to-wipe-out-your-retirement-savings/\", \"post_id\": \"5899\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 16:07:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 16:07:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-ways-to-wipe-out-your-retirement-savings\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5898\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2691\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fisher_Island_Photos_3.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1011\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441363500,"author_id":125,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s your life savings, your retirement, your kids&rsquo; college tuition, their inheritance. It&rsquo;s important and you worry about it, and that&rsquo;s completely natural. But letting those emotions taint your influencing strategy can be counterproductive. Emotional investing won&rsquo;t get you where you want to go.  Discipline and a systematic investment process will.</p><p> <strong>  The Media wants to make money </strong></p><p> A lot of the blame for emotional investing can be placed at the feet of the financial media. Don&rsquo;t be fooled, their primary goal is not your financial success, it&rsquo;s selling advertising. They sell advertising by getting viewers, and they get viewers with sensational headlines. The easiest way to do that is to make you worry that you are doing something wrong, and make you think that they can help.</p><p> Believe it or not, stress and fear do not lead to a good investment experience.  Listening to the financial media leads to you whipsawing your portfolio all over the place. One month, gold is the hot sector that you need to be in, the next it&rsquo;s emerging markets, and the next THE MARKET IS GOING TO CRASH SO SELL EVERYTHING AND BUY BONDS. The truth is they have no idea what is going to happen. No one does.</p><p> <strong>  Investing is like Farming </strong></p><p> Think of investing like farming. At the beginning of the season you don&rsquo;t know which cornstalk is going to be the tallest, so you plant as much as you can and harvest everything. You don&rsquo;t know what stock or what sector is going to perform best this year, so you diversify across everything and harvest the market returns.  Some years you&rsquo;ll be up, and some years you&rsquo;ll be down, but if you stay the course, you&rsquo;ll have a good investment experience.</p><p> <strong>  Fear vs Greed </strong></p><p> Most investors operate on two emotions: fear and greed. They&rsquo;re afraid of losing money and they want to make as much money as possible, so they buy when things seem great and the market is going up, and sells when things seem bad and the market is going down. In other words,  most investors buy high and sell low. This is a really great way to lose money.</p><p> <strong>  Most Investors are Bad at Investing </strong></p><p> You can see this if you look at how mutual fund investors actually perform over time.  The average mutual fund investor has done a really bad job of simply capturing market returns, let alone beating the market.   <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/05/09/just-how-dumb-are-investors/\" target=\"_blank\">   Dalbar studies the investment returns of mutual fund investors through time  </a> </u> , and they really bring this home.</p><img alt=\"Investing and Emotions\" src=\"http://43jfx2296bul1wvuiw3tu1z2.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/chart.jpg\"/><p>  </p><p> <strong>  Annualized Returns 1984-2013 </strong></p><p> The average equity mutual fund investor from 1984 &ndash; 2013 has an annualized return of 3.70% per year. Over the same period, 1984 &ndash; 2013, the S&amp;P 500 Index had an annualized return of 11.18%. Also worth pointing, out, over the same period the one month US Treasury Bill, which most people think of as a risk free investment, had an annualized return of 3.87%. In short,  the average mutual fund investor would have been better off just going to the beach and staying out of the market.</p><p> The problem is not the market. Investors could have easily captured those market returns &ndash; the S&amp;P 500 Index had an annualized return of over 11% during that period, and index funds are cheap. The problem is the average mutual fund investor invests with their heart, not their brains. They&rsquo;re either trying to outguess the market or have fallen prey to the financial media.  Simply being disciplined and staying the course would have resulted in a very different investment experience.</p><p> <strong>  Quick! Do Nothing! </strong></p><p> If you base investment decisions on the cover of a magazine, you&rsquo;re too late. All of the available information is already priced into the market. The movements of the stock market are based on new information, and prices move incredibly fast. This isn&rsquo;t to say that the market is always right. They&rsquo;re not. In fact, I would argue that the market probably misprices every single security out there. The problem is, we have no way of knowing if a security is under or over priced.</p><p> To deal with this, you need to follow a systematic investment process.  Look at what you are trying to achieve with your money, and how much risk you are comfortable taking, and then set an asset allocation. Then stick to it.</p><p> Asset allocation is your best defense against emotional investing. Set your asset allocation up to achieve your goals while taking the least risk possible. Set yourself up for fewer sleepless nights, less emotional investing, and, ultimately, a better investment experience.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 16:21:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 16:21:51.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_7nqUS8V.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/keeping-emotions-and-investing-separate/\", \"post_id\": \"5901\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 16:21:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 16:21:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"keeping-emotions-and-investing-separate\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5900\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2692\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441071976244-9d5b90825a80-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"253\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441378800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2628,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Help Owners Transfer their Businesses to Insiders--Successfully","link":"how-to-help-owners-transfer-their-businesses-to-insiders-successfully","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Brownie was a typical hard-working owner.  When the time came for him to retire, he realized that his only son had no taste for the food business.  That left one possible buyer:  Bill, his key employee of twenty years.  So Brownie asked his attorney to \"draw up the papers.\"  Bill bought the business for a small down payment and a large promissory note.</p><p> Bill made a few payments, fell behind, promised to catch up, and then stopped paying.  By the time Brownie got his company back, there was little left to take back.</p><p> Exit stories don't have to end this way.  The transfer to insider process (a sale to key employees or children) that we use has three guiding principles:</p><li> Maintain owner control</li><li> Minimize owner risk</li><li> Maximize owner's receipt of value <br/>  </li><p> The owner maintains  control  of the business until he or she receives maximum value, defined as the cash needed or desired for financial independence.  In maintaining control, we minimize the risk to the owner (of not achieving financial independence) and to the business (of failing to succeed).</p><p> Many owners often don't even consider transferring a business to their key employees because employees rarely have money and/or can't run the business.  Instead, they look at selling to an outside party (who has cash) as the only practical exit path.  They assume that any other path is too risky.</p><p> Others think of transferring to insiders as the exit path of last resort.  Only when they learn that their companies aren't valuable enough or aren't attractive to third parties or that their kids don't want the business, do they default to, \"I guess I'll sell to my key employees.\"</p><p> When owners pick a transfer to insiders as their default option, the transfer usually fails because the business lacks essential value drivers; it has little transferable value.  It has little transferable value because the owner is still indispensable to the business.  Even if key employees had capital, they can't run the business without the owner. (See:   <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/grow-value-and-exit-successfully-owners-need-change-their-role\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   To Grow Value and Exit Successfully Owners Need to Change Their Role  </a> </u> )</p><p> The typical (and doomed to fail) transfer to insider plan design mirrors Brownie's:  a long-term note with little money down.  The buyers default because the business doesn't produce enough cash flow to support both operating expenses and a note payment.</p><p> Our experience and the experience of BEI Members is the polar opposite of the typical inside sale scenario.   <strong>  We find that the transfer to insiders is the exit path most traveled, successfully, by business owners today. </strong></p><p> So what do these owners and their advisors know about designing a successful transfer that you don't?  Let's meet Francis, an owner that we will use, in the next several articles, to illustrate the benefits and challenges of this type of transfer, as well as the elements of a successful design plan.</p><p> Francis:</p><p> Desired Exit Date:  Six to seven years from today <br/> Desired Successor:  His three key employees <br/> Needed from the Sale of Business for Financial Independence:  $2.5M (after tax) <br/> Current Value of Business:  $1,000,000 (pre-tax) <br/> Business Value Necessary to Net $2.5M:  $3,300,000 (pre-tax)</p><p> When Francis first met with his Exit-Planning advisor, they started working to increase the transferable value of the company by creating an incentive for the key employee group (KEG) to grow the cash flow of the company.  If the company attained specific cash flow growth each year, members of the KEG were rewarded with the opportunity to acquire ownership.</p><p> The transfer plan design provided the KEG with the ability to acquire the company, and Francis knew, based on the plan design, that if the KEG reached their performance goals to acquire ownership, he would realize his exit goals.</p><p> During the seven-year buy-out period, Francis's after-tax proceeds totaled $2.5 million, he maintained full control of the company and continued to draw his full salary, even though he worked fewer and fewer hours.  With less time devoted to the business, Francis was able to explore activities he thought he might pursue after he sold the business.</p><p> How did Francis do it?  That's the topic we begin to tackle in next week's article.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 16:34:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 16:34:53.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_81rEEPu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-help-owners-transfer-their-businesses-to-insiders-successfully/\", \"post_id\": \"5903\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 16:34:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 16:34:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-help-owners-transfer-their-businesses-to-insiders-successfully\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5902\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2693\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1440796971131-c1796c8c4493.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"449\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441367100,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2629,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Ways To Toot Your Own Horn At Work","link":"10-ways-to-toot-your-own-horn-at-work","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A vice president recently told me that when he acknowledges his employees&rsquo; accomplishments, many of them belittle their success with such comments as  &ldquo;Oh, that was no big deal&rdquo;  or  &ldquo;What a fluke.&rdquo;   <br/> <br/> Many business professionals negate compliments, often because they don&rsquo;t want to be perceived as braggarts or as suffering from too big an ego.  <br/> <br/> Bragging is obnoxious boasting, and is usually done by people who want to let you know how great they think they are. This includes the technique known as &ldquo;humblebrag&rdquo; &ndash; its practitioners still brag, but try to disguise it as being humble or mildly self-deprecating. This is usually achieved by admitting to a minor flaw while really drawing attention to the big-brag item. (My favorite example: &ldquo;I am such a klutz. I just spilled wine on my new book contract.&rdquo;) <br/> <br/> Bragging of any kind is not the way to impress colleagues, or bosses. However, I do believe that tactful and appropriate self-promotion is a business skill. Learning when and how to speak well of yourself is a key to getting and staying ahead.  <br/> <br/> Listed below are 10 ways to toot your own horn, including accepting compliments, without being insufferable: <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Accept compliments.  </strong> When I complimented a vice president on his handwriting, he responded, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my pen!&rdquo;  When you negate a compliment (like the employees mentioned in the opening paragraph), you are putting yourself down. Instead, simply say &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thank you, I appreciate that&rdquo; &ndash; and then shut your mouth. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Be visible.  </strong> Get involved. Join organizations and volunteer for their committees. Participate in office activities. Volunteer to make presentations. If possible, write articles for your company&rsquo;s publications. You need to make yourself known. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Be prepared. </strong>  You may find yourself in situations where you have to tell others about yourself, such as when you are a new member of a group, or during a meeting when everyone in the room introduces him- or herself. Prepare such a self-introduction, and practice delivering it, so that you will be comfortable speaking about yourself. Keep it simple but positive, such as: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tom Smith, the new director in sales. John Jones brought me in to start the new field service project. I&rsquo;m very excited about that, and expect it will take up a lot of my time for a while. But in my spare time, I enjoy being a Big Brother to my little buddy, Freddie.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. When asked, do tell. </strong>   Someone asks you &ldquo;How are things at work?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;Fine, thanks,&rdquo; and move on. This is your opportunity to mention your accomplishments &ndash; and express genuine pleasure when you do. When I was asked that question recently, I responded, &ldquo;I have great news. I was just interviewed by a national business magazine!&rdquo; <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Do not use superlatives about your own activities, unless, like Muhammad Ali, you can justify saying &ldquo;I am the greatest!&rdquo; </strong>  Simply describe what you did, such as, &ldquo;Using the new numbers from our field offices, I was able to cut our costs by a quarter.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Use comparisons. </strong>  I once coached a manager on how to use her experience preparing for the Boston Marathon as a way to answer questions about how she would prepare for a company&rsquo;s market expansion. The comparisons were legitimate and helpful to her audience &ndash; and, of course, the higher-ups were quite impressed by the fact that she ran a marathon.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  7. Enter competitions and apply for awards. </strong>  Winning awards is a way for people who know you, but especially those who don&rsquo;t know you, to find out about your talents. It builds your credibility.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  8. Weave your accomplishments into conversation, when appropriate.  </strong> I sometimes use my experiences to illustrate key teaching points in my classes, and by doing so I highlight my accomplishments. For example, when discussing how important it is to prepare for an overseas assignment, I will mention how I prepared for my trip before I spoke at a ground-breaking women&rsquo;s seminar in Kuwait.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  9. Post your accomplishments on your social media sites. </strong>  However, be careful not to mention the same accomplishment over and over.  You can overdo it, and this will make you sound like a braggart. Remember, there is a balance: You also must speak of other things, not just about what you do well.    <br/> <br/> <strong>  10. Speak well of others, too. </strong>  This is a gracious thing to do, and is usually appreciated by the other people involved. Plus, when you praise others&rsquo; achievements, your comments about yourself won&rsquo;t seem out of place.  (But don&rsquo;t praise someone if it isn&rsquo;t warranted. Others will know, and you will appear phony.)</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 16:39:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 16:39:30.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_eSjPPkL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-ways-to-toot-your-own-horn-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"5905\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 16:39:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 16:39:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-ways-to-toot-your-own-horn-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5904\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2694\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5830411257_b21bf9e931_b.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"730\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441393200,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}

You might be killing your brand if&hellip;</p><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t bother to figure out what you stand for in the first place. </strong> <br/> Everything hinges on the underlying reason why you do what you do. If you don&rsquo;t have that clearly defined, if your core values aren&rsquo;t clearly articulated, then you&rsquo;re always going to be falling short with your clients, your customers, and your employees.</li><li> <strong>  You use cheap designers. </strong> <br/> Yes, hiring your neighbor&rsquo;s third cousin&rsquo;s nephew who is currently in design school will save money. At first. Until you have to hire a real professional to fix the mess. And then you&rsquo;ll end up spending more than if you&rsquo;d used a pro in the first place. In addition, cheap design typically looks cheap. Which means your customers think your product or service is just as cheap as your image. Self-destructive cycle, really.</li><li> <strong>  You think your logo and sign is enough. </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s not. Logos, business cards, letterhead, signs &mdash; they&rsquo;re all pieces of your brand. But they are NOT your brand. Your brand is the overall human experience. Your brand is your values in action. Your brand is so. much. bigger. than just your design.</li><li> <strong>  You don&rsquo;t use social media. </strong> <br/> A business that is not online in today&rsquo;s world, simply doesn&rsquo;t exist. End of story. Anyone who tells you otherwise is living under a rock.</li><li> <strong>  You use social media inconsistently. </strong> <br/> Unlike the good old days when you could put up an advertising poster somewhere and then forget to go back and take it down without any harm to your business, inconsistent social media will actually backfire on your brand. As bad as it is to be invisible online, it&rsquo;s worse to look like you don&rsquo;t care enough to stay up to date.</li><li> <strong>  You won&rsquo;t listen to people who are professionals in areas where you aren&rsquo;t an expert. </strong> <br/> Shut up and listen. When it&rsquo;s outside your area of expertise, stop being a control freak and trust the people you&rsquo;ve hired who know what they&rsquo;re doing. If you won&rsquo;t get out of the way and let them do their jobs, you&rsquo;re wasting your money and their time.</li><li> <strong>  You focus more on product than relationships. </strong> <br/> So your product is good? That&rsquo;s nice. Your relationships should be even better. If you&rsquo;re a jerk to work with, people will find somebody else, even if you have the best quality in town.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-03 16:51:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-03 16:51:19.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_U9AqDHl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-dumbest-ways-to-kill-your-brand/\", \"post_id\": \"5907\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-03 16:51:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-03 16:51:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-dumbest-ways-to-kill-your-brand\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5906\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2695\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441128754183-d2d4d36fb622-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"586\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441382400,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}

I still do. </strong> I can ask him anything about anything &ndash; the distance from earth to the sun, the way Vercingetorix valiantly fought Julius Caesar during the Gallic Wars, why tomatoes are red and cucumbers green, why I like chocolate but not spinach, how to translate the word &ldquo;serendipity&rdquo; in French, who originally wrote Antigone, and why birds are not getting electrocuted when they sit on power lines.</p><p> If any of those questions intrigued you, it&rsquo;s very unlikely you&rsquo;ll ask a friend. Instead, you&rsquo;ll say you have it on the tip of your tongue, then you&rsquo;ll probably pull your mobile phone and ask Google or Wikipedia. In the process, you&rsquo;ll have just missed an opportunity to make your brain work and train your memory. It&rsquo;s interesting to notice we avoid pushing ourselves too much to remember things, even though it would be the most natural training for our brains, but instead  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/04/can-i-increase-my-brain-power\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  purchase apps and  <u>   video games such as Dr. Kawashima&rsquo;s Brain Training  </u> </a>  to get smarter &ndash; or maybe just to avoid a total deliquescence without cutting too much on our tech time.</p><p> Maybe it started with the pocket calculator. Some say it all started with the GPS. Most people can&rsquo;t go places without it anymore. Then there was music, with iTunes managing our entire library, and people starting to listen to one song or another from an artist they didn&rsquo;t know much about, based on the algorithmic recommendation of the software. Long gone were the days of building a collection of CDs and remembering all the details about each album and members of a band. David Brooks, who is pretty conservative, calls it the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/26/opinion/26brooks.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   externalisation of the musical taste  </a> </u> . Sounds like we are basically outsourcing our brains to the cloud.</p><p> And personal assistants such as Siri, Google Now and Cortana are making it easier and easier to not use our brains too much. Our smartphones are smart, so we don&rsquo;t need to be.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/magazine/the-twitter-trap.html?_r=3&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">   Some even worry it might impact the cognitive advance of our species in a negative way  </a>  . </u></p><h3> I respectfully disagree.</h3><p> <br/> All those applications are freeing up precious energy and time so we can focus on what matters most in our lives. In the same way mechanisation has been freeing people up from physical and low-skilled jobs in some countries, giving them more time to spend on education, personal relationships, and their hobbies, I believe that &lsquo;outsourcing&rsquo; technologies give us more opportunities to be creative and imaginative, to fulfil our lives, and to be happier overall.</p><p> Rote memorisation and calculus, while both impressive skills that I respect, are not the most valuable type of &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; human beings are capable of, and certainly not, in my humble opinion, the best use we can make of the complex computers are brains are. We&rsquo;ve been outsourcing lots of the data processing to computers for years now, and it has allowed us to to focus on the creative thinking, the bold concepts, the crazy tests and trials, the out-of-the-box ideas only a fluid, non pre-programmed brain like the ones we have are able to come up with.</p><p> Of course, there&rsquo;s the whole debate about strong AI, and how robots might take over the world one day if we let them become too intelligent. Even Stephen Hawking, one the persons I admire the most, warns that  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &ldquo;The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  Maybe. Maybe not. But we&rsquo;re still so, so far from having to ask ourselves that question, and there&rsquo;s still so much to discover and to improve that it would be a shame to stay paralysed for fear of what might or might not happen in several hundreds of years.</p><p> The future is in our hands, and if we cannot control all the outcomes of the current research and development we&rsquo;re working on at the moment, we can definitely impact the direction humanity is taking. In my opinion, a future where people have infinite access to super-relevant and customised information, can solve complex equations in seconds, know exactly who&rsquo;s the right person to ask a question to and how to contact them, and can build on the work of our generation, supported by the processing power of intelligent computers, is an interesting direction.</p><p> <strong>  And this is where we seem to be going, so better make the most out of it. </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-05 18:45:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-05 18:45:08.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_jgqDX4Z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-if-we-are-outsourcing-our-brains-to-the-cloud/\", \"post_id\": \"5913\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-05 18:45:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-05 18:45:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-if-we-are-outsourcing-our-brains-to-the-cloud\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5912\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2699\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-05-at-11.44.43-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"594\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441732500,"author_id":40,"chart_url":""}

Not operational efficiency or some pricey back-end technology that will revolutionize how you track and expand client relationships? Those may not make you the best possible leader for your business.</p><p> Imagination and a healthy sense of confidence will help you make it happen.</p><p> Charles Schwab, the founder of The Charles Schwab Corp., said, &ldquo;A man to carry on a successful business must have imagination. He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole thing.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Imagination. Vision. Dreams. </strong> Sounds more like a Pixar movie than the financial industry, but stick with me. Though the financial services industry doesn't have the reputation of being a particularly creative one, it's no excuse for not being an exception to the rule. Ignoring the value of creativity and imagination is a bad strategic move.</p><h3> Intentionally Different</h3><p> <br/> Imagination fuels creativity that's useful in many areas beyond ad copy or website design. It could be the catalyst for an ingenious system for reaching a new, tech-savvy generation of clients. Or for an investing strategy that achieves higher alpha with lower risk. Just because something hasn't been done before doesn't mean it can't be successful. Cue the clich&eacute;d adage: There's a first time for everything. So why not now? Why not your firm?</p><p> Firms that stand out are not only better &mdash; they're intentionally different.</p><p> The usual response has something to do with: &ldquo;That's just not how it's done.&rdquo; So what? There is this &ldquo;rule book&rdquo; associated with success in financial services that has nothing to do with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. It's the one that says using navy blue, Greek columns, handshakes and the exact same mission statement as every other firm in the business is the best way to show you are a leader in the industry and worthy of trust.</p><p> That just isn't true anymore. Sticking to that formula is just going through the motions. It will get your firm only so far, and that won't be anywhere close to extraordinary.</p><h3> Breaking the rules is different than breaking the law.</h3><p> <br/> It's not that the rule book needs to be thrown out altogether, but we need to adopt a more critical viewpoint on what factors are critical to success in financial services (trust, service and delivering solid results for your clients) and the areas that could stand a shot of imagination (branding, websites, operations, relationship building and communications).</p><p> I'm certainly not advocating that you break the law &mdash; but if you break some &ldquo;that's just how it's done&rdquo; rules to serve your clients better, then good for you.</p><p> There's no time to waste wondering whether to investigate if your firm is simply going through the motions. You can start with an assessment of your marketing efforts.</p><p> If the content is vague, eerily similar to your firm's nearest competitors or outright uninspiring &mdash; it's likely a symptom of bigger issues at the brand level. If those issues exist, there is absolutely no way they can be solved without creative thinking.</p><p> So you might as well go ahead and give yourself permission to use your imagination right now. <strong>  But that's only if you really want to be great &mdash; firms that want to be merely good need not apply. </strong></p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-05 18:54:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-05 18:54:48.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_NBAqTwp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/imagination-breaking-the-rules-is-different-than-breaking-the-law/\", \"post_id\": \"5915\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-05 18:54:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-05 18:54:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"imagination-breaking-the-rules-is-different-than-breaking-the-law\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5914\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2700\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-05-at-12.16.05-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"561\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441724400,"author_id":146,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2635,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Value of Life Insurance","link":"the-value-of-life-insurance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The stage in life when most adults have the most need for life insurance is when they are parents and their children are young. Unfortunately, this is often a time when financial resources are already stretched. Unlike health insurance and house payments, life insurance can easily be regarded as optional rather than a priority.</p><p> To fully appreciate the value of life insurance, it may help to think of it in a different way. Its major function for young parents is as \"income insurance.\" At this stage of life, it is not an investment. Like homeowners and auto insurance, it is an expense for essential coverage that you hope never to have to use. Its purpose is to provide for the family, if one parent should die, by replacing that person's paycheck.</p><h3> How much life insurance is necessary?</h3><p> <br/> The short answer is \"as much as you can reasonably afford, and more than you probably think you need.\"</p><p> I recommend that parents of young children have a minimum of $500,000 to $1,000,000. Coverage for a stay-at-home parent is just as important as it is for a primary breadwinner. This may seem ridiculously high until you start looking at how much it costs to raise a child as a single parent. Just the basic costs of food, housing, health insurance, and daycare can be daunting. If you add in expenses like sports, music lessons, orthodontia, or college tuition, $500,000 doesn't seem like such a huge sum.</p><p> What makes this level of coverage affordable for young parents is term life insurance. Term insurance, as its name implies, is a policy taken out for a specific length of time, commonly 10 to 20 to 30 years. It pays the beneficiary the face amount upon the death of the insured, with no investment component or accumulated cash value. Because it is insurance only, it offers the most income replacement for the lowest cost. <br/> <br/> If you are in good health, term insurance is relatively inexpensive. For a 33-year-old non-smoker, for example, a $500,000 policy would cost a woman around $30 a month for a 20-year term or around $45 a month for a 30-year term. A man would pay around $36 a month for 20 years or $60 a month for 30 years. The longer the term of the policy, the higher the premium. <br/> <br/> If you're in your 30's, the ending date of a 20-year term life insurance policy may seem far into the future. Once a policy is in place, it's easy to disregard it except as one more regular expense. It can be a rude awakening, then, to reach your mid-50's and get a notice from the insurance company that your policy is expiring.</p><p> The biggest risk with such a situation is that you aren't able to renew the policy because you have become uninsurable. To minimize this risk, it's wise to purchase the longest term policy that you can afford. It's also a good idea to review your life insurance needs every few years so you can make timely decisions about whether you need to renew or extend your term insurance.</p><p> It's helpful, as well, to be clear about the purpose served by term insurance. In most cases, the focus is to provide for minor children, not to provide income for a spouse after the children are grown.</p><p> Ideally, by this stage in life, a widowed spouse will not need a large life insurance policy to produce income. Instead, with the money the couple has saved through buying low-cost term insurance, they have been able to fully fund their retirement plans.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-05 21:36:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-05 21:36:39.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_g0fbRe6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-value-of-life-insurance/\", \"post_id\": \"5917\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-05 21:36:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-05 21:36:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-value-of-life-insurance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5916\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2701\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-05-at-2.39.33-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"800\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441728000,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Why else would a business offer something for free?</p><p> Many professionals still use &ldquo;free&rdquo; fairly freely in their marketing though: FREE initial consultation&hellip;.FREE report&hellip;.FREE advice&hellip;.and for some odd reason find that they don&rsquo;t attract their ideal clients.  They do attract some prospects and turn them into clients, however they set themselves up for an ongoing business relationship where price is a battleground.</p><p> Objective professional advice comes at a cost. Impartiality especially comes at a cost as it means avoiding the hidden incentives, or &ldquo;soft dollars&rdquo;, and avoiding or transparently revealing any potentially conflicted remuneration sources.  Impartial advice is never free&hellip;.and impartial advice is pretty much all discerning consumers want initially.  So offering that for &ldquo;free&rdquo; actually creates distrust on the consumers part.  They know someone has to be paying for it, and that someone is either an unseen entity in the background (so what is really being provided here?), or it is themselves paying for it in a way that is being withheld from them.</p><p> So nobody out there in the world who is likely to be a good advice client actually believes that your advice can be impartial AND free.  It is one or the other perhaps, but certainly not both.</p><h3> Why don&rsquo;t we just tell it as it is?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  It is at our cost. </strong></p><p> That initial consultation, or the useful report provided with our compliments, is delivered at our cost.  We are running a business and the business certainly wants and needs to make a profit for its owners.  Everyone expects that, so why hide it?  In fact, be business-like about it and let prospective customers know that a significant part of our marketing budget is delivering time and resources directly to potential customers in the form of no obligation initial meetings or resources so they can &ldquo;try before they buy&rdquo;.  We do it because it directs the marketing budget to those who are truly interested, rather than wasting it on (say) radio or print advertising to thousands of disinterested consumers.</p><p> We deliver the &ldquo;try before you buy&rdquo; experiences at our cost, as part of our marketing expense, to those most likely to benefit from the expertise we can provide and who are more likely then to provide a return for the business.  It just makes good commercial sense for everyone involved.</p><p> Position your expertise and offer appropriately, and remove one of the big barriers to engagement by eliminating the unasked questions in discerning consumers minds.  What we do is not free, it is just something that we are willing to do sometimes and in fairly small doses at our own expense in order to give people a chance to decide on whether it is right for them.</p><p> <strong>  Why not tell your target market that? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-07 14:15:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-07 14:15:21.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_SyJH89d.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/nobody-believes-your-advice-can-be-impartial-and-free/\", \"post_id\": \"5919\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-07 14:15:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-07 14:15:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"nobody-believes-your-advice-can-be-impartial-and-free\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5918\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2702\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-07-at-7.16.16-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"586\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441711800,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

No flip-flops anytime, sorry.</h3><p> <br/> The policy&mdash;which is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2015/08/07/exp-qmb-barclays-dress-code.cnn\" target=\"_blank\">   not unusual in banking  </a> </u> &mdash;particularly targeted the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/barclays-memo-mcfarlane-bans-flip-flops-and-jeans-from-its-head-office-10445368.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   staff of the Barclaycard division  </a> </u> , &ldquo;because of their looser dress code, in line with other tech startups rather than suited bankers,&rdquo; writes theIndependent.</p><p> At HP, some R&amp;D teams within the group&rsquo;s Enterprise Services division, which employs 100,000 people worldwide, were reportedly sent a confidential memo earlier this summer, according to the Register UK. &ldquo;The dress code memo was sent out because higher-ups believe customers visiting HP&rsquo;s offices will be put off by scruffy-looking R&amp;D engineers, we&rsquo;re told,&rdquo; writes Chris Williams.</p><p> What should the sartorial sysadmin wear, according to the purported memo? &ldquo;Men should avoid turning up to the office in T-shirts with no collars, faded or torn jeans, shorts, baseball caps and other headwear, sportswear, and sandals and other open shoes,&rdquo; Williams writes. &ldquo;Women are advised not to wear short skirts, faded or torn jeans, low-cut dresses, sandals, crazy high heels, and too much jewelry.&rdquo;</p><p> Not surprisingly, memos like these get some IT types hot under the collar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather have a bunch of sloppy dressing highly creative people who are good at solving difficult problems than a bunch of uniform dressing people incapable of actually solving anything,&rdquo; commented one.  &ldquo;The most creative, successful tech people never, ever conform to how society or your narrow minded-ness thinks they should behave/dress/live. Accommodating those eccentric people is a competitive edge for a lot of businesses (like banks, startups &amp; fast growing tech companies, even the government).&rdquo;</p><p> IT people also pointed out that suits were impractical on days when they were crawling around on the floor (or under it) stringing cable, and that ties could be downright hazardous around equipment such as printers.</p><p> Needless to say, the majority of commenters agreed that dressing in a more businesslike fashion is appropriate for customer-facing employees. It was everyone having to dress up, in case a customer happened to come by, that disturbed people.</p><p> Though even that sentiment could have a backlash. &ldquo;If I were a visitor being shown around a company, seeing a development office full of suits would give me the impression that they are subject to a regime of office politics which will constantly interfere with their productivity,&rdquo; remarked one commenter.</p><p> Not to mention, the issue struck some as strange in a day and age when companies are debating whether employees need to come into the office at all, especially when  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/07/30/news-flash-hp-says-it-has-no-dress-code/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   competition for skilled staff  </a> </u>  is so strong.</p><p> &ldquo;Companies seeking the best and brightest engineers and programmers need to be loose in the wardrobe department,&rdquo; writes Barb Darrow in Fortune. &ldquo;No one can imagine Google or Facebook demanding &lsquo;smart casual&rsquo; gear, for example.&rdquo;</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3018572/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/do-dress-codes-at-the-office-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Certainly not Google  </a> </u> , writes Lydia Dishman in Fast Company. &ldquo;The search giant&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/tech/2013/02/50-things-you-didnt-know-about-google/dress-code\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  l  <u>   ack of a formal dress code  </u> </a>  means employees&rsquo; clothing choices run the gamut of buttoned-up button-downs accessorized with pearl earrings to jeans and T-shirts,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;But that hasn&rsquo;t hurt productivity. In fact, while some staff liken its Garage innovation space to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3017824/work-smart/how-googles-flexible-workspace-ignites-creative-collaboration-on-wheels?\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cross between kindergarten and a classy law firm  </a> </u> , Google is consistently ranked as one of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/best-companies/2013/snapshots/1.html?iid=bc_sp_list\" target=\"_blank\">   top best companies  </a> </u>  to work for.&rdquo;</p><p> Similarly, entrepreneur and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson  <u>  really hates ties </u> . He hates ties so much that he goes around with a  <u>  pair of scissors cutting them off </u>  of people.</p><p> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason  <u>  very few creative people wear suits and ties, </u> &rdquo; Branson writes. &ldquo;Audacious ideas rarely spring from boardrooms and office cubicles. They come from getting out and about and experiencing life in its most inspiring settings. Creativity doesn&rsquo;t wear a uniform, nor should creators.&rdquo;</p><p> Ironically, in 2013 Barclays&rsquo; dress code had also made headlines&mdash;this time because it was defying traditional banking and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/02/new-dress-code-horrifies-investment-bankers.html\" target=\"_blank\">   instituting &ldquo;supercasual Friday&rdquo; dress  </a> </u> . &ldquo;The idea, apparently, is to make Barclays a better, cooler place to work,&rdquo; John Carney wrote at the time for CNBC. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of a number of initiatives the company is taking to make employees enjoy their workplace more.&rdquo;</p><p> These days, many IT staff view a dress code as a proxy. &ldquo;As a software developer I would never again take a job with a dress code,&rdquo; wrote one commenter. &ldquo;I feel that it&rsquo;s a very good barometer of management style.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s unsurprising, then, that other companies such as Betabrand are using the kerfuffle as a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2015/tired-of-dress-codes-work-at-betabrand-wear-pretty-much-whatever-the-heck-you-want/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recruiting tool  </a> </u> , encouraging programmers to come work for them and wear anything they want. &ldquo;Betabrand also sent a list of acceptable office wear via an email release,&rdquo; writes Molly Brown in GeekWire. &ldquo;It includes fluorescent tank tops, mesh jerseys, Flashdance sweatshirts, muscle shirts, chicken suits and body paint. Only certain clown outfits are allowed, however. They have to draw a line somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p> HP executives, in fact, when the memo came to light, backpedaled as fast as their non-open-toed shoes could carry them, even  <u>  developing a video </u>  to promise that its IT staff could dress just as scruffy as the best of them.</p><p> Hopefully, the publicity surrounding these misguided efforts will give pause to the next CEO who wants to make a similar change. If not, look for ways to mitigate it. Can programmers keep a spare &ldquo;dress&rdquo; outfit around in case of an unexpected client visit? Or at least a long-sleeved button-down collared shirt to throw over the Black Sabbath T-shirt?</p><p> Alternatively, if the company wants to insist that sysadmins dress a certain way, is the company willing to help pay for cleaning if clothes are damaged in the course of work?</p><p> <strong>  And Branson is right: Lose the tie. </strong></p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-07 14:33:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-07 14:33:15.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_wYT29c6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/it-gives-dress-codes-a-dressing-down/\", \"post_id\": \"5921\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-07 14:33:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-07 14:33:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"it-gives-dress-codes-a-dressing-down\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5920\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2703\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-07-at-7.35.29-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1354\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441717200,"author_id":339,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2638,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Volatility Is Inevitable. Panic Isn't. How Good Planning Calms Nervous Clients","link":"volatility-is-inevitable-panic-isnt-how-good-planning-calms-nervous-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Anderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.seic.com/enUS/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI  </u> </a></p><p> This article originally appeared on SEI's Practically Speaking Blog</p><p> Last week, my family and I took a much needed, end-of-summer, before-the-start-of-school vacation to Colorado.  There was no cell service on the long hikes up the mountains and I certainly didn&rsquo;t  pull out my phone to check email when I was at 9,800 feet with 360&deg; views for 100 miles ( <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Head_Lookout\" target=\"_blank\">   Devil&rsquo;s head lookout  </a> </u> , check it out).  But, as Lloyd Bridges&rsquo; character said in the movie Airplane! &ldquo;Looks like I picked the wrong time to give up {insert your punch line here}.</p><p> Although I was busy taking in the views during the day, I still saw the news at night, including the pictures of Wall Street traders looking concerned, frazzled and exasperated.  Has anyone ever noticed how silly those pictures look in the headlines and websites during market downturns?</p><h3> What? No Panic?</h3><p> <br/> It seemed like every day last week (and most of this week) we saw hundreds of point swings in the equity markets.  Down 300, down 400, up 600, down again 400, and so on&mdash;the indexes looked like a super ball thrown from a tall building.  And while the markets were bouncing up and down (and maybe still are) the best news is that it seemed that almost every advisor that I talked to during this week said their clients were not panicking.  There were no huge sell orders or &ldquo;get me out of the market&rdquo; phone calls.</p><h3> Communication Prevents Anxiety</h3><p> <br/> Maybe I have a limited circle of advisor contacts but to me, the best advisors had already fully prepared their clients for an event like this. Many already have plans in place to communicate with their clients during such an event.</p><p> Advisors have talked to me over and over this week about the importance of communication&mdash;not when markets become volatile, but proactively, before any such events happen. They also told me about their &ldquo;contingency plans,&rdquo; put in place for exactly these times.</p><p> Below I have listed some of my favorite ideas from advisors (and have added a few of my own). These are good practices to help you with your nervous Nellies.</p><p> <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/09/150894-Plan-01.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"150894-Plan-01\" src=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/09/150894-Plan-01.jpg\"/> </a></p><h3> Start with Your Plan</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Prepare them for the inevitable: </strong>   If you have been in the business for more than a few weeks, you know that planning is the value hub of an advisor&rsquo;s business, but the markets still can affect the outcome. You also know that in the long term the markets go up, but in the short term they can go down. You know it, and so should your clients.  Repeat it. Repeat it often.  Prepare them for sudden, violent corrections.  As Nick Murray calls them, do a  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/client-service/staying-seaworthy-lifeboat-drills-help-prepare-clients-market-downturns/?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;life boat drill&rdquo; </a>  at every meeting.</p><p> <strong>  2. When the crisis du jour hits, do your homework:   </strong> Understand the issues at hand.  Read as much as possible.  Don&rsquo;t waste your time on the crackpot internet websites with conspiracy theory articles about the dollar being replaced as the standard currency or that we need to hoard ammunition and canned goods. Focus on market commentary from credible sources.  Look to your custodian, investment partners, broker dealer and specific money managers.  Be careful of confirmation bias&mdash;reading things that only confirm your already set opinion. Instead, be sure to educate yourself on what is going on from various perspectives. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Have a communication plan in place:   </strong> If you have  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/practice-efficiency/advisor-segmentation/is-your-client-segmentation-flat/?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  segmented your clients correctly </a> , you know who will need a little extra handholding. Think about creating a trigger communication plan. Maybe the trigger is a 200 point drop (or 600). Maybe it is based on a percentage of the market. Whatever it is, make sure you send out reassuring or &ldquo;thinking of you&rdquo; communications using their preferred method of communication, such as email, snail mail or phone calls (you should have captured that). Your nervous clients need a little extra attention to show them you are on top of things.</p><p> <strong>  4. Scour the news from your partners and use it: </strong>   A lot of advisors have added me to their client mailing lists, so I have seen many great commentaries and advisor insights during the last week. But to me, taking the time to create, get compliance approval, and publish commentary will only delay your most important job&mdash;calming your clients.  Leverage what is out there.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many of the communications that I received included an SEI commentary (As if I didn&rsquo;t read it already. OK, maybe I didn&rsquo;t. Thanks for sending).</p><h3> End with Their Plan</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  5. Review your goals-based planning and implementation:  </strong> Over the years I have written about  <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/client-service/one-risk-score-should-not-rule-them-all-goals-that-is/?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   goals-based planning  </a> </u>  and implementation, not because I know a lot about the planning side of our business, but because I understand the people side of our business.  Quite simply, this is how people think.</p><p> A single portfolio that is designed to incorporate a client&rsquo;s entire financial plan is impractical, because it forces the client to calculate the percentage of the portfolio needed for retirement, current income or stability.  Multiple portfolios using different risk tolerances and different asset implementation vehicles makes so much more sense to the client.  So take time to review the plan and progress to goals.</p><p> <strong>  6. Focus on their plan, not the markets.  </strong>  Let&rsquo;s be honest, that is what they really care about.  &ldquo;Am I going to be alright. Can I achieve my goals?&rdquo;</p><p> I wrote a while back that there are two times when an advisor really earns his or her fee.  The first is when markets are really good, and clients need a reality check.  The second is when markets are really bad. <br/> From what I have seen during this latest round of market volatility, advisors are earning their fees.  The question is, will they keep earning them?  Having a plan in place for times like this means advisors will be adding value to their clients&rsquo; financial lives for years to come.</p><p> <strong>  Keep it up. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-07 14:48:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-07 14:48:56.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_m0Ow8at.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/volatility-is-inevitable-panic-isnt-how-good-planning-calms-nervous-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"5923\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-07 14:48:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-07 14:48:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"volatility-is-inevitable-panic-isnt-how-good-planning-calms-nervous-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5922\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2704\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-07-at-7.47.51-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"971\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441713600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2639,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Key to Getting More Clients and Better Clients in Any Economic Environment","link":"the-key-to-getting-more-clients-and-better-clients-in-any-economic-environment","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billbachrach\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bill Bachrach  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.billbachrach.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bachrach &amp; Associates, Inc.  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Could your communication skills save your life? </strong> According to my colleague in the Speakers Roundtable, Capt. Charlie Plumb, the answer is YES!</p><p> He survived 6 &frac12; years in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp &ndash; the Hanoi Hilton. The same luxury accommodations as John McKain, only Charlie was there longer. Here&rsquo;s what he has to say about communication, &ldquo;I had been through the survival schools in the military and been told repeatedly, that if I were a prisoner of war to, &lsquo;maintain contact with my fellow POW&rsquo;s!&rsquo; I thought this was very logical. How else could we pass along the escape plans? Much to my surprise, the &lsquo;life saving&rsquo; value of communication in the camps wasn&rsquo;t the information we were passing around, but the simple VALIDATION of another human being! After months of solitary confinement in a very dark cell a person loses track of ones very existence. There is no sounding board &hellip; no feedback &hellip; nothing to prove that you are real. The simple tapping on a wall (shave-and-a-haircut?) and the response (six-bits) proves your existence. Someone is responding to you!</p><p> The point for a Financial Advisor: It&rsquo;s not the &lsquo;data&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the important part of the communication process. It&rsquo;s the simple validation of an individual and their pain.</p><h3> Do not underestimate the power of human connection.</h3><p> <br/> Communication is how human beings connect. Check out the rest of Charlie Plumb&rsquo;s inspiring story at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.charlieplumb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.charlieplumb.com  </a> </u> . And be prepared to stop whining. If he can survive 6 &frac12; years as a POW you can certainly survive a recession. The quality of your communication skills will help.</p><p> You may never rely on your communication skills to save your life, but they are the key to whether or not prospects and clients trust you, whether or not they move all of their money and financial affairs to you, whether or not they follow your advice, whether or not they stick with you during challenging times, and whether or not they refer you and introduce you to others.</p><p> Yes, communication skills are vital for financial advisors. What you say, how you say it, and when you say it can make all the difference in the world to your success, failure, or mediocrity.</p><p> In this article I will share some immediately implementable and results-producing ideas. And I will go beyond that and also introduce you to some of the best and brightest communicators I know and their relevant ideas. You&rsquo;ll get some of their &ldquo;nuggets&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll refer you to their books and websites so you can explore further those things which resonate with you.</p><p> Bert Decker, author of the excellent book You&rsquo;ve Got to be Believed to be Heard and the creator of <a href=\"http://www.decker.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Decker Communications  </u> </a> class says, &ldquo;the quality of your communication determines the quality of your life.&rdquo;</p><p> Patricia Fripp, one of the most precise and effective communicators in the world, quotes one of her mentors, David Palmer, as saying, &ldquo;specificity leads to credibility.&rdquo; I admire Patricia for her relentless pursuit of accurate, articulate, and specific communication. How specific is your communication?</p><p> How often do you use substitute words like &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; for the actual word that accurately describes what you meant to say? How often to you say things like &ldquo;kinda&rdquo; or &ldquo;sorta&rdquo; or other ambiguous words that make you sound like you really don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about? How much more compelling could you make your communications by being more precise with your words? Go to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fripp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.fripp.com  </a> </u>  to download excellent articles about being a better, more precise communicator.</p><p> The fundamentals of excellent communication are to know the right questions to ask and when to ask them, to listen with empathy, and when it&rsquo;s your turn to talk to articulate your ideas and your advice with conviction, in a way that&rsquo;s all about them, so your clients and your prospective clients respond positively and take appropriate action. Review your notes, script, and processes for your initial client interview with prospects and all client meetings and consider how well you do these 3 things. What questions do you ask? In what sequence do you ask your questions? Are you truly listening with empathy or are formulating in your head what you are going to say when it&rsquo;s your turn to talk again? How do you respond to prospect or client questions or comments and then come back to ask your next planned question? What is the objective for them? How can you make the experience valuable whether they hire you or not?</p><h3> Do you know what to say when the appropriate thing to do is to &ldquo;politely disengage&rdquo; and not offer to be hired?</h3><p> <br/> Having a script or talking points is not so much about memorizing the words and sounding like a robot. You have a script and / or talking points so you show prepared to create a good experience for them and a positive result for you and them. This is not a sales technique. Sometimes a positive result is deciding not to work together. The objective of good communication is to determine fit, not close the sale.</p><p> If you have been in one of my speaking engagements or attended our Academy you have heard me say, &ldquo;You build trust by listening to their story, not by telling yours.&rdquo; Patricia Fripp says, &ldquo;Sales-people often talk too much about themselves and their service or product. They make a speech rather than having an exchange or interaction, otherwise known as conversation.&rdquo; What makes it a better conversation for them is when you ask questions and they do most of the talking. And not superficial chit-chat about how long they&rsquo;ve lived in the neighborhood, the weather, or their favorite sports team. Your questions should evoke a meaningful emotional response. <u>  Giovanni Livera </u> puts it this way, &ldquo;When you connect people to their heart, you connect them to you.&rdquo;</p><p> Great communicators are truth-tellers. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are mean and completely tactless saying things like, &ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s an ugly baby.&rdquo; As <a href=\"http://www.BooherResearch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dianna Booher  </u> </a> , the author of Voices of Authority and Communicate with Confidence puts it, &ldquo;the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth should not be 3 separate things.&rdquo;  In other words, the truth should be plenty compelling to inspire your prospects and clients to action without having to resort to spin, hype, exaggeration, or embellishment to make your point about why a prospect should hire you or a client should take action based on your advice.</p><p> The most successful communicators record their meetings with their prospects and clients and listen to them so they discover the truth about their communication effectiveness and make improvements based on this truth. Recording allows you to accomplish two great results.</p><p> <strong>  1. You hear things on the recordings that help you do a better job for your clients. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. Listening to yourself makes you a better communicator in future conversations. </strong></p><p> Prospects and clients love it when financial advisors record the meetings. Why? Because your actions demonstrate that you truly care enough to get it right. Here&rsquo;s how you introduce the recorder in a way that enhances your credibility and makes it all about them, &ldquo;I appreciate the investment of time and effort you made to be here today. You&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;ll ask many relevant questions, take copious notes, and I also record the meeting. The reason for that is because I&rsquo;m very thorough. If we choose to work together, I&rsquo;ll listen to this recording at least one more time. Do you know how you can watch a movie a second or third time and see things you missed the first time?&rdquo; (Nice long pause for them to respond.) &ldquo;Well giving you advice about your money so you can achieve your goals is obviously much more important than a movie, so we want to make sure our advice is right for you.&rdquo; And then you ask your first question.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be surprised when they nod and smile because they are impressed with your thoroughness and professionalism. Only the most obnoxious and / or paranoid people would refuse to let you record. And when would you like to know you are meeting with obnoxious and / or paranoid people? The sooner the better, right?</p><p> Having taught the idea of recording prospect and client meetings for more than two decades, I have heard about a couple of firms who forbid recording client meetings. If you work for a company with a policy against recording your conversations and meetings with your prospects and clients, you should quit and find a new firm. These companies clearly do not truly care about supporting you to serve your clients at the highest level and are not dedicated to your success, nor are they client-centered. Could you imagine a professional sports franchise forbidding the players from video recording their games and viewing them to improve to serve their clients (the fans) better? Absurd.</p><p> <strong>  Great communication skills may not save your life, but they can certainly make you much more successful and happier. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-07 15:02:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-07 15:02:46.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_bMMl9ky.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-key-to-getting-more-clients-and-better-clients-in-any-economic-environment/\", \"post_id\": \"5925\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-07 15:02:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-07 15:02:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-key-to-getting-more-clients-and-better-clients-in-any-economic-environment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5924\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2705\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-07-at-8.05.40-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"437\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441741500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2640,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"15 Tips To Perfect Your On-Site SEO","link":"15-tips-to-perfect-your-on-site-seo","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clickxio\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Click X  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  When it comes to Search Engine Optimization (SEO), there are numerous strategies for you to consider and implement. </strong> That said, one of the most overlooked aspects of any SEO strategy is getting on-page optimization right.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a small business owner who relies on search engine traffic for a steady stream of new leads, then getting your on-site SEO perfected is extremely important. In fact, you can see large surges in your search engine traffic just by optimizing your website &ndash; i.e. without building a single link.</p><p> With the above said, keep reading for a full breakdown of what you can do to properly optimize the most important aspects of your website.</p><h3> 1. Optimize the URL of Every Page On Your Site</h3><p> <br/> Your site&rsquo;s URLs should be short, descriptive, and void of any complex words. If possible you should incorporate a keyword into your URL. According to Google,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stephanspencer.com/matt-cutts-interview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   keywords that are near the front of the URL  </a> </u>  are given more weight in search results.</p><p> Many WordPress users simply leave their default &lsquo;permalink&rsquo; structure and end up with a URL like http://yourcompany.com/p=45. This will only confuse your visitors and certainly won&rsquo;t work to improve your rankings.</p><h3> 2. Incorporate a Keyword Into Your Title</h3><p> <br/> The most important element you can optimize is your title tag (also know as your H1 tag). This is an excellent place to insert the keyword you want the page to rank for.</p><p> Keep in mind that the closer you place the relevant keyword towards the beginning of your title, the more effective it will be in increasing your rankings.</p><h3> 3. Use Media to Decrease Bounce Rate</h3><p> <br/> Bounce rate is calculated by how long a visitor stays on your website before hitting the back button. By adding engaging images, pictures, graphics, and videos, you&rsquo;ll be able to hold your user&rsquo;s attention longer, and increase the amount of time they spend on your website.</p><p> Bounce rate, along with the amount of time a user spends on your website, are considered important ranking factors in the eyes of Google.</p><h3> 4. Improve Page Loading Speed</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"small business on-site seo\" src=\"http://www.clickx.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/small-business-on-site-seo-image-1.png\"/></p><p> Page loading speed is a very important ranking signal. To see how your page loading speeds stack up, use a tool such as  <a href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GTMetrix </a> . This will give you a breakdown of your loading speeds, and what you can do to improve your site.</p><p> Using caching plugins, and compressing your images will also help speed up your website.</p><h3> 5. Consider Creating Longer Posts</h3><p> <br/> Post length is a hotly debated topic. However, analysis shows that  <u>  longer posts appear more frequently </u>  on the front page of Google.</p><p> Longer content can also be useful in that it enables you to incorporate more long-tail keywords, and it increases the time a user spends on your page.</p><h3> 6. Incorporate High-Profile Outbound Links</h3><p> <br/> Outbound links tell Google what your page is about. Try to link out to relevant high-quality sources every couple hundred words.</p><p> This will increase the value of your post by showing Google this page is full of high-quality information. However, be careful not to link farm or  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   Google will penalize you  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 7. Add the Ability to Easily Share Your Post</h3><p> <br/> Social sharing isn&rsquo;t currently a factor in Google&rsquo;s ranking algorithm. However, you can bet it will be in the near future.</p><p> Plus, getting your post shared across social media will bring more traffic to your website, and increase the likelihood that someone will link out to your content.</p><h3> 8. Place Your Keyword in the First 100 Words of Your Page</h3><p> <br/> Good on-site SEO will help Google understand what your page is about. A lot of people make the mistake of not including their target keyword until the middle or end of their post.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a good rule of thumb to incorporate your keyword in the first 100 words. This will let Google know what your page is about right away, and help you rank higher.</p><h3> 9. Use Long-Tail Modifiers</h3><p> <br/> Long-tail modifiers are extra keywords that you add to the end of your target keyword. These can either be long-tail keywords you&rsquo;ve uncovered in your research, or simple modifiers like &ldquo;best&rdquo; or &ldquo;review&rdquo;.</p><p> Although this won&rsquo;t get you a ton of traffic, it will help you gain small amounts of relevant traffic over time.</p><h3> 10. Have a Mobile-Responsive Website</h3><p> <br/> Google threw down the  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-algorithm-change-mobile-friendly\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mobile-optimization gauntlet  </a> </u>  earlier this year. If any portion of your traffic comes from the mobile web, then your site must be properly optimized.</p><p> You can run a test through  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Mobile Friendliness Test  </a> </u>  to see which pages are performing well and what pages still need to be optimized.</p><h3> 11. Optimize Image File Names</h3><p> <br/> The traffic you receive from an image search won&rsquo;t be very high-quality. However, every bit of traffic can help your website.</p><p> When uploading images to your website make sure you change the image file name to include the keyword you&rsquo;re trying to rank for and the relevant topic. When uploading your image you&rsquo;ll also have the ability to modify the Alt text to include your keyword as well.</p><h3> 12. Create High-Quality Content</h3><p> <br/> This can&rsquo;t be said enough. High-quality evergreen content will always be a benefit for your website. Although there&rsquo;s no direct way for the search engines to determine the quality of your content, there are a few metrics that will suggest your content is high-quality.</p><p> A few of the most common are: repeat visitors, time spent on your website, and the number of bookmarks the post receives.</p><h3> 12. Increase Time Spent on Site</h3><p> <br/> Dwell time is another metric that&rsquo;s related to bounce rate. It&rsquo;s essentially the amount of time the user stays on your website before clicking the back button.</p><p> By writing longer content the visitor will be forced to spend more time on your website, which means that even if they do leave your site, at least that click will be saved as a &ldquo;long click&rdquo;.</p><p> &ldquo;Long clicks&rdquo; are an  <u>  <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/long-click-and-the-quality-of-search-success\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   indicator of value  </a> </u>  for Google.</p><h3> 14. Utilize Other Headline Tags</h3><p> <br/> Although H2 and H3 tags aren&rsquo;t that big of a ranking indicator, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to optimize these tags as well. By using subheadings you&rsquo;ll make your post easier to read, which will increase the likelihood your visitor continuing to read your content.</p><p> When crafting your subheadings make sure to include your target keyword.</p><h3> 15. Include LSI Keywords</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"small business on-site seo\" src=\"http://www.clickx.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/small-business-on-site-seo-image-2.png\"/></p><p> LSI keywords are keywords that are related to your target keyword. These are similar to the &ldquo;long-tail modifiers&rdquo; we mentioned above, but these keywords have a guaranteed search presence.</p><p> You can find these keywords by typing your target keyword into the Google search bar and seeing which keywords appear in the drop-down bar, or related keywords section. Take note of these and incorporate them into your content.</p><h3> Bonus &ndash; Increase Your Internal Linking</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"seo-wiki\" src=\"http://www.clickx.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/seo-wiki-1024x445.png\"/></p><p> Another way to boost rankings is to improve your internal page linking structure. The internal linking master is  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\" target=\"_blank\">   Wikipedia  </a>  . </u></p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to go to their extremes, but by adding keyword links to other pages and posts on your website, it will be much easier for the search engine robots to crawl.

The importance of this came up for me while I was listening to a series of phone calls during which a sales rep was conducting a demo of a product. When the prospect asked the price, the rep gave it to him, but then he just kept talking to justify it!</p><p> <strong>  It went something like this: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Prospect: </strong> &ldquo;So how much does this cost?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Closer: </strong> &ldquo;The price for set up in your location is just $700, and then the monthly fee is just $125 per month. Of course we do a lot for you for that set up fee. It takes our tech staff blah, blah, blah&hellip; And also, that monthly fee covers blah, blah, blah. In addition, we also blah, blah, blah&hellip; And another feature with this is blah, blah, blah, blah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> What happened on this call is that the closer, in his attempt to justify the price, actually introduced a question which turned into an objection and that led to this sale being stalled. And that&rsquo;s the big danger whenever you begin talking past the close.</p><h3> What the rep should have done is use a confirmation statement to see how the price fits for the prospect.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Something like this: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Prospect: </strong> &ldquo;So how much does this cost?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Closer: </strong> &ldquo;The price for set up in your location is just $700, and then the monthly fee is just $125 per month. Does that work within your budget?&rdquo;</p><p> If building more value was required, then he could have gone into a brief explanation of that, but after that, he would still have to confirm his answer (which he and most other closers rarely do).</p><p> To take this further, if the prospect then said that it did fit within his budget, the next question would have been:</p><p> &ldquo;And do you think this will work in your company?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  If the answer to that question was yes, then: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Great! Then let me show you how to get started&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> This way, the close could have happened long before the rep talked past the sale.</p><h3> This idea of confirming your answer is crucial not just when you answer a question, but also when you answer an objection as well. </h3><p> <br/> For example, after you answer a price objection, or objection about availability or any other objection, the thing to do is confirm your answer. Use any of the following:</p><p> &ldquo;Did I answer that for you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Is that more clear now?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Does that make sense to you?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Do you see why we charge for that now?&rdquo;</p><p> Etc.</p><p> And after you do, if you get a yes or get buy in, then you ask for the order!</p><p> <strong>  Use, &ldquo;Great, then let me show you how easy it is for you to get started with this&hellip;&rdquo; </strong></p><p> If the prospect then has another question or objection, you answer that as well, confirm your answer and ask for the order, over and over again.</p><p> The point here is that if you confirm your answer, you then get to ask for the order. If you don&rsquo;t, and you&rsquo;re talking or pitching after you answer a question, then chances are, you&rsquo;ll talking past the close.

Bananas are dying of a worldwide fungus epidemic. California is still dry. And the Dow soars hundreds of points. </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re like many people, these situations make you nervous and unsure of what to do. With short-term interest rates at near zero and long-term bonds paying paltry returns (with the promise that their values will collapse at the first Fed tightening), there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a safe haven anywhere. What to do? What to do?</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s start by considering history, your expectations and what factors drive your thinking and actions.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  History: </strong>  It&rsquo;s no secret that there are recessions, expansions, stable periods and even global depression in our history. It happens. Business cycles, changes in technology, shifts in population, famine, war, scandals and new discoveries all add to the goulash of results that occur in world markets. Somehow, businesses emerge, businesses fail, companies prosper, shareholders participate in the failure and success. There is no straight-line or any predictive factors that can assist investors in always making wise choices. There are simply too many variables.</p><p> <strong>  Your expectations:  </strong> Intrinsic to your expectations comes your ability to take on risk. In other words, if history is a good teacher, we expect a given level of return for a given level of risk.</p><p> If you expect greater return without the risk, your expectations are probably skewed toward the blatantly unreasonable. Every investor expects to win&mdash;otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t enter the &ldquo;game.&rdquo; The real question is whether your expectation is realistic within the given time frame and the given level of risk.</p><p> For example, if your goal is to earn a 5% rate of return over the next five years and you are only willing to put your money in money markets and short-term treasury bills, your chance of success is pretty low considering the current state of interest rates. However, according to the Federal Reserve database (FRED), if you had been invested in those three month T-Bills from 1965-2014, your arithmetic average would have been 5.04% (geometric average 4.99%), but between 2005-2014 your return would have averaged 1.44% (geometric average 1.42%).</p><p> Another example. If you wished to grow your money at better than 5% over a long period of time, the S&amp;P 500 would have yielded 11.23% (arithmetic), and 9.84% (geometric) between 1965-2014 and 9.37% (arithmetic) and 7.60% (geometric) between 2005-2014. But that would have meant accepting negative returns in 1973 and 1974 of -14.31% and -25.9%, and years like 2000-2002 of consecutive negative returns of -9.03%, -11.85&amp; and -21.97% and of course 2008 with the stunner loss of -36.55%. Along with those down years come the days, weeks, months and years of negative news, terrible forecasts and predictions of world financial cataclysm.</p><p> <strong>  Factors driving your thinking and actions: </strong>  The behavioral finance experts tell us a great deal of our decisions come from our expectations and our beliefs. We believe that we are smart and rational. And in many ways, we are&mdash;just not when it comes to making wise investment decisions. The Dalbar QAIB (Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior) study showing investor results vs. the market is stunningly telling. In 2014, the 20-year annualized S&amp;P return was 9.85%, while the average equity mutual fund investor was only ahead 5.19%, a gap of 4.66%.</p><h3> Let that sink in a little.</h3><p> <br/> Yes, if you watch the news, read the paper, surf the net or listen to the conversations all around you, the world is crumbling and there&rsquo;s no hope. But then again, it&rsquo;s always been that way&mdash;we just know about it in real time now. The fact is, no one can predict the future, but we can learn from the past. Over-reaction most often causes unintended and unwelcome results. Do you know anyone who cashed out during the peak of the last Recession? Was it you?</p><p> <strong>  Maybe it&rsquo;s time to tune out for awhile and see if anything&mdash;other than your worry&mdash;changes. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-07 16:27:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-07 16:27:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_U0lbPFp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-do-you-mean-the-market-makes-you-nervous/\", \"post_id\": \"5931\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-07 16:27:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-07 16:27:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-do-you-mean-the-market-makes-you-nervous\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5930\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2708\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-07-at-6.19.54-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"561\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441710000,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

I found a comfortable seat a few feet from the reception desk. Having spent the early part of my career in hotel management, I still get a kick out of watching the goings-on of staff and guests. It wasn&rsquo;t long before an elderly couple sidled up to the reception desk in full view of the five receptionists busy with chatting amongst themselves, technology and administration. The elderly couple patiently waited until such time as a receptionist decided they were marginally more important than the details of her hairdressing appointment she was discussing. The elderly gentleman was clearly hard of hearing and used a walking cane to get around.</p><p> It was obvious that he needed help in a particular way because of his condition, but the receptionist wasn&rsquo;t going to let individual needs get in the way of the routine she was used to going through. Ask for a credit card, ID, stare at the computer for a long period of time, type something, stare some more and on and on. Eventually, he told her he had to sit down if he was to complete the process. As he shuffled to a nearby couch, he passed a large banner with the name of the hotel and the tagline &ldquo;Where we treat you like family.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what kind of family these hotel operators grew up with, but if they were trying to recreate a dysfunctional, emotionally unavailable family unit, they certainly succeeded.</p><h3> I despise taglines.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, I despise all kinds of tags: new clothes tags, gift tags, even skin tags. What is a tag? Something that is rarely wanted by the owner or recipient; is often thrown away or removed and holds no real value.</p><p> I believe taglines to be the cause of the most disappointment in products or services. Brands go to great lengths to share their glib taglines in the hope that you&rsquo;ll find some value in the proposition, only to be disappointed when you experience the brand and discover that that tagline didn&rsquo;t extend past the glossy marketing material.</p><p> A friend recently recalled a story where car rental company Avis had lost his reservation and had no cars left on the lot. They told him there was nothing they could do. He would have to go somewhere else. He leaned in towards the clerk at the desk, pointed to her name badge and said &ldquo;Try harder.&rdquo;</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s the issue.</h3><p> <br/> A tagline is often a poorly researched, disassociated statement that rarely extends to the front line of an organization. It is perceived as having been dreamed up by the marketing people and not having any real relevance to the operation. It doesn&rsquo;t influence decision making, doesn&rsquo;t guide behavior and often doesn&rsquo;t grant you the permission to break from routine to be the human your customer wants to deal with.</p><p> To demonstrate how little a tagline is valued by a business owner, type the word tagline into Google and the first suggestion you&rsquo;ll get is &ldquo;Tagline Generator&rdquo;. Can you imagine? There is an online tool that will spit out a statement that you will then lead all of your marketing with. It might be the most used piece of your marketing for years to come and there are people (Who are these people?) trusting an online tagline generator with this task.</p><p> Get rid of the tagline and build a brand. Stop being glib and start being genuine. A great brand is built on a set of beliefs and non-negotiables, will inform behavior, infiltrate all aspects of the organization, empower and inspire staff, satisfy customers and create loyalty, love and  <u>  <a href=\"http://brandforging.co/why-heartspace-is-a-brands-ultimate-goal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   heartpsace  </a> </u> .

Of course, the question often arises, if the ideas are so great, then why didn&rsquo;t you implement them on your own?</p><p> There are hundreds of reasons why business owners don&rsquo;t execute on growth plans. They are comfortable with the business as it now exists, the capital involved would be heavy, or perhaps the time and energy involved with implementing the growth plan was just too much for the business owner as they approach retirement.</p><p> Whatever the reason, we find that most of our clients know ways that would enhance the growth prospects of the business. We also know that buyers like to hear about these in their due diligence process.</p><p> To that end, we have included some of the areas that you might consider for growing your business. Of course this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other ways to expand your business that you could share with a buyer. The point here is that you need to include a section that provides a narrative of the top strategies that a new owner could grow the business from where it stands today.</p><p> Before we begin, keep in mind that the best time to add any growth initiative to your business is when your business is already on solid ground and operating at a high-level. Launching new growth strategies when the company is fighting to strengthen it&rsquo;s core offering is the worst possible time, and could actually do more harm than good. Hopefully, some of the methods below will help you think about the growth plans that you would recommend to the new owner of your business.</p><h3> 1. Products / Services</h3><p> <br/> When properly executed, creating new products or services in your business can build some terrific competitive advantages for your business. Having multiple offerings in your business is another way to reduce risk, and the process of new product development can go a long way in employee morale and building brand loyalty within your customer base.</p><p> One of the first strategies that we recommend looking into in order to broaden or strengthen your product mix is by offering a premium version of your core product or service. Think about what other items that you could offer to your existing customers that would get them to pay a higher price for a better version of what they already buy from you.</p><p> Some companies get 4 to 10 times the amount of their core offerings by building out more value-added products or services. Offering these premium versions to existing customers and adding an up-sell component to your sales process could lead to higher profits for the business. Up-sells can also increase customer loyalty, and selling items to existing customers is the best way to grow without increasing customer acquisition costs.</p><p> Think about your existing offerings and how you could develop complimentary products or services. What other extensions to your services can you offer customers?</p><h3> 2. Geographical Expansion</h3><p> <br/> Many businesses are perfectly suited for growth, but they have reached the maximum potential of their existing geographical market share. Perhaps your business could benefit the new owner by expanding into new geographic locations. It is important to present as much context as possible around these expansion opportunities.</p><p> One of our clients had a lot of existing customers requesting that they open another location in a market about 50 miles away. The vendors for this business were also quoted as saying that the opportunity for a new location in this market was incredible. These facts helped a buyer get excited about the prospects of expanding into this market. We have also seen sellers list the ideal demographics of the market that they feel would support an additional location for the business.</p><p> We see a lot of business owners that have &ldquo;blinders on.&rdquo; They are very comfortable with their success, and the thought of opening another branch or satellite office sounds exhausting. Expanding into new markets is one of the most underutilized strategies for growth, and it makes sense to present this option to the potential buyer.</p><h3> 3. Customer Segments</h3><p> <br/> Some owners fail to properly attack a new customer segment, and this could create an enormous opportunity for a new buyer. For instance, we recently worked with a business that had no outside sales force. They generated all of their revenue through websites where potential customers called in and talked to an internal service representative about their services. Most of their competitors called on a variety of business leads and had their own salespeople. Ultimately, a buyer with a strong sales background bought the business after seeing the opportunity to build stronger relationships with professional salespeople out in the field.</p><p> Think about the growth opportunities that come with adding new customer segments to your client mix. The prospects that come with these new segments could be helpful when it comes to motivate the perfect buyer for your business.</p><h3> 4. People</h3><p> <br/> Often times it can be the addition of key people to an organization that can make all of the difference to the future growth plans. If your business could benefit from a key manager or a better sales force, then this is the place where you want to include a description of these roles within your company.</p><p> A buyer will likely look for your input when it comes to the types of positions that need to be filled in order to hit key growth targets in the business, so it is important to think this through. Is there a position in your business that you just never got around to filling that could improve the business?</p><h3> 5. Technology</h3><p> <br/> Many of the business owners that we talk with have at least one area of their business where an improvement in technology could benefit their future growth prospects. Helping a new buyer get their arms around these growth opportunities is always helpful.</p><p> One of our clients spent years creating a state-of-the-art operating system, and listed licensing this technology to competitors and other specialty trades as a potential growth opportunity. The buyer that they chose to go with was impressed with the thought of this concept, and the idea helped him get that much closer to saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the deal.</p><p> Think about every part of your business, and ask yourself what areas could technology help my company grow?</p><h3> 6. Strategic Partnerships</h3><p> <br/> Good strategic partnerships can come in many forms. One of the most common strategic partner is another business. When done correctly, striking an agreement with another business can lead to more sales for both parties involved. So, what industries could you send referrals to, and how could they be enticed to reciprocate?</p><p> A consulting client of ours owns a large business that is in the construction management industry. They have their finger on the pulse of development opportunities within the cities where they maintain operations. They have forged some excellent strategic partnerships with architectural firms. Our client gets them involved in new projects, and the architectural firms bring them into projects that they&rsquo;re involved with. It creates a perfect win-win situation.</p><p> What industries, or better yet specific companies, are in your marketplace that a new buyer could build stronger relationships with?</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-07 16:55:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-07 16:55:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_9moCtRx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-growth-strategies-that-helped-me-sell-my-business/\", \"post_id\": \"5935\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-07 16:55:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-07 16:55:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-growth-strategies-that-helped-me-sell-my-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5934\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2710\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-07-at-10.01.31-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"669\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441735200,"author_id":274,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2645,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Concepts That Explain All Your Problems","link":"3-concepts-that-explain-all-your-problems","source_link":null,"content":"<p> No, I&rsquo;m not a psychiatrist or psychologist. So, what makes me qualified from commenting on how our brain motivates human behavior? Even though I&rsquo;ve been a medical doctor for more than twenty five years, still doesn&rsquo;t make me more qualified than you, or a psychologist, to do the same. Simply experience life, be open-minded, and look into yourselves and you are just as qualified. After all, those experts, research has just shown, have produced major psychological studies, about how we are supposed to react, that have been either debunked or not replicable in over 60% of the cases! (Google it, it&rsquo;s true). Although I point these questions at you and direct this blog to you, everything I write comes directly from looking into myself and from my personal and professional experiences. So, though what I write may not seem as though it is about me, it is!</p><p> But in this short blog, I am going to expose to you what I have found as the three characteristics of our brain that are behind every single self-sabotaging thought you have ever had, behind every single financial struggle you may face, behind every single relationship challenge you may have, and yes, perhaps most if not all health issues you face. <strong>  So fasten your seat belts, because here we go! </strong></p><p> As humans we differ from animals in the fact that we possess a consciousness&mdash;our higher mind&mdash;which I believe to be our connection with some supernatural entity, which I (and others) call God. It is my belief (and science seems to bear this out) that this mind came into existence somewhere from six to ten thousand years ago. However, that is not the part that controls most human behavior and thought. What does, is the primitive part of our brain, which has evolved over the past tens of thousands of years. This primitive part, I call the automatic brain (AB for short), and some have called the Devil. The AB is part reptilian, is completely reactive, and animalistic. The only feature that separates us from the animals is that our frontal cortex is more highly evolved and therefore this primitive brain is capable of thought. But thought or no thought, it operates the same way as animals&mdash;to do whatever it takes, but any means necessary to fight or flee what it processes as danger, threat, or vulnerability.</p><p> And here is where the three characteristics come in. Where and when do we humans learn about danger? Are we a blank slate at birth? We are not a blank slate, but our innate danger &ldquo;folders&rdquo; are. And these three folders are where you will find everything you need to know about all that you dislike about yourself and the world.</p><p> <strong>  The three danger folders are: The One-Up, Leaving Comfort Zone, and Losing Love (more technically, losing security). </strong></p><h3> 1. The One-Up Folder</h3><p> <br/> We learn at an early age who, what, or where might cause us danger. Animals and smaller creatures, have the same innate folder. Do you think a spider actually knows that you can crush it? What it does &ldquo;know&rdquo; is that the vibration it feels when you hit up against where it has spun its web means that you are &ldquo;one-up&rdquo; from it and it flees or fights (bites you) if cornered. Perhaps as a child stored deep in your folder, you learned that people richer than you pose a threat to you. You will fight and flee these people as adults. This AB has us scanning the landscape 24/7 for those people, places, or things to which we may be one-up or are one-up to us, thus representing potential danger. Look at every single conflict on earth and see if you can&rsquo;t find one that does not stem from humans fighting and fleeing the danger of being &ldquo;one-upped&rdquo;.</p><h3> 2. Leaving  the Comfort Zone</h3><p> <br/> It seems obvious that this could be a danger. But what you may not realize is that comfort zones don&rsquo;t always mean a place that is right and safe for us. Since the AB doesn&rsquo;t think (don&rsquo;t confuse that with the generation of thoughts), if it detects something regular, usual, or expected it will keep you there because this is a hard-wired instinct, shared by our fellow animals. You may have grown up in a household where fighting, substance abuse, perhaps even physical, emotional, or verbal abuse were common. Your AB will store this in your folder so that when you venture out as an adult you may find yourself fighting and fleeing the opposite of these things because that is what you are used to&mdash;your norm, your expected, your &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; zone. And you wonder why you keep falling into dysfunctional relationships?  For most, being comfortably uncomfortable is less dangerous than the unknown, essentially what lies outside this zone.</p><h3> 3. Losing Love</h3><p> <br/> While in medical school, I learned of a famous experiment (and yes, one that has been replicated) where a baby monkey was taken away from its mother. The baby was given all the food it needed, yet it lost weight, did not thrive, and in some cases withered away close to death. The AB has evolved to innately detect the threat of losing love as a potential danger, threat, or situation of great vulnerability. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am as romantic as the next guy. However, this primitive instinct is really not about true love, but security. In my estimation, our dogs don&rsquo;t really love us as much as they feel secure around us. Therefore, this AB, primitive folder is more about the threat of losing security and we will fight and flee anything that threatens that. Flashback to your childhood. What if your family was one where weight issues were always a challenge? I mean, everyone was overweight. You might say it is in your genes and that is why you are overweight. But what if I were to say that you have been fighting and fleeing a more fit body, because one, if you were different from your family you would risk losing their love; or two, being overweight was your families comfort zone and is now yours.</p><p> <strong>  I would encourage you to first look at your own life and then the circumstances in the world and see if you can place any challenge in one of these folders. </strong> I would be surprised if you couldn&rsquo;t find one that didn&rsquo;t match. Some of you may think, &lsquo;this supports what I have thought about everyone else and reaffirms how messed up everyone is&rsquo;. Let me caution you to understand that ALL of us possess this brain (as well as our higher, Divine, mind). There are times where we indeed must protect ourselves from the ABs of others, but that is a (political) discussion for another time and place.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-07 17:25:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-07 17:25:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_hRahe8w.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-concepts-that-explain-all-your-problems/\", \"post_id\": \"5937\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-07 17:25:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-07 17:25:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-concepts-that-explain-all-your-problems\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5936\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2711\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-07-at-10.27.54-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"520\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441712700,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2647,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seeing the Bright Side of a Key Account Loss","link":"seeing-the-bright-side-of-a-key-account-loss","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Met Office  </a> </u>  isn't the only company to have faced the dilemma of losing a major account (in this case the BBC).  A lot of professional firms can struggle not to be overly dependent on a few large client accounts, the loss of which can cause significant disruption. <br/> <br/> Often the reaction of the firm is to commence a somewhat frenzied new business campaign designed to replace lost revenue and this is understandable, particularly so when a firm fears that to do otherwise would put jobs at risk.</p><h3> However before getting too caught up in the frenzy, it's worth bearing the following in mind: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Is the client gone in total and/or for good? </strong> Final decisions are often not as final as they seem and there is frequently an opportunity to preserve at least some part of relationship. Even a small part can be better than nothing revenue-wise and keeping a foot in the door can be useful in case the client finds the grass isn&rsquo;t greener on the other side after all. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  In my experience few firms do this, but it is worth making sure you really understand why a key client relationship has failed. </strong> There might be some valuable lessons for the future. Exit interviews maintain a constructive dialogue with departing clients and help transition the relationship in a positive way. It helps leave the door at least a little ajar and makes it easier for a client to pass back some business at a later stage if they feel lessons have been learned. Also over the long course of our collective careers who knows where we will be in 5, 10, 15, 20 years&rsquo; time - maintaining positive relationships with firms and individuals might yield unexpected fruit at an unexpected time. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Maintaining that dialogue is also important for your firm&rsquo;s reputation. </strong> There is no shame in having lost a large client &ndash; there can be a myriad of reasons for this happening. What that client says about you when asked however is important.

According to Cerulli, 71% of the advisor population is over the age of 45, and the average advisor is 51&frac12; years old. <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a> As these advisors reach retirement age, some 8,600 are expected to leave the profession every year for the next 13 years, thinning the ranks of advisors at a 2.7 percent annual clip. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2] </a> Unfortunately, for every eight advisors that retire, only three are trained to replace them. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [3] </a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nReplenishing the ranks of older advisors with younger advisors is one of the major challenges the industry now faces, and this challenge exists on at least two fronts. The first is the issue of succession planning for established advisory practices in which the principals are at or close to retirement age and looking to pass the torch to the next generation. The other is simply finding and attracting enough viable candidates among Gen Y <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [4] </a> to fill the expected volume of job openings in the coming years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn response, many firms are taking steps to think differently, create new strategies and implement programs to boost their recruiting efforts. Unfortunately, in some cases those efforts may be hindered by some existing misconceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Uncovering Common Misconceptions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOne commonly held misperception is that there is a widespread lack of interest in the financial advisory profession among Gen Y, but the Fidelity&reg; Recruiting Redefined Study (Fidelity study) revealed that lack of awareness, not interest, is a more relevant factor. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [5] </a> Only two in 10 college students and young professionals responding to the Fidelity study were familiar with the financial advisor profession, but after learning more about it, almost half indicated they would consider it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fidelity study identified a number of false impressions that can exist among Millennials <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [6] </a> : that you need licenses and certifications to be a qualified candidate, that sales activities are the most important part of the job, and that the profession doesn&rsquo;t offer the kind of opportunity to help others that is so important to many in this age group.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat last point is an important one for firms looking to tap the Gen Y talent pool. In a 2013 survey of 1,000 college‐educated men and women born since 1980, 84 percent agreed with this statement: &ldquo;Knowing I am making a difference in the world is more important to me than professional recognition.&rdquo; <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [7] </a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the Fidelity study, too few Millennials currently see a financial profession as a pathway to making a difference, largely due to limited awareness of this career among college students.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fidelity Recruiting Redefined study identified three steps that firms and others seeking to recruit young talent to the financial advice profession may want to consider taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continue to <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/294941957;120431532;g\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> full article </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also be interested in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/294941956;120431532;f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Recruiting Redefined </a></li>\r\n\t<li>Take the Quiz: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/294941955;120431532;e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Perspectives on the looming advisor talent shortage </a></li>\r\n\t<li>2013 Fidelity&reg; Millionaire Outlook Executive Summary: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/294941958;120431532;h\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gen X/Y Millionaires Not Sitting Idle </a></li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a> Cerulli Quantitative Update, Advisor Metrics 2013, Understanding and Addressing a More Sophisticated Population, Cerulli Associates.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a> Ibid.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a> Ibid.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a> Born from 1980 to 1992.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a> Fidelity&reg; Recruiting Redefined Study, September 2014.

Participants included 813 advisors from across multiple firm types who work primarily with individual investors and manage a minimum of $10 million in individual or household investable assets.

That means that, while not panicking, most Millennials may have been missing one of the biggest potential opportunities of the past 10 years.</p><h3> Why Aren&rsquo;t Millennials Investing?</h3><p> <br/> There are many theories &ndash;from Millennials being shell-shocked by experiencing their families&rsquo; anxiety in 2008, to YOLO, the feeling that it&rsquo;s better to spend and enjoy the money now because who knows what the future may bring. The problem is that the future is likely to bring a whole lot fewer opportunities if you haven&rsquo;t planned properly!</p><h3> Are You Even Beating Inflation?</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s say hypothetically that the stock market may rebound by 5%&hellip; Simple, common sense math shows that keeping your money in the bank at .05% interest means it would take you 100 years to make the same amount of money that investing it now could. And the cash you are saving under the mattress or in one of your vintage vinyl sleeves? That money is just losing value every second you leave it there, as the cost of blankets and concert tickets continues to climb with inflation.</p><h3> Risk, Volatility, and Paper Losses</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s important to know the difference between risk and volatility and many people get it wrong.</p><p> Volatility &ndash; stock prices moving up and down &ndash; is a normal part of the stock market and an opportunity for a disciplined saver to buy when the market is both up and down. When you have a solid plan in place you can capitalize on market price dislocations, like what happened this week. Risk is how likely you are to lose it all and it&rsquo;s important to remember &ndash; while everyone has their own risk tolerance &ndash; price corrections and market volatility does not necessarily mean you are going to lose it all. As the chart below borrowed from The Irrelevant Investor&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://theirrelevantinvestor.wordpress.com/2015/08/24/should-investors-stay-the-course/#more-1843\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   excellent post  </a> </u>  on staying the course shows, the stock market has historically climbed in spite of dips. And paper losses are just that: it&rsquo;s not real loss if you don&rsquo;t sell.</p><p> .</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"stock market drops\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-23-at-3-06-42-pm.png\"/> </a></p><p> As this chart by Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.in/There-are-2-big-problems-with-blaming-China-for-the-stock-market-sell-off/articleshow/48670991.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Torsten Slok  </a> </u>  shows, in spite of other times of great volatility, markets have always recovered. It&rsquo;s just a question of timing.</p><p>  </p><p> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CNQVAncWwAAtuB7-1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"torsten\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CNQVAncWwAAtuB7-1.png\"/> </a></p><h3> Millennials: This is Your Wake-up Call</h3><p> <br/> When I speak to fellow Millennials, they say that the real reasons they don&rsquo;t invest are that 1) it&rsquo;s daunting to get started and 2) they don&rsquo;t know where to get help. The big companies aren&rsquo;t interested in smaller investors with less than  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wealthprofessional.ca/news/mega-firm-cuts-small-accounts-194854.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   250-500K  </a> </u>  and the robo solutions don&rsquo;t understand what makes each smaller investor&rsquo;s situation unique. There&rsquo;s a whole new breed of financial advisors, however, who combine personalized service with targeted tech solutions for smaller investors. So no excuses &ndash; there are financial pros ready help you create an investment strategy that makes sense for your personal goals and financial situation. And volatility doesn&rsquo;t disrupt what we do!</p><h3> The Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve got a solid financial plan, investing in the stock market does not affect your ability to pay your rent, take care of yourself or your family, or add to that rainy day emergency fund. The money you&rsquo;re saving and investing is money that you&rsquo;ve determined you don&rsquo;t need now, it&rsquo;s money you have set aside for the long haul. Assuming your planner has planned correctly, you&rsquo;re not going to miss your car payment because the Chinese stock market is crashing.</p><p> And that huge correction that scared you in 2008? It eventually rebounded and the market continued to climb. As a Millennial you&rsquo;ve got years on your side if you start investing now. And you&rsquo;re losing the potential for growth and compounded interest every moment you wait.</p><p> Baron Rothschild, of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying &ldquo;The time to buy is when there&rsquo;s blood in the streets.&rdquo;</p><p> Look around.

{"original_id":2651,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Take a Social Media Break NOW!","link":"take-a-social-media-break-now","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Reading this title your mouth might be on the ground &ndash; what did she say? (Well, write..)</p><p> I said, take a social media break. Soon. Very soon. And for as long as you can.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the deal &ndash; I love social media and the power it holds to turn a business into a brand, to connect people, and how it offers a way to interact like we&rsquo;ve never known before.</p><h3> But we need to keep social media in its place.</h3><p> <br/> This probably sounds crazy considering I am the CEO of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://archdigitalagency.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media agency  </a> </u>  (that RrrrrOCKS) and social media is my bread &amp; butter, but that doesn&rsquo;t change what I know and believe.</p><p> People are always cautious when telling me they don&rsquo;t have a Facebook account or aren&rsquo;t into social media. They shuffle their feet and speak in a quiet voice like someone may come rushing out and clobber them over the head. Or I get the defiant &ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T DO THAT,&rdquo; which is also comical.</p><p> But I understand why people want to keep a safe distance from social media or why they prefer to not be involved at all. I get that it&rsquo;s not for everyone &ndash; nothing is for everyone. And if you&rsquo;re reading this and nodding your head in agreement, sweet!</p><p> However for most of us, we can&rsquo;t disconnect. We love social media on such a deep level that we lose sleep over it, Tweets and messages beckon us when the sun comes up, and we simply can&rsquo;t wait to get online.</p><p> Either way, for we social media lovers, it&rsquo;s time to learn to keep it in its place. And by that, I mean we need to learn how to use social media for our benefit and not let it use us for its benefit. That may twist your mind up, but all I&rsquo;m trying to say is that we need to be purposeful with our social media usage.</p><p> Do you know, like reallyyyyyy know why you use social media? Or what your purpose or goal is with it? Or are you simply doing it because everyone else is?</p><p> Last month I ran away for a weekend at a monastery, and took the first social media break since I started my business in 2012. Crazy, right? Well (BIG surprise), it was life changing. Not only because I broke a few habits during those quiet days, but also renewed my perspective on how much time we spend online.</p><p> I left this quiet cove to return to a loud world that&rsquo;s walking around with an electronic piece in front of its face. I saw families in restaurants where everyone is online instead of talking to one another. I saw people walking the aisles of a grocery store while perusing Facebook. And I saw a video of someone on a carousel ride with his friends who was filming the activity, but everyone was on their cell phone!!</p><h3> What. the. heck.</h3><p> <br/> But maybe you don&rsquo;t see it this way. Maybe you think I&rsquo;m a little crazy, and that&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m going to break it down for you with my top reasons why a social media break should be in your near future.</p><h3> 1. FOMO isn&rsquo;t cool.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t familiar with the acronym FOMO, it means Fear Of Missing Out.</p><p> Everyone has experienced this in life, especially in our younger years. Remember being home when your friends were out or having to do homework in college during a major rivalry game? We&rsquo;ve all experienced it.</p><p> But lately I&rsquo;ve seen this craze for FOMO with social media like it&rsquo;s a cool thing. And it&rsquo;s not!</p><p> This whole FOMO feeling in relation to social media creates additional chaos. It causes us to lose sleep, to miss out on precious moments with family and friends, to stay connected to a lit screen that has zero love for us, and begins playing havoc with our self esteem.</p><p> I&rsquo;m guilty of it, too! I don&rsquo;t know how many nights I needed to get to bed early and my phone starts blowing up with online notifications, and I can&rsquo;t. walk. away. Gah!</p><p> We need to learn to be okay with missing out. We need to learn to place boundaries for ourselves in terms of when we are online and when we aren&rsquo;t.</p><p> FOMO is a hyped up heart attack waiting to happen and it needs to be extinguished. Not being able to disconnect for fear of missing out says more about our self esteem than our cool factor.</p><h3> 2. Breaks down productivity.</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; are you more or less productive since social media has taken over?</p><p> I can guarantee you that I&rsquo;m less productive. Right this minute, I&rsquo;m trying to knock out this blog, and I&rsquo;ve got notifications on my cell phone popping up, and the Facebook tab telling me I have things to check.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s SO hard not to look! Isn&rsquo;t that ridiculous?</p><p> To get a blog written these days, I have to minimize my browser, hide my cellphone, and use TextEdit so I&rsquo;m not distracted. This coming from a girl who&rsquo;s had a journal since she was 7. I love to write, but it&rsquo;s hard to let go and get knee deep with words when there&rsquo;s notifications going off.</p><p> The downfall of productivity is so bad there&rsquo;s ALL kinds of apps and plugins available to prevent us from seeing notifications or automatically shuts down parts of our computer so we can focus on our tasks.</p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to regain control over your productivity and stop feeling like a slave to notifications?</p><h3> 3. Increases depression and comparison.</h3><p> <br/> For me, this is one of the biggest reasons we need to take social media breaks &ndash; social media can deplete our self-esteem and increase our competitive spirit (NOT in a good way).</p><p> Have you ever been trying to lose weight, attain a goal or grow your business, and then you see a friend or colleague who&rsquo;s KILLING it in that area? How does it make you feel? Do you feel down?</p><p> A lot of people do. I certainly have. And I think that&rsquo;s pretty normal. We naturally compare ourselves to others &ndash; not that it&rsquo;s a good thing because I don&rsquo;t believe it is. But we do. And although we strive to not compare ourselves, social media has a way of making it more difficult because we see the accomplishments of others everyday.</p><p> We see the pretty pictures, the goals made, the big smiles, and if we&rsquo;re having a tough day, it can can feel like we&rsquo;re drowning or make us question what we&rsquo;re doing wrong.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll be honest, there are days I purposefully stay away from social media perusing because I&rsquo;m not feeling so great about myself. Call it what you will, but I know these feelings are irrational, so I choose to not play with fire.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no shortage of articles these days about how social media is making us more depressed, and that&rsquo;s because we see all the glory and not enough of the struggle.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve counseled new business owners, and the one thing I always advise is to find a community of entrepreneurs to share their journey and pain with because there&rsquo;s so much we miss by only viewing what&rsquo;s online.</p><p> A wise person once said, Comparison is the thief of joy, and that&rsquo;s the truth.</p><p> But when we step away from social media and realign ourself with who we really are, we are capable of seeing it for what it is, and we can focus on OUR journey.</p><p> A wise person once said, Comparison is the thief of joy, and that&rsquo;s the truth.</p><p> But when we step away from social media and realign ourself with who we really are, we are capable of seeing it for what it is, and we can focus on OUR journey.</p><h3> 4. Social media isn&rsquo;t everything.</h3><p> <br/> Bottom line, social media isn&rsquo;t everything. It&rsquo;s not our everyday life, it&rsquo;s not a real world, it&rsquo;s simply where we hang out or market our businesses. We can&rsquo;t tie our self-esteem to it&rsquo;s tail or allow it to control our lives.</p><p> Social media is an awesomeeee way for businesses to develop relationships with their customers and prospects, it&rsquo;s a place to share photos and exchange with our loved ones we don&rsquo;t get to see enough, and it&rsquo;s a place for us all to learn more about the world we live in.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s not what rules the world, it&rsquo;s not a popularity contest, AND we only see what others allow us to see, i.e. the pretty sides of life.</p><p> We rarely see the struggles, work, tired faces, and morning dreads &ndash; and that&rsquo;s important to remember.</p><p> I didn&rsquo;t write this article to bum you out on social media because I LOVEEE social media! It&rsquo;s a beautiful tool to change the world, to educate, to sell, and to connect people, but it&rsquo;s just that &ndash; a tool.</p><p> And we must do our best to keep it in it&rsquo;s place.</p><p> So log off the computer or get off your cellphone and go enjoy life! Be present with your friends and family, smell your food, enjoy a movie or go for a walk!</p><p> REAL life isn&rsquo;t lived on social media &ndash; it just looks like it is.</p><h3> Disagree with me?

{"original_id":2652,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: If Only Managing Technology Were This Easy …","link":"advisors-if-only-managing-technology-were-this-easy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You&rsquo;ve probably heard them many times. One-liners about how easy managing technology is, or could be, if only you:</p><li> Designate someone as the firm &ldquo;techie&rdquo;</li><li> Outsource all of your technology needs</li><li> Agree that (pick a tech) is the backbone of your firm&rsquo;s business</li><li> Implement an all-in-one solution <br/>  </li><h3> My elevator speech begins with &ldquo;Imagine technology doing exactly what you want it to do.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> I then need to wait three seconds before continuing due to the chuckles it draws. With the abundance of technology tools to manage your business and deliver the utmost client experience, the sentence shouldn&rsquo;t be a pipedream. Why the chuckles?</p><p> Somehow, all of the choices created an &ldquo;information overload&rdquo; problem for advisors. How many products can you name for tools such as CRM, planning, document management, rebalancing, and portfolio reporting? Now add categories like all-in-one or best-in-breed to the equation. Throw in work-flow processes, security, client behavior, PFM, and integration. Last, but not least, look closely at your firm&rsquo;s needs. Then, make the right decision.</p><h3> Reasons why managing technology isn&rsquo;t as easy as one-liners suggest:</h3><p> <br/> You need to manage, and budget for, all of the tech components &ndash; Managing technology comprises all of the components that support your firm, including:</p><li> Technology infrastructure: Hardware, server, cloud, back-up, e-mail, phone system, and security</li><li> Operations and administration: Client and internal management tools such as CRM, document management, and billing/accounting</li><li> Portfolio management and data analysis: Portfolio reporting, risk management, financial planning, rebalancing, and trading</li><li> Client experience and communication: Portals, scheduling software, and back-end reporting tools</li><li> Personal devices: Mobile, tablets, and other personal tools that belong to your staff <br/>  </li><p> Is compliance a subset of technology or technology a subset of compliance? With technology deeply integrated into your business, it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to determine which area an issue falls under. For example, is technology that is used to monitor social media and archiving managed by the COO/CTO or CCO?</p><p> Best-in-Breed options come with a twist &ndash; One of the benefits of best-in-breed was that advisors could select the best technology tools for their firm. The only drawback was integration. Now, integration capabilities exist, but with selected software of which your desired software may not be included. Technology has evolved from advisors being in control to vendors determining your best-in-breed options.</p><p> Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to manage what you don&rsquo;t know &ndash; You want to ensure data security, but don&rsquo;t know what questions to ask. You know what the new technology will do, but aren&rsquo;t sure how your processes will change as a result. You understand what other firms are doing, or using, but can&rsquo;t picture if that is right for your firm.</p><h3> While managing technology isn&rsquo;t easy, it can be easier to manage if you:</h3><p> <br/> Think internally first, not externally &ndash; An advisor asked me about rebalancing software he was evaluating. While I said the software was good, I needed to ask about the firm&rsquo;s process. Is there a firm-wide rebalancing process or did each manager have his/her own rules for rebalancing portfolios? The answer will lead into more questions about the firm&rsquo;s process until we can define the firm&rsquo;s rebalancing needs. Then, I could answer what I thought of that particular software. Defining the firm&rsquo;s needs took longer than anticipated.</p><p> <strong>  Many advisors seem to know more about the technology products in the market than they know their own firm&rsquo;s needs. While we know that technology is an investment, the wrong technology is a costly mistake. </strong></p><p> Merge your technology plan with your business plan &ndash; Many firms develop a plan or ideas to add value to their current business model, and then think about technology later in the process. Define upfront how technology should be used to support your ideas. If your goal is to add services such as financial planning, focus on niche markets, or incorporate a robo-advisor platform, compare the components listed above to your business needs and existing structure. This enables you to see how several areas can benefit from the same technology, find conflicts that need resolving, and better assess which areas need immediate attention.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-08 18:03:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-08 18:03:26.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_KiN6OTz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-if-only-managing-technology-were-this-easy/\", \"post_id\": \"5950\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-08 18:03:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-08 18:03:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-if-only-managing-technology-were-this-easy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5949\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2718\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-08-at-11.03.26-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"418\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441801800,"author_id":462,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2653,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Narcissism is TOO Alive and Well on LinkedIn","link":"narcissism-is-too-alive-and-well-on-linkedin","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As I was going through my LinkedIn requests to connect last week, I noticed a growing trend on professional headlines that I pray will disappear faster than parachute pants in the 80&rsquo;s did.  What about those professionals who feel comfortable calling themselves &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and &ldquo;gurus&rdquo; and even the ones that say &ldquo;ninja&rdquo; and &ldquo;master authority&rdquo;?  Hmm&hellip;really?</p><h3> Expertise is a funny thing.  </h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m all for taking the time to maintain your profile on LinkedIn. It is super important and we all want to put our best foot forward so people know we are dynamic human beings, but should people feel THAT comfortable with these sorts of words?  To present themselves as the &lsquo;guiding light&rsquo; of their profession?  Who are these individuals REALLY trying to impress: themselves or potential clients?</p><p> Out of sheer curiosity, I went to three very familiar people&rsquo;s profiles to see if they even had a LinkedIn profile (they did!) and then wondered, &ldquo;What does it say about them?&rdquo;  Here we go!</p><p> <u>  <strong>   President Barack Obama  </strong> </u>  &ndash; his professional headline merely said, &ldquo;President of the United States of America&rdquo;.  Regardless of what you think of him politically, he&rsquo;s legit one of the most powerful people in the world and yet I looked &ndash; trust me, I read every single word &ndash; and nowhere does it say &ldquo;expert&rdquo; or &ldquo;guru&rdquo;.  Nope, not there and he has more than 2 million followers.</p><p> Next up was  <u>  <strong>   Sir Richard Branson  </strong> </u> , the founder of Virgin Airlines.  I checked out his LinkedIn profile too and he admits he is a tie-loathing adventurer, but nothing about being a &ldquo;wind warrior&rdquo; or that he owns more than 400 companies. What about his net worth which is estimated at $5.1 billion dollars?  Surely that qualifies him as a &ldquo;guru&rdquo;?  Nope &ndash; he just hates ties. [My husband does too!]</p><p> That leaves  <strong>  <u>   Reid Hoffmann  </u> </strong> .  He&rsquo;s the co-founder of LinkedIn, is on the board of Airbnb and is the partner of Greylock.  Now he must be using these words because he helped create LinkedIn, right?  I read the profile from top-to-bottom.  His only reference is that LinkedIn will help you FIND experts, but not that he is one.  Hmm&hellip; I would have thought for certain we would find it here!</p><p> So, if these accomplished individuals are not using these words,</p><h3> Why on Earth is Anyone Else?</h3><p> <br/> Next, it led me to Google the phrase, &ldquo;What makes someone an expert?&rdquo; and in less than a second 153,000,000 articles were returned by people, who probably think they are experts.  The only reasonable explanation was from Wikipedia which cracked me up because anyone can change that to suit their needs, so now it begs me to question for financial professionals,&ldquo;Is there anyone wondering why compliance officers hate this word so much?&rdquo; An expert cannot be deemed by one person to someone else.  Collectively, we need to stop using these terms to make us feel better about ourselves and start using words that make clients want to work with us.  Let&rsquo;s all get over ourselves!</p><p> Also, I&rsquo;m not sure if you noticed that in each of the profiles above, they all did have one thing in common.  The word &ldquo;Influencer&rdquo; was assigned by LinkedIn to their profiles.  Why did LinkedIn strategically use that word versus &ldquo;Ninja&rdquo;?   <a href=\"http://dorieclark.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dorie Clark  </u>    </a> explains it quickly and concisely in this recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://links.mkt3142.com/servlet/MailView?ms=MTIyMzU2MTYS1&amp;r=MjQ3OTc4MzUzNwS2&amp;j=NjAxODkyNTE1S0&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review Tip of the Day  </a> </u> :</p><h3> Influence Others Even If You&rsquo;re Not an Expert</h3><p> <br/> One of the most powerful forms of influence is authority, especially when it comes from your expertise. If you have 20 years of experience or you write for a certain publication, you have an increased ability to influence others. But how do you influence people if you don&rsquo;t have those credentials? The first step is to borrow others&rsquo; expertise. If you&rsquo;re a thoughtful curator of the best ideas in your field, people will turn to you for guidance. Another technique is to find commonalities with your audience. Having something in common can create a powerful psychological bond. It&rsquo;s also important tobe strategic with your persuasion. If you can&rsquo;t directly contact the person you&rsquo;re trying to influence, try talking to someone close to them instead. Finally,create original content. Choose a platform that makes sense for you, then share about the issues in your field to build your reputation.</p><p> Adapted from &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://links.mkt3142.com/ctt?kn=23&amp;ms=MTIyMzU2MTYS1&amp;r=MjQ3OTc4MzUzNwS2&amp;b=0&amp;j=NjAxODkyNTE1S0&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Get People to Listen to You When You&rsquo;re Not Seen as an Expert  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; by Dorie Clark.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  Authority is a drug.  Presidents of countries and companies can certainly command a room, but that is mostly due to their influence over others rather than their expertise alone.  Once anyone gets to that level, they depend on teams of expertise and not on their own smarts.  So, when you depend on a team of expertise, does that warrant you to say you&rsquo;re an expert?  I definitely think not.</p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather be known as an &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; than an expert?  Start thinking about how you influence others in your practice.  Look at your words and ask others how they feel when they read your website or bio&hellip;and you need someone who will be grossly honest with you and honor the term &ldquo;truth over peace&rdquo;.  Be ready to hear the real deal.  It might sting, but it&rsquo;s for your own good.  Influence your connections, forget about being a know-it-all.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC!</p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-08 18:19:43.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-08 18:19:43.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_puL9iiH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/narcissism-is-too-alive-and-well-on-linkedin/\", \"post_id\": \"5952\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-08 18:19:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-08 18:19:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"narcissism-is-too-alive-and-well-on-linkedin\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5951\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2719\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-08-at-11.27.18-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"615\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441818900,"author_id":441,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2654,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Should the Social Security Retirement Age Be Raised?","link":"should-the-social-security-retirement-age-be-raised","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  As the federal election rhetoric heats up, changes to social security benefits will most certainly be a part of the dialogue. It is likely not a matter of \"will changes to social security happen\" but rather \"what will the changes be and when\". </strong> <br/> <br/> To be clear, most all of the potential changes to social security being proposed are likely to have a profound affect on retirement benefits for millions of Americans. Therefore, it is extremely important to fully understand the effects of any of the proposed changes before you dismiss them as having little impact on your personal retirement picture. <br/> <br/> One of the proposed changes to \"fix\" social security is to (once again) raise the age at which they kick in. For most American's approaching retirement now, their social security \"full retirement age (FRA)\" is age 66. If you were born in 1960 or later, however, the FRA is 67. But some political candidates are now proposing to push out the FRA to age 69 or even 70.</p><h3> So what's the big deal about raising the retirement age anyway?</h3><p> <br/> Well, while raising the FRA may appear to be a small or subtle change, it will likely result in a material reduction in ones total lifetime retirement benefits. Because the monthly payments a person receives grows larger the later in life one retires, raising the FRA reduces the total amount of money paid out. <br/> <br/> For example, if your FRA is age 66, each year that you delay the start of your benefits, your benefit payment is guaranteed to increase by 8% per year (plus any increases due to cost of living adjustments) up to age 70. That four year delay in the start of your benefits represents a 32% guaranteed increase in your benefits plus cost of living adjustments (COLA). In fact, by delaying the start of your benefits from age 62 (the earliest possible filing date) to age 70, your benefit amount will approximately double! <br/> <br/> <strong>  If the FRA is increased to say age 70, future retirees will get smaller payouts than previous ones did after starting to receive benefits at the very same age. </strong> For example, if your projected benefit at age 66 was $1,000/mo. and at age 70 it was $1,320/mo. then these benefits under an FRA of age 70 would be only $760/mo. at age 66 and $1,000/mo. at age 70. This effective reduction in benefits could significantly effect ones retirement income on both an annual basis as well as on a cumulative lifetime benefits basis. In addition, it's important to note that the effect of all future COLA's would also be reduced since the COLA's will be applied to lower benefit amounts. <br/> <br/> Would changing the FRA be the best approach to tackling the financial challenges affecting social security? What if the FRA was only increased to age 68 instead of age 69 or 70? What effect would that have in closing the budget gap? Apparently, increasing the FRA from age 67 to age 68 would only erase 12% of the deficit that social security is expected to face 75 years from now. Nevertheless, this type of change would still have a significant affect on the financial circumstances of lower and middle income earners in retirement. <br/> <br/> What if instead changes were made to the way social security taxes work? Currently, social security taxes are only applied to earnings up to $118,500. This is in contrast to Medicare taxes which apply to all earnings. What if social security taxes were also applied to all earned income as well? If that were to happen it is projected that it would reduce the expected deficit 75 years from now by 70%! This approach would also spare the lower and middle income earners from sharp reductions to their retirement benefits. <br/> <br/> Clearly, there are numerous alternatives available to addressing the financial challenges facing social security. The \"best\" approach will undoubtedly be hotly debated. Perhaps it will require a combination of changes in order to reach a political compromise. As the banter surrounding changes to social security benefits increases be sure to ask and get answers to exactly how these changes would affect your own benefits as these changes could have a significant affect on your retirement income for perhaps decades to come.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-08 18:33:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-08 18:33:00.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_FwGwwVV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/should-the-social-security-retirement-age-be-raised/\", \"post_id\": \"5954\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-08 18:33:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-08 18:33:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"should-the-social-security-retirement-age-be-raised\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5953\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2720\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-08-at-11.35.40-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"630\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441796400,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2655,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Do You Get After the Internet of Value?","link":"what-do-you-get-after-the-internet-of-value","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As mentioned last week, the new book is about the ValueWeb: the Internet of Value.  Amazingly, some people are already asking me what comes after the Internet of Value?</p><p> Let's begin with noting that your need the Internet of Value to allow the Internet of Things.  Machines cannot trade with machines if they don't have a real-time almost free value exchange system.  That real-time almost free system is the Internet of Value. </p><p> The Internet of Value allows the refrigerator to exchange value with the grocery store through a registration of the refrigerator on the owner&rsquo;s identity.  The owner will get cloud-based updates in real-time of the refrigerator&rsquo;s purchases.  They will also see what their car, television and other devices are ordering in real-time.  This will all run on a shared infrastructure, which is some form of an internet cloud-based shared ledger of trust. </p><p> As machines trade with machines, the Internet On-Demand for printing anything will develop.  This is development is hinged upon secure designs and patents, as it means the supply chain collapses from goods being imported from overseas to goods being printed at home or in the local workshop.  Right now, 3D printers can easily print anything from jewelry to clothing to guns to even printing houses and body parts.</p><br /><p> As people can print products at home that they used to purchase in stores, there will be a war on copyright crime and illegal printing of products.  This war will be the same battle we have seen with the illegal downloading of digital goods and services, like film and music, but now in the physical world of products from fashion to furniture.  After all, if you can just get a design and source the materials, you can start producing anything in your home.  That&rsquo;s the On-Demand internet future.</p><p> Shortly after this, we will have things looking after us.  There will be robots appearing to manage healthcare in particular.  After all, if we can print body parts, we can replace the parts that no longer function quickly and easily. Scientists are already solving many of the most insoluble challenges, thanks to crowdsourcing ideas through gamification.   A great example is the story of Foldit.</p><p> Foldit is a revolutionary crowdsourcing computer game enabling anyone to contribute to important scientific research.  The game analyses how proteins are generated and how they work, with the aim of finding solutions to diseases such as HIV/AIDS, various cancers, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and more.  The gaming system first came to light in 2011 when the players solved an AIDS puzzle in weeks that had baffled scientists for more than a decade.  People playing Foldit solved how an enzyme structure that causes an AIDS-like disease in monkeys worked in three weeks. Researchers had been working on the problem for 13 years.  There are other games that are trying to solve global challenges and health issues from finding new planets (Planet Hunters) to solving genetic diseases through DNA analysis (Phylo) to figuring out how the brain works (Eyewire).</p><p> The development of life sciences, further fuelled by crowdsourcing answers to life&rsquo;s problems, will lead to greater and greater longevity of life.  Already scientists are predicting that the average child born in 2015 will live to the year 2165 (150 years old) and that will only be made possible by leap-frogging our health challenges combined with assisting our healthcare.</p><p> This is where we expect to see robots appearing in the home at first: dispensing medicines at the right time through the day, every day, along with serving meals and managing the home.  We already home some examples of robots in the home &ndash; lawn mowers and vacuum cleaners &ndash; but robots generally assisting around the home of less abled and aging citizens will make sense, as does robo-parts.  The idea of the bionic human is also here.  Doctors are replacing arms and legs with robotic replacement parts that work well.</p><br /><p> Bionic arms, legs and eyes are now a realistic vision, as is replacing heart, lungs, kidneys and other internal organs.  Breakthroughs in managing cancers, strokes, heart attack and other life threatening illnesses are also being solved at a pace.  A little like our ability to explore space, land humans on Mars and see close-up images of Pluto, the things that were science fiction when we were growing up are becoming fact, and it&rsquo;s all down to the onward march of technology.</p><p> However, during the final phase of ValueWeb 3.0, the third generation internet of things, on-demand and robots, will not function without the underlying real-time and free value exchange mechanisms.  How can my homecare robot order my drugs, medicines and food if they are unable to pay?  How can my refrigerator, car and home entertainment system manage my life for me if they cannot order goods and services on my behalf?</p><p> All of these developments of machine-to-machine (M2M) commerce can only be created and delivered if you have a real-time almost free ValueWeb underpinning it all.  That is why this is so fundamental and, as illustrated, asking what comes after the Internet of Value is really asking what comes after the delivery of the Internet of Things, where we can print anything on-demand and robots are everywhere.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-08 18:40:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-08 18:40:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_NbEfLJL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-do-you-get-after-the-internet-of-value/\", \"post_id\": \"5956\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-08 18:40:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-08 18:40:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-do-you-get-after-the-internet-of-value\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5955\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2721\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-08-at-11.43.23-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"486\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441803600,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2656,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Ways Leaders Inadvertently Say, \"I Don't Trust You\"","link":"7-ways-leaders-inadvertently-say-i-dont-trust-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Far too many leaders and managers inadvertently do things every day that send the message they distrust even their best people. </strong></p><p> Sapping people&rsquo;s trust is de-motivating, and de-motivated people simply don&rsquo;t do their best work. I&rsquo;m not suggesting your role is to motivate your people, but it&rsquo;s critical NOT to de-motive them. Eliminating inadvertent behaviors that say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust you,&rdquo; is a no-cost, high-value way to increase the odds they will consistently do their best work.</p><p> That said, what may not be evident is what you&rsquo;re doing that&rsquo;s telegraphing mistrust or doubt. Below are seven areas for you to consider, and bite-sized coaching ideas on each one, taken from the pages of my experience as an executive coach with many leaders and organizations. I hope you find them helpful!</p><h3> 1. Hovering</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> Nitpicking, micro-editing, being hyper-vigilant about the details of their work, too frequent check ins, and telling, rather than asking, &ldquo;better&rdquo; ways to do what they are doing.</p><p> <strong>  Unintended message you send: </strong> I don&rsquo;t trust you to do your job on your own.</p><p> <strong>  Coaching bites: </strong> If there&rsquo;s an enduring performance problem, greater vigilance may be necessary. If not, and if you think you may be hovering, ask yourself the appropriate question, depending on your pattern: &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t micro-edit this, can it be good enough?&rdquo; / &ldquo;What would enable me to experiment with getting out of the details of X&rsquo;s work?&rdquo; / &ldquo;Can I add greater value by asking good questions, and provoking my people to come up with their own answers/solutions?&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Delegating the &ldquo;what&rdquo; AND the &ldquo;how&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> Saying, in effect, &ldquo;This is what I need, and here&rsquo;s how I need you to do it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You should / should&rsquo;ve done it this way.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Unintended message you send: </strong> I don&rsquo;t trust you to do our job your own way / to do your job the best way possible.</p><p> <strong>  Coaching bites: </strong> Telling them how to do their work is marginalizing, rather than maximizing, your people, which goes directly to your bottom line. If there&rsquo;s well-grounded concern about whether they will come up with a good solution, then you need either provide greater support, or reconsider the person for their role. If it&rsquo;s not, then having them figure out on their own the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of what you&rsquo;ve asked them to do makes them add value, and that&rsquo;s what you pay them to do.</p><h3> 3. Delegating without sufficient context</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> Making a request or command to do something without explaining why, or where it fits in to the bigger picture.</p><p> <strong>  Unintended message you send: </strong> You don&rsquo;t need to be in the loop of the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of this. I don&rsquo;t care enough about your success to actually increase the odds you will succeed here.</p><p> <strong>  Coaching bites: </strong> People do a much better job when they understand the context of your request&mdash;it&rsquo;s needed to tailor the thinking and output in a positive way. Before making a request, try thinking about including them in the bigger picture, OR explaining why they are NOT being given that context. Other things that add context include how their work will be used, why it is the priority it is, etc. Higher-context delegation, even if it takes another minute or two of thought on your part, will yield greater engagement and better output among your people.</p><h3> 4. Taking authority for decision-making too far up the chain</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> Many organizations say they want to empower their people, yet particularly in difficult times, the reverse is the tidal pull. Pulling too many decisions into committees, or up the leadership chain, making decisions on smaller issues or expenditures and not delegating them.</p><p> <strong>  Unintended message it sends: </strong> you don&rsquo;t trust people to make prudent or wise decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Coaching bite: </strong> This may be a blind spot issue. Consider asking your people&mdash;which decisions do they feel they can make, yet that are being made beyond or above them?</p><h3> 5. Leading with the mindset that your people are not allowed to fail</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> However well-intentioned, if people are working at their best, sometimes they will fall down, or fail. Intervening, over-rehearsing, or otherwise being heavy-handedly protective of them.</p><p> <strong>  Unintended message you send: </strong> I don&rsquo;t trust that you can handle yourself well.</p><p> <strong>  Coaching bites: </strong> While it&rsquo;s a good practice to help your people avoid falling a mile, falling an inch or even a foot, can be an important&mdash;irreplaceable&mdash;learning experience, one that makes them more self-sufficient, and one that you deprive them of if you are being too heavy-handed in their &ldquo;defense.&rdquo;</p><h3> 6. Overriding your people&rsquo;s input or feedback</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> Taking in input then (apparently to them) ignoring it without explanation. Asking for feedback, then overriding it.</p><p> <strong>  Unintended message you send: </strong> I don&rsquo;t trust the quality or insights of your input.</p><p> <strong>  Coaching bites: </strong> If you seek feedback or input, then choose to bypass or reject it, it&rsquo;s important to share what was behind your decision. &ldquo;You had good ideas, but we ran out of time / budget, and had to do the minimum,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I appreciated what you said, and hope we can take it to heart next time, but this time, X got in the way,&rdquo; can help. Otherwise, you risk shutting them up / shutting them down, particularly when the stakes are higher.</p><h3> 7. Keeping your people under wraps</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Behaviors: </strong> bringing your people along with you to an important presentation or moment, and not having them actively participate. Not giving your people opportunities to showcase their work.</p><p> <strong>  Unintended message you send: </strong> I don&rsquo;t trust you to do your best when the setting or stakes are higher.</p><p> <strong>  Coaching bites: </strong> Again, if you are worried about your people presenting or showcasing in higher-stakes settings, then it&rsquo;s important to address what&rsquo;s worrying you.

{"original_id":2658,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Sitting at Work is Killing You","link":"sitting-at-work-is-killing-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Getting up and moving is the key to survival. Multiple medical studies have confirmed that spending too much time sitting is wrecking our health. Office workers are losing the battle to live longer, and our sedentary lifestyle has become our own personal terminator.</p><p> The connection between sitting and poor health first broke in 2010, with an article in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/sitting-linked-early-death/story?id=11234721\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American Journal of Epidemiology  </a> </u> . Scientists studied 120,000 adults that sat more than six hours a day in their leisure time. Their conclusion was that these individuals were significantly more likely to die within a 14-year timespan than their colleagues who sat less and moved more.</p><p> In 2012, a study by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2012/03/28/standing-up-on-the-job-one-way-to-improve-your-health/\" target=\"_blank\">   University of Sydney&rsquo;s School of Public Health  </a> </u>  confirmed the findings &mdash; too much sitting creates metabolic changes that shorten your life.</p><p> The study also showed that when sedentary living extends from the office chair to the living room couch, there is even more troubling news. If you&rsquo;re skipping the gym visit after work (where you&rsquo;ve spent all day sitting) you have double the risk of dying within three years.</p><p> Just take a look at these shocking stats put together by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.diygenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/truth-about-sitting-down-infographic.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Medical Billing &amp; Coding  </a> </u> :</p><p> <img alt=\"infographic-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/infographic-1.jpg?t=1441404099802&amp;width=516\"/></p><h3> Everything in Moderation &ndash; Including Sitting</h3><p> <br/> The human body seems to be designed for a little of this and a little of that. Exercising moderation in most areas seems to provide us with a prescription for better health. Now take that prescription and apply it to how much most of us sit. Many office workers sit in front of the computer for eight hours, sit in our cars to go home, and then sit in front of the television or computer at night before bed.</p><p> But the human body has biologically progressed into a mobile machine. As hunter-gatherers, our bodies evolved to carry us miles as we searched for food and shelter. Studies have shown that when we sit too long, our metabolism changes, which produces more belly fat, the precursor to diabetes. Today we spend out entire lives in chairs, and not only are our bodies not suited for it; it&rsquo;s shortening our lives.</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/02/sitting-is-the-new-smoking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wired  </a> </u>  magazine article stated our sedentary lifestyle contributes:</p><li> 10% toward the risk of breast and colon cancer</li><li> 6% toward the risk of heart disease</li><li> 7% toward type 2 diabetes <br/>  </li><p> The good news is, we&rsquo;ve figured out the physical problems associated with too much butt-in-the-seat time. The American phenomenon of inactivity has even spawned a few new office products to aid you in your efforts to sit less and move more.</p><h3> New Office Equipment and Better Health</h3><p> <br/> One of the latest innovations for the office allows workers to stand up while at their desks. While standing desks may be considered a fad, their creation and design has been based on the scientific studies correlating health risks with sitting.</p><p> Interestingly, old-school thinkers like Thomas Jefferson and Charles Dickens adopted the standing desk while completing a considerable lifetime&rsquo;s worth of excellent work. With prices ranging up to $4,000, today&rsquo;s standing desk isn&rsquo;t the simple wooden affair favored by Jefferson. Ergonomic, with a variety of height settings, these desks really are a great way, literally, to take your work to a whole new level.</p><p> Speaking of taking it to a whole new level, consider a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.signaturetreadmilldesks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Signature Treadmill Desk  </a> </u> . Who needs to buy a gym membership or take the time to work out? Just head on over to the office!</p><h3> Change Your Life by Moving at the Office</h3><p> <br/> One of our favorite salespeople has a headset he uses when he&rsquo;s on calls. You can see him through the office window, standing and pacing and talking. While that&rsquo;s just his personal style, he&rsquo;s a good model for those of us that sit hunched over a computer screen all day.</p><p> The first benefit of moving while talking is that it burns more calories.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/05/ditch-your-office-chair-for-a-new-standing-desk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Studies  </a> </u>  have shown that the act of standing burns 40% more calories than sitting. Even the process of standing up from your desk chair helps your metabolism.</p><p> While we all tend to get a little immersed in our work, try setting a computer tickler to remind you to stand up every hour. That might even help you avoid the after-lunch &ldquo;blah&rdquo; effect, when all you really want to do is take a nap.</p><p> Remember that moderation is the key to health. This means that standing all day long may not be the best solution, either. A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/05/ditch-your-office-chair-for-a-new-standing-desk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cornell University  </a> </u>  study stated standing 8 to 10 hours per day could actually lead to varicose veins and an increased risk of constricted arteries.</p><p> With that said, some offices are even instigating &ldquo;moving meetings,&rdquo; which are conducted while taking a walk. Many offices have developed lunchtime workout classes that are free or low cost for employees. It&rsquo;s great incentive to get up and get moving. </p><p> Choosing to live a less sedentary lifestyle by making deliberate choices to stand more at your desk job is one easy way to control improvements to your health. The facts are simple: living longer means getting out of your chair. If this one simple change could prolong your life, isn&rsquo;t it worth making?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-08 19:20:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-08 19:20:14.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_VYkXq6Y.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/sitting-at-work-is-killing-you/\", \"post_id\": \"5964\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-08 19:20:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-08 19:20:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"sitting-at-work-is-killing-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5963\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2725\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-Desk-Guide-Say-No-To-Sitting-At-Work-All-Day_HEADER_982x552.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"591\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441810800,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

Writing social media posts, blog posts, emails, white papers and more can be incredibly time consuming, even confusing!</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2015_B2B_Research.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Marketing Institute  </a> </u>  reports that 28 percent of B2B marketing budgets go to content marketing efforts.</p><p> This makes sense when you think about it &ndash; companies handle multiple channels, all requiring different  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/how-to-determine-blog-post-length/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content lengths  </a> </u>  and styles, resulting in a content creation budget slowly taking over your marketing expenses. If you do it all, then costs can get out of control.</p><p> Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you create a piece of content, look at your current content assets. One white paper can form the foundation of an entire month&rsquo;s worth of inbound marketing content. Here&rsquo;s one way to break down your content library:</p><h3> 1 Infographic</h3><p> <br/> Is your white paper filled with pull quotes, statistics and other data relevant to your audience? Create a visually attractive infographic incorporating a distilled version of your white paper findings. Readers are more likely to share visual content across social media sites, increasing your chances of getting more viewership. The infographic can also illustrate a blog post.</p><h3> 3 Case Studies</h3><p> <br/> Did you reach out to others in your industry or existing customer pool to gather data for your white paper? Follow up with them to get additional information so you can spin the white paper into three or more case studies. Case studies are useful for companies who want to know more about real-life applications of your products or services.</p><h3> 5 Newsletter Articles</h3><p> <br/> Email marketing provides good reach to an interested audience, especially mobile-heavy readers. Create five short newsletter articles elaborating on topics from the white paper or using edited excerpts directly from the white paper to attract interest. You can send readers looking for the full white paper to an appropriate targeted landing page.</p><h3> 10 Blog Posts</h3><p> <br/> Many company blogs have frequent posting schedules &mdash; as much as 2-3 times per week &mdash; usually making them the single biggest drain on a content budget. However, instead of creating fresh blog material and becoming overwhelmed at the amount of ideas you or your content creation person has to generate, use the white paper to fuel a series. The blog posts can tackle a particular finding or white paper topic, giving it additional context and generating interest in the white paper.</p><h3> 20 Social Media Posts</h3><p> <br/> Social media posts are short, but the sheer number of posts you need for your social channels can mean big stress. Key pull quotes, especially those that are shareable or generate engagement from your audience, provide excellent repurposing possibilities.</p><p> Work smarter, not harder, at content creation by putting existing assets to work. Combine these content pieces with a well-organized editorial calendar to meet your audience&rsquo;s content needs for an entire month.</p><p> Pulling It All Together</p><p> By basing all of your content creation efforts on a single white paper, the different tactics you use will work together.  You&rsquo;ll generate more interest in your whitepaper and generate more leads as a result.

The group, a partnership of financial advisors, life insurance agents and life insurance companies, has launched a series of dramatic ads taking aim at proposed Department of Labor regulations.</p><p> In one clip, Parents wave goodbye as they deliver their daughter to college. The wife asks nervously &ldquo;How are we going to afford this?&rdquo; The conversation quickly segues into her concern that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s these new regulations in Washington that worry me. They want to make it really hard to get advice from our financial advisor.&rdquo;  The husband is aghast &ndash; &ldquo;No more help from Anne?!&rdquo; then later, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to call our senators.&rdquo; The spot closes urging Americans to call Congress and tell them to &ldquo;Fix This Now!&rdquo;</p><p> The proposed regulation sparking the theatrical outburst would require that sellers of annuities, life insurance, IRAs, 401(k) investments and other such retirement products be held to a fiduciary standard.  The Department of Labor opened a four-day public hearing regarding the matter on August 10th where it received heated comment.  Assistant Secretary Phyllis C. Borzi set the stage by noting that, &ldquo;[The DOL&rsquo;s] regulatory impact analysis concluded that IRA investors can expect to lose more than $210 billion over the next ten years as a result of the underperformance associated with conflicts of interest.&rdquo;1 She insisted the Department is not trying to penalize anyone for behaving badly, but is rather trying to change an outdated and structurally flawed system.</p><p> A key component of the current proposal would require more retirement investment advisers to put their client&rsquo;s best interest first, specifically as it relates to rollovers from an employer-based plan to an IRA. This focus falls in step with both the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) who targeted IRA Rollover Practices in their examination priorities for 2014. Additionally, in June 2015, the SEC launched a multi-year industry review and examination initiative, the Retirement Targeted Industry Reviews and Examinations Initiative (ReTIRE).</p><p> As the focus continues to sharpen and debates heat up, the following fundamentals, as identified by the SEC as focus areas of the ReTIRE examination initiative, should be kept top of mind as your firm services retiring and senior clients, especially when recommending rollovers of retirement assets:</p><li> <strong>  Document the basis for recommendations. </strong> This documentation should demonstrate that your firm considered its obligations to clients when (i) selecting the type of account; (ii) performing due diligence on investment options; (iii) making initial investment recommendations; and (iv) providing ongoing management.</li><li> <strong>  Review and address conflicts of interest. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t overlook conflicts that may be inherent in your firm&rsquo;s compensation structure, business structure, and personal or service provider relationships.  Your firm&rsquo;s compliance program should be designed to address the risks associated with the identified conflicts, and to disclose the material conflicts when they cannot be eliminated.</li><li> <strong>  Supervise your representatives and review their sales practices.  </strong> Review your firm&rsquo;s compliance and oversight program.  This program should be tailored to your firm&rsquo;s specific business, and it is critical that your firm be in compliance with the policies and procedures it has adopted.  Firms with multiple business locations and those with reps who have outside business activities will be a particular focus for the SEC.</li><li> <strong>  Verify that communications with the public are fair and balanced.  </strong> Ensure marketing and advertising is not deceptive or misleading and that materials and posts are true, accurate, and do not omit material information.  Confirm that fee disclosures are clear and complete. Finally, ensure that any professional credentials used are valid and meet stipulated standards. <br/>  </li><p> With 10,000 Baby Boomers projected to retire each day in America through the year 2019, the saga is far from over.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-08 19:55:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-08 19:55:11.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_LfHA2gc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-fiduciary-standard-hits-your-living-room/\", \"post_id\": \"5970\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-08 19:55:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-08 19:55:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-fiduciary-standard-hits-your-living-room\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5969\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2728\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/stairs-home-loft-lifestyle-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"408\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441818000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

At one point she worked as a bus conductor on one of those iconic red double-decker buses. At other times she worked as a cleaning person, and later as a shop clerk and shop manager. In short, she took on whatever work she could to keep food on the table.

We secured a full page in one of the major financial newspapers and we wrote a multi-hundred word piece on our views, on our response, and how investors might also respond. There was no &lsquo;white space&rsquo;, just words.

{"original_id":2664,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Think Big, Act Bigger","link":"think-big-act-bigger","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Has anyone ever told you, or have you thought to yourself, that maybe you are not setting your sights high enough? The problem with that is that there will always be someone who is selling more, making more, or just being more impactful. I just read the new book by Jeffrey Hayzlett called, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599185741/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1599185741&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=redzonemarket-20&amp;linkId=YXNGXINQSON6ZYMN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Think Big, Act Bigger  </a> </u> &rdquo; and I was surprisingly inspired by his take on how we can push ourselves to higher levels.</p><h3> Here are my favorite 3 takeaways:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Be a little irrational: </strong> According to the many famous executives that have shared their stories in the book, being sane and rational does not get you to a big goal. Sometimes you have to be far out there to pull people along to where you want them to go. It is called irrational leadership, and it creates necessary tension and results. Keeping the status quo is obviously not thinking big. I love it!</p><p> <strong>  2. Kill the squirrel: </strong> Yes, it is about focusing on what is important. The distractions are the demise of getting bigger. Why are we doing the things we are doing day in and day out? Unless our activities are truly focused, there is no way we can efficiently get bigger (and perhaps never get bigger, period). In the book, Hayzlett shares a simple inverted triangle system to help with organizing tasks. One of the biggest issues in business today is that there is too much to do in a finite amount of time. And when we spend time on tasks at the expense of our growth, it is infinitely unfair to everyone. We have to get control of our time, and focus our efforts. The inverted triangle system is logical, visual, and an easy method that you can follow daily. A certain level of distractedness is common among business owners with so much on their plates, but it can get to a point where it is hindering your growth.</p><p> <strong>  3. Fear of failure is at the heart of failure: </strong> &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t step out, I can&rsquo;t fail.&rdquo; We all know this intuitively, but as Hayzlett says, when no one is willing to act, no one fails, but no one wins either.

Saving for their children&rsquo;s education and retirement at the same time will likely be more challenging in the years to come.</p><h3> How Much will the Cost of Higher Education be in the Future?</h3><p> <br/> The cost of higher education will depend on where a family lives and the number of children they have who are planning to attend college or university. Here are some facts to keep in mind when thinking about education costs:</p><li> In a case where there is only one child, this amount may be something that can be realistically included in a family budget. For families with three children, $420.00 per month for education savings may be a bit out of reach. At this level, parents may not be able to pay for an education savings plan and their own retirement.</li><li> Part of the answer will also depend on where they live. In British Columbia, where families are strapped with mortgage payments and probably need two incomes just to stay afloat, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of room left for savings.</li><li> Education is definitely where grandparents can make a financial impact in the lives of their children and grand children. Grandparents often have more disposable income than their children and so if you can afford it, and especially if you are already give cash gifts to your grandkids, why not invest it for their future instead? Education is the best gift you can give! <br/>  </li><h3> Tips for Saving for Grandchild&rsquo;s Education <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  ​​Start early </strong> (ideally when the grandchild is born) and take advantage of government grants to help top up the amount in the plan. The power of tax-free compound interest can also help the money grow.</li><li> <strong>  Contribute those cash gifts you were planning to give on birthdays and Christmas to an RESP </strong> (Registered Education Savings Plan) instead.Use a Family Plan RESP, which can have several children in the family as beneficiaries. If one child doesn&rsquo;t end up furthering their education, his or her siblings can use the money in the plan instead. A course lasting at least three weeks, with 10 hours or more of instruction per week can qualify under government eligibility rules, which means that grandchildren are not limited only using the money to fund diploma or degree programs .</li><li> <strong>  Discuss your expectations about educational costs with your grandchildren. </strong> Let your grandkids know from an early age that you expect them to pay for part of the cost of school. A certain amount of part-time or summer employment earnings should be put into a savings account for this purpose.</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-09 16:59:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-09 16:59:35.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_kjqxVPU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/cost-of-higher-education-how-grandparents-can-help-grandkids-pay-for-school/\", \"post_id\": \"5978\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-09 16:59:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-09 16:59:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"cost-of-higher-education-how-grandparents-can-help-grandkids-pay-for-school\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5977\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2732\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-09-at-10.02.30-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"547\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441885500,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2666,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Living out Loud in the 21st Century: Why We Are Never Alone","link":"living-out-loud-in-the-21st-century-why-we-are-never-alone","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I was recently invited to be a mentor at a speed mentoring event in the Silicon Valley. I was curious to experience this 7-minute random sharing. I wondered how it would work and I was a bit apprehensive since I like listening and understanding problems and needs before sharing ideas and suggestions to people I don&rsquo;t know. But I decided to be adventurous and found myself sitting at a table with a big number sign 7 so people can identify the mentors they wanted to talk to. <strong>  My profile shared that I am a futurist looking at the future of life and work and that I formerly was a senior executive working around the globe in technology. </strong> My passion for building communities and new ways of working was also showcased.</p><p> The bell rang and we were off to the races. One by one, each person sat down and wanted a quick fix solution to whatever problem they wanted to share. Many wanted to know how to leave their exhausting corporate jobs and get a life that could be financially supported. Some saw that I have been building communities my whole life and wanted to know how to find their tribe. Others I simply want to forget, as I think they thought we were in a therapy session; something I am not qualified to help with.</p><p> It was an interesting evening as each person sat down and I tried to prod and understand their issue so I could add value and be helpful. Each time, I felt we were just starting to make a dent, the bell rang and the next person sat down. And the cycle started all over. I wondered how many would follow up beyond the event and see this as an opportunity to build relationships by sparking conversations.</p><p> On my drive home, I had a lot of time to reflect about the evening.  I was grateful I never went to a speed dating event as I felt that this was a quick fix event or maybe they needed more mentors who were tactical and can give quick fixes. I am not in the quick fix business as I don&rsquo;t believe it is sustainable. This was simply an experiment and more research for my lifework.</p><h3> Confessions of A Speed Mentor</h3><p> <br/> We need to spend time understanding why we have an issue, what it means and only then, how can we approach it. We have been conditioned to a world of sameness and quite frankly, it is almost impossible to implement other people&rsquo;s solutions without understanding our core issues and also knowing ourselves and our organizations. We run from conference to conference; from expert to expert; and we don&rsquo;t spend enough time to go deep and build our own pathways. Our job is to first understand our purpose and ask for help in defining it. There is no generic right or wrong. There is what works for each of us and stories of others that we may learn from.</p><p> While rank is synonymous with the military and C-level is synonymous with corporations, hierarchy and startups go together like oil and water. In a startup, titles aren&rsquo;t used as an outlet for ego boosting.</p><p> This is an amazing time to be alive as you don&rsquo;t need to go to an event to meet people all over the world. Unfortunately, the social networks we have today are not as social as we need but the world is open and connected. You can find people easily based on interests and all that is needed is courage to connect to them. I recently received a LinkedIn invite from a woman I did not know in Ghana who wanted to talk to me about a conference her organization was putting together in the fall. I accepted her invite and we jumped on a Skype call.</p><p> Esther shared with me that they are planning to bring youth and women together to prepare them to be better leaders. We spent the rest of the conversation discussing why they don&rsquo;t need to bring an Israeli-Canadian-American to Ghana to tell the youth about leadership, even though I have worked extensively in Africa. I provided her with ideas on how they can tap into their local leaders and showcase them as the future of the country, which I am pleased to say they have. I asked questions and also suggested she tap into the local businesses and create unusual partnership. And finally, I shared that she should show the youth what is possible by sharing how she had the courage to reach out to someone she didn&rsquo;t know and spark a conversation via LinkedIn. It is open and available to everyone. There is no barrier to entry apart for a device, connectivity, literacy and electrical power. The world is small and getting smaller every day. Esther continues to communicate with me and give me updates on how many local youth are attending and how the event has been localized. We both hope that we will meet in Ghana when I can come speak on a more global topic and meet the youth and women. I admire Esther for having the courage to create a local event that will meet why they are running it on the firsthand.</p><p> Not one person from the speed mentoring event continued the conversation, apart from sending me a LinkedIn invite. It was a missed opportunity and I checked with other mentors, this was not happening. It is one of the biggest problems we have at work today. We run from meeting to meeting, from event to event, and we don&rsquo;t have deep conversations. I often wonder what work actually means in the 21st century. Is it doing our email? Is it sitting in endless meetings watching slides fly one by one on screens? or is it going to meetings and doing our email? How many people in your organization work around a shared purpose?</p><p> The world is open and connected. Today, we can easily reach out to other people and we need to leave behind our 20th century antiquated practices. There are no quick fixes and there is an increasing human need to connect with other people, even if it is just to share our stories and have someone else listen. Community, relationships and trust are becoming more critical to business today, despite being labelled as &ldquo;soft&rdquo; skills. They are what is needed. We need more people who live and work out loud and know how to co-create outside of organizational silos.</p><h3> Call to Action</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;d like to ask you to join me and live out loud in the 21st century. Because if you will, you will find that you will never be alone or isolated again. You will easily build a community of like-minded people but it will take some thought and effort to create it in a world where the platforms we have are abundant but do not serve our human need to connect on purpose.</p><p> And if you don&rsquo;t know what living or working out loud means, please ask me as I will be happy to share.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-09 17:13:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-09 17:13:53.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_wIsjjyA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/living-out-loud-in-the-21st-century-why-we-are-never-alone/\", \"post_id\": \"5980\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-09 17:13:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-09 17:13:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"living-out-loud-in-the-21st-century-why-we-are-never-alone\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5979\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2733\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-09-at-10.16.40-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"411\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441905300,"author_id":48,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s Hubspot&rsquo;s Inbound 2015 conference and I&rsquo;m in Boston to drink the marketing Kool-Aid. With keynote speakers including Seth Godin and Bren&eacute; Brown, high on my agenda is zeroing in on best practice marketing automation for financial services. It&rsquo;s all about choosing the right tools and technology to do the work for you.</p><p> For those who missed the Tim Ferriss classic, &lsquo;The 4 Hour Work Week&rsquo; (now celebrating its 10th anniversary), then it&rsquo;s time to catch up. It showed us how working smarter, not harder, was the path to finding time to do the things you love. And right alongside Ferriss, offering mentorship and support for the concept all the way, was Hubspot&rsquo;s keynote speaker, bestselling author and all round revolutionary thinker, Seth Godin.</p><p> Hearing from Seth will be a highlight of the Conference, and we&rsquo;ll be reporting in more detail following his session and of course, keeping you abreast via Twitter during. Follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlueChip_Comm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   BlueChip_Comm  </u> </a> to get real time insight.</p><p> Which brings us back to marketing automation and living the four hour marketing dream. For financial services marketers it can deliver more sales-ready leads so you can do less to earn more and meet (or exceed!) those revenue targets.</p><h3> Automation works</h3><p> <br/> Hubspot&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/53/file-2325837932-pdf/Corporate_Content/Demand-Gen-Benchmarks-Report-Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Demand Generation Benchmark&rsquo;s Report  </a> </u>  found &ldquo;companies exceeding their revenue goals generate significantly more website visits, leads, MQLs (marketing qualified leads), sales opportunities, and customers than those that don&rsquo;t. Attracting the right type of traffic to your website and generating the right type of leads is important, as is nurturing those leads to become MQLs, opportunities, and eventually customers&rdquo;.</p><p> The rise and rise of search</p><p> So why am I so fired up about marketing automation and how can you use it to be the financial services marketing rock star?</p><p> Search has changed how customers find, engage and make decisions about the companies from which they choose to buy. In the typical B2B path to purchase,  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/11414/12-Mind-Blowing-Statistics-Every-Marketer-Should-Know.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   potential customers are already 78% through their decision making before reaching out  </a> </u> . This makes them hungry for information during their research phase, hence the rise of content marketing as a powerful tool.</p><p> So we create useful content, exchange their email for our content and we&rsquo;re done. The sales team can give them a call, right? Wrong.</p><h3> Scaling up</h3><p> Just 27% of B2B leads are sales ready when they first divulge their contact details (Marketing Sherpa). It&rsquo;s like meeting a hot potential date at a bar and immediately inviting them home to meet Mum and Dad. It&rsquo;s jarring to go from one download to fielding sales materials or calls, just as it would be crazy to go from flirting over a cocktail to question time with the parents. We all need time to develop a relationship.</p><p> Marketing automation allows you to nurture your potential &lsquo;dates&rsquo; at scale, to build those relationships in a way that makes sense to your prospects. You&rsquo;re looking to deliver the right information at the right time. And from a business perspective, you want to nurture your leads from initial suspect to purchase-ready prospect. The best part, and Godin would love this, is that once you&rsquo;ve set up your automation rules, you can sit back and watch the leads qualify themselves!</p><p> Here&rsquo;s where to start your journey as the four-hour marketer:</p><h3> 1. Dynamic content</h3><p> <br/> Initially keep it simple by tailoring your messaging around your content to your customer segments. For example, if your whitepaper is useful to both financial advisers and SMSF trustees, customise the call to action for a whitepaper download by speaking directly to the two segments in your targeted communications (think different emails and different content download landing pages for each segment). This alone can increase click through rates by 62% according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/effects-of-list-segmentation-on-email-marketing-stats/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mailchimp  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 2. Drip campaigns</h3><p> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve captured an email, don&rsquo;t stop the conversation. Simpler to set up than the full nurture campaign (see next point), drip campaigns are a series of pre-written emails that provide your prospects with further relevant information, introduce them to your organisation and educate them about their topic of interest (a.k.a. building your organisation&rsquo;s reputation in the prospect&rsquo;s mind as the expert).</p><p> These emails are pre-scheduled and must be sent in a timely manner. Ideally, you want to include a test for the prospect that alerts you to their sales readiness (and your marketing automation platform should have a lead scoring feature that&rsquo;s well suited for this purpose). This test could be a special introductory offer or pricing sheet download that demonstrates they&rsquo;ve moved from research towards purchase intent (who downloads pricing unless they&rsquo;re pretty ready to buy?!).</p><h3> 3. Nurture campaigns</h3><p> <br/> While the drip campaign is more &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo;, your nurture campaign allows for different prospects&rsquo; paths to purchase. Nurture campaigns take longer to map out and set up. They will pull dynamic information from your database and segment your prospects based on how they interact with your communications. Your automation software will send them in different directions based on their interests for a very personalised (yet automated) experience. Nice!

The law calls this type of rejection a &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/disclaimer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   disclaimer  </a> </u> &rdquo; or &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/renunciation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   renunciation  </a> </u> &rdquo;&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a very important  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate planning  </a> </u>  tool to consider whether you are  <u>  <a href=\"http://estate.findlaw.com/estate-administration/estate-administration.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   administering  </a> </u>  or are the beneficiary of an estate.First, let&rsquo;s consider why someone would  <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/disclaimers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  renounce a gift </a> . For some people, it is simply a personal preference&mdash;for one reason or another, they do not want to benefit from the estate of the  <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/decedent\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  decedent </a> . Far more common though, are situations where the intended beneficiary has substantial financial obligations, or is in a position where any inherited property would be at great risk.For example, imagine your great-aunt named you as a beneficiary in her will and then she unfortunately passed away right on the same day you learned that a  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collectionagency.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  collection agency </a>  is hounding you for tens of thousands of dollars. In a situation like this, you might expect to be bankrupt within a couple of months. If you accept the  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bequest.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  bequest </a>  from your great-aunt, all or a portion of it may be consumed by your creditors. That&rsquo;s probably not what your great-aunt would have wanted, so you can renounce the gift, have it go back to the estate and then be paid out to the other beneficiaries.Most bequests can be renounced, assuming the following criteria are met. The renunciation must:</p><li> Be formally made in writing to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   executor  </a> </u>  or administrator</li><li> Identify exactly what property is being disclaimed (for real estate, you must also identify the municipality, block, lot and precise interest of the beneficiary)</li><li> Be made within a specific time period</li>There are some situations where renunciation is not available. The most common situation is one where the beneficiary has already acted in some way to &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/encumber\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  encumber </a></u>&rdquo; the bequest.For example, if you borrowed money from someone and the loan was made based on the fact that you were expecting to receive a bequest from your great-aunt (which would be used to pay back the loan), you cannot then renounce the bequest. You are barred by <u> <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/statute\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  statute </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"/category/solutions/life-transitions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  common law </a></u> from renouncing because doing so would be <u> <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/inequitable\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  inequitable </a></u> to the lender.Sometimes the beneficiaries of an estate are asked to &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/waiver\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  waive </a></u>&rdquo; their rights to renounce (aka disclaim) bequests. When this happens, the beneficiaries are asked to sign a formal written document that bars them from exercising the right to disclaim in the future. This is common when real property in the estate has been left to multiple beneficiaries or if the beneficiaries are attempting to obtain <u> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financing </a></u> based in whole or in part on an expected inheritance.One important final issue to consider is the tax consequences of accepting or renouncing a bequest. In some instances, the <u> <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">  IRS </a></u> will not honor a renunciation, and thus it is important to obtain the advice of a qualified estate or tax attorney prior to making any decisions about renunciation.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-09 18:09:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-09 18:09:54.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_tBTJCuv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/looking-a-gift-horse-in-the-mouth-renouncing-a-bequest/\", \"post_id\": \"5984\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-09 18:09:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-09 18:09:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"looking-a-gift-horse-in-the-mouth-renouncing-a-bequest\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5983\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2735\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-09-at-11.12.35-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"762\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441900800,"author_id":11,"chart_url":""}

The poetry of a sport well executed stirs my soul.</p><p> Infinite lessons as I watch athletes who excel at what they do. Business lessons. Life lessons. Two factors, in particular, define the athletic edge.</p><h3> A Mastery Mindset</h3><p> <br/> Athletes train and train and train. Most start with a healthy dose of natural ability, but athletes work harder at their trade than the rest of us do. This commitment to personal mastery, to intentional practice and incremental improvement, is their differentiator. Most of us reach a plateau, often a fine one, and coast.</p><p> I have a mastery mindset when it comes to physical exercise, thanks to my trainer. I have it when it comes to writing, thanks to my study with a troika of writing luminaries and editors who elevate what I turn in. In most other parts of my life I coast. Sometimes great fun. It does not yield the rewards of mastery.</p><h3> A Coaching Mindset</h3><p> <br/> Athletes avail themselves of a coach. Since Serena hired French tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou, her performance has reached new heights, at an age when many tennis players have peaked. Joachim Loew, the coach of Germany&rsquo;s National Soccer Team, took a group of largely rookie soccer players and molded it into a World Championship Team.</p><p> A coach provides rigor and accountability. A coach strengthens an athlete&rsquo;s assets and hones the skills. A coach charts a clear execution strategy. A coach provides clear mental focus.</p><h3> Athletes know better than to work without one.</h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t wish to win any Grand Slams. Don&rsquo;t need to excel at everything. But here are my rewards when I work with an athletic mindset.</p><li> When I experience a sense of mastery, I get more joy out of the task I perform. I savor the increased ease with which I get things done. I relish the sense of making progress. I taste the poetry.</li><li> When I chart my professional path with a coach, I stay more conscious of everything I do. I am prone to take more risks. I discover more about myself. I taste the poetry.</li><p> Like an athlete, I stay resilient when things don&rsquo;t go my way. I play the game of life knowing that mastery hasn&rsquo;t slipped away because I have a bad day.</p><h3> Athletes know.</h3><p> <br/> You may not feel the need to master anything. You may not have a coach.</p><p> Embrace the mindset, anyway.</p><p> It sweetens the ride. It shows you the edge.</p><p> That&rsquo;s a good thing no matter how you roll the dice.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-09 18:13:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-09 18:13:07.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_granjcW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/athletes-know-better-than-to-work-without-one/\", \"post_id\": \"5986\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-09 18:13:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-09 18:13:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"athletes-know-better-than-to-work-without-one\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5985\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2736\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-09-at-11.20.49-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"628\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441908000,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}

Moments like these will never be among the most pleasant experiences of your professional life. Your boss may well spit the dummy and its very unlikely they will thank you graciously for bringing this to their attention.But it is possible to deliver bad news to your boss with some degree of aplomb &ndash; without dissolving into a pool of weeping, caterwauling sludge. Don&rsquo;t laugh. I have done this.So the next time you&rsquo;re the bearer of bad news, put your big girl or big boy pants on and do the following:<strong> 1. Front up, fess up and don&rsquo;t fall prey to procrastination.</strong> I&rsquo;ve spoken about this before <u> here</u>, but it bears repeating. If you wanna put your head in the sand and make like an ostrich, this is your cue to do the opposite.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=If+you+wanna+put+your+head+in+the+sand+and+make+like+an+ostrich%2C+this+is+your+cue+to+do+the...&amp;via=suzimcalpine&amp;related=suzimcalpine&amp;url=http://www.mcalpinecoaching.org/how-to-deliver-bad-news-to-your-boss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  If you wanna put your head in the sand and make like an ostrich, this is your cue to do the&hellip; </u></a>Delaying the inevitable merely delays the torture. And lemme tell you &ndash; it will be less pretty if they find out from someone else.BUT.<strong> 2. Do take some time to plan your communication and your potential solutions to &lsquo;said pickle&rsquo;.</strong>Make sure you&rsquo;ve put some thought into the following:&ndash; What exactly is the problem? Get it crisp, concise. Outline the impacts and implications. Positioning the problem concisely and effectively helps you frame-up the conversation.&ndash; When is the best time to deliver this? Grabbing her as she&rsquo;s about to go into a high-stress customer meeting, or just before the Board meeting, or even as she dashes out the door to the airport might not be the best timing. Giving thought to time of day and place might seem like an obvious thing, but it&rsquo;s often overlooked.&ndash; Considering how you can give them a &lsquo;pre-warning&rsquo; or heads-up might be a clever approach. One of my most talented team members in Executive Search would give me a heads up via a short email. From this, I was able to glean it wasn&rsquo;t great news, which helped me prepare myself. It meant I wasn&rsquo;t blindsided and could be more emotionally ready to receive the bad news.<strong> 3. Choose your timing and method of communication.</strong> See <u> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QVNQhIhNhJk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a></u> for a clever short video on choosing the comms that your customer (or in this case boss) prefers.<strong> 4. Fall on your sword.</strong> Take accountability. Accepting responsibility is a crucial part of the equation.<strong> 5. Prepare and discuss.</strong> Potential solutions, the implications of each, the risks, the benefits and next steps. And always aim for at least three possible solutions.

You&rsquo;re a boss.</strong> Put yourself in their shoes and ask, &ldquo;if one of my direct reports had to tell me some bad news, how would I want them to approach and handle it?&rdquo; This will offer up some ideas.<strong> 7. Put it in perspective.</strong> This one is more for you to remember when you are contemplating running off to Costa Rica to join a commune in the jungle. I know there have been professional occurrences in my life which at the time I thought would be my career death knell (I am prone to being slightly drama-queenish).

{"original_id":2671,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Should an Advisor Move During Volatile Times?","link":"should-an-advisor-move-during-volatile-times","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Letting fear govern your future is likely to result in a destiny you&rsquo;re not happy with.</h3><p> <br/> Volatility , according to Merriam-Webster, is defined as something that is  &ldquo;likely to change in a very sudden or extreme way.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s certainly an appropriate descriptor for the activity the world stock markets experienced through August and the start of September. With these vast market swings, we have been asked time and again if it has had, or will have, a negative impact on financial advisor movement. To that, we respond with a resounding &ldquo;NO.&rdquo;</p><p> While the market&rsquo;s gyrations certainly come up in conversations with advisors who are considering a move, most often it is just an afterthought. Just like financial advisors counsel their clients not to let fear govern their decision making process, we guide advisors in the same fashion.</p><p> Market volatility is just a natural corollary to market investment. It should not determine an advisor&rsquo;s future particularly if he has deep client relationships, as well as confidence that he always puts his clients&rsquo; best interests first. Advisors who are unhappy or unfulfilled at their current firm shouldn't use the current climate as an excuse to let fear stop them from doing what they believe is ultimately right.</p><p> Similarly, advisors shouldn&rsquo;t let a temperamental stock market be the sole determinant for jumping to another firm. For example, in the worst days of 2008 and 2009 many advisors who watched their assets under management become eviscerated over a matter of weeks &ndash; while their personal portfolios plummeted &ndash; made the decision to change firms simply to take advantage of high water transition deals; a wealth replacement strategy, of sorts.

Don&rsquo;t feel as if you are held hostage by market conditions.

Consider completing a fee audit on your best client&rsquo;s portfolio. Over the last five years, look at the total amount of fees they paid and look at the tangible (dollar gains, tax planning gains, estate planning gains, advice gains) benefits they received. Then list the intangible benefits they receive by your advice such as piece of mind, comfort, simplicity and trust. This can also be done through feedback questions with your top clients (discussed in an earlier post).This is part of your detailed process to outline your measurable and immeasurable client benefits. I always ask advisors &ldquo;Tell me how much income tax you potentially saved last year with your top client?&rdquo; I have yet to have an answer to that question. Are you telling me that you cannot quantify your value in dollar terms? Build a process that gives your clients and prospects a forward based, five year estimated cost and potential benefits to help you quantify value of your advice.  <strong>  Build your process with feedback, value and transparency to get an edge on the client experience. </strong></p><p> Now when you sit down with prospects consider this exercise and discussion. Ask &ldquo;Can I do a fee audit for you to help you understand how fees impact your planning?&ldquo; Look at the estimated total fees over the last five years that they have paid and in the last 12 months and quantify them in a dollar cost. Then look at the starting investment amount five years ago and the ending investment amount today, including withdrawals. Then ask about their planning processes they have completed, including tax planning, estate planning and financial planning and ask to see the documents. This exercise will help you with your value discussion, but more importantly, showing prospects the total cost and help them understand the total costs in dollar terms. It will also show complete transparency with benefits and will show your prospect instant and tangible benefits of working with you, especially if their current advisor has no process for showing their planning processes, total fees and total transparency, if they show any fees for advice. It will also allow you to discuss your value of your planning processes and your progress update meetings to keep them on track. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Prospecting discussion </strong> <br/> <br/> Get in a habit of people you come across every day if they understand the fees they are paying. Ask them to explain the fees as they understand it. Then ask \"would you be open for me to do a fee audit for the last five years to help you understand the cost (or fees) and benefits? I ask because, we do this for our clients so they understand the measurable benefits of our advice along with our immeasurable benefits that our planning offers such as piece of mind, simplicity of their financial life. Our clients appreciate more comprehensive planning advice through our progress update meetings 3 times per year, a 100 point planning checklist, tax planning, estate planning, financial planning and investment planning (what services you offer) in writing, does this make sense to you? Our clients have comfort knowing it is taken care of, so they can go on and enjoy the things that are important to them.&rdquo; Now you have the start of a process to discuss your differences with prospects. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Practice makes perfect </strong> <br/> <br/> Do you have scripts that you use with prospects and practice them with someone to give you feedback? Do you have a clear detailed process for making your client&rsquo;s fee ready? If not, who is helping you who has a proven process to help you get there? Find someone who has a proven process and has the time to help you get there. It is not just about content, but it is about practice. Who is helping you practice your scripts? Do you record your practice sessions? Imagine if the &ldquo;Rolling Stones&rdquo; band never practiced and only recorded once? Do you record your meetings with your client&rsquo;s permission? Find a coach, mentor or manager who can help you build your process and help you practice your communication skills to articulate your value.

Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> In many ways, it has never been a better time for financial marketing.</p><p> After a shaky number of years, overall optimism is gathering at pace, with investment in marketing and IT on the rise, and reaching new customers being considered a primary objective (a survey record high, in fact) according to the  <a href=\"http://www.pwc.co.uk/financial-services/publications/cbi-pwc-survey.jhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  latest CBI/ PwC Financial Services Survey </a> . Add to that the raft of new technologies and tools available for communicating and gathering customer insight and the future looks very bright for marketing teams.</p><p> But is it all plain sailing? Well, it rarely is, is it? Financial services marketers are faced with a complex network of challenges mixed in with the exciting opportunities of growing their customer base.  They are tasked with engaging people that increasingly demand transparency, improved communication and greater access to the people and brand behind the product or service. In addition, marketers need to get to grips with the multiplicity of responsibilities, new technologies and channels at lightning speed. And all the while being under increased pressure to prove the commercial value of marketing initiatives. Traditional marketing routes are increasingly out of date. A transformation is afoot.</p><p> Last year, taking the idea of creative transformation - the evolving relationship between creativity, digital, marketing and business &ndash; Dog produced a whitepaper that sought to uncover challenges faced by those involved in driving innovative marketing strategies and searched for actionable recommendations for today&rsquo;s marketers working within the financial services industry. Together with the notion that technology has transformed marketing enabling far more effective communications, challenges of language, boardroom engagement, silo mentality and lack of strong brand proposition identified in the whitepaper continue to resonate. The challenges outlined are those that must be overcome if opportunities afforded by increased investment and optimism are to be seized.</p><p> So how can marketers make the most of the reported opportunities to help their companies thrive? Well, we&rsquo;ve come up with four key recommendations for financial services marketers.</p><h3> Be People Centric.</h3><p> <br/> Be the customer hero. Focus on their experience, and explore their decision making processes prior to `becoming a customer. Marketers must be aware of and understand each and every interaction a customer has with the business across all channels, on and offline. Strive to make each stage of the decision making process easier, more intuitive, interactive, and even enjoyable for new customers, and focus on developing meaningful connections with customers at each relevant touch point. </p><p> Everything is marketing, from printed materials, website content, mobile app, micro UX, film, advert, email, phone call or tweet. Marketers must review each interaction, analysing experience through the eyes of the customer, and the impact to the business.</p><p> A quick note on content. Content used in communicating with customers should be made for the customer. Rather than thinking about the message the organisation wants to push, think about what the customer wants or needs to hear. Do they need advice? Do they want to get to know the person actually dealing with their financial interests? Do they want to know how an organisation deals with changes in the market? Ask questions and work from the customer viewpoint. Our Head of Creative, Adrian, wrote a piece on creative content  <a href=\"http://www.dogdigital.com/editorial/content-creation-versus-creative-content\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> , so please check it out. Suffice to say here, however, make sure the content marketing strategy is centred on the customer, not the organisation.</p><p> Marketers are the voice of the customer and the market in the boardroom. They must be the customer champion and remain the expert in both. As we identified in our own whitepaper, supported by Econsultancy&rsquo;s  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/65744-four-key-trends-from-our-value-of-marketing-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Value of Marketing  </u>    </a> report, there is an issue with language used within the boardroom. And a major challenge uncovered is that of the language used by marketers in communicating strategies effectively to those who mainly understand performance in terms of business and sales. To overcome this obstacle &ndash; and gain necessary buy in from those who hold the purse strings &ndash; marketers must: Consistently link marketing initiatives to the customer and market behaviour, demonstrating the need for innovation and activity in key areas; relentlessly communicate objectives in terms of outcomes, business impact, customer acquisition and retention; and illustrate the role marketing activation plays in the customer lifecycle and market differentiation. By putting customers at the centre of the marketing strategy and demonstrating a granular understanding of their experience and behaviour, the business and the market landscape, in addition to steering away from fluffy marketing terms, marketers will be in a stronger position to gain buy in for, and drive marketing strategies that help organisations thrive.</p><h3> Develop Rock Solid Strategies.</h3><p> <br/> By &lsquo;rock solid,&rsquo; we do not mean a concrete, unwavering set of activations with set-in-stone outputs. Of course, the strategy should be agile in terms of being adaptable to customer behaviour, responsive to market changes and flexible enough to explore appropriate technical innovation or media. However it needs to be &lsquo;rock solid&rsquo; in terms of focus. Far from being a paper exercise, or languishing exclusively with the marketing department, the strategy is a necessary plan, aligned to business strategy and integrated with sales, that holds a clear vision and roadmap of activity that will deliver a number of defined outcomes. </p><p> As marketers, define what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve, and be outcome driven. Focus on the customer or user, and harness data and intelligence gathered from your own and other areas of the business to devise the strategy. By focusing the strategy on outcomes, rather than output &ndash; and making sure each channel is integrated into that strategy to maintain a coherent narrative and experience - marketers can better avoid the curse of bombardment. Something that is increasingly problematic in today&rsquo;s noisy landscape filled with meaningless content and bland product-focused &lsquo;shouty&rsquo; messaging. </p><p> In addition, a rock solid strategy makes room for greater creativity. We&rsquo;ve long been advocates of the notion that creative marketing occurs in its most brilliant form when defined outcomes and restrictions or regulations are at work. The perception of the terms &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; and &lsquo;creative marketing&rsquo; among marketers and wider organisations has always been a challenge. There is a fear associated with those terms, typically being perceived as something fluffy or an indulgence, completely disconnected from the business strategies and processes. Yet we would argue that if something is considered creative, yet fails to impact the bottom line in some way, then it is far from being creative, it is irrelevant. Creative marketing initiatives, underpinned by rock solid strategies, rather than being regarded frivolous and without commercial value, will be understood in terms of being the most powerful way to communicate a message to a target audience.</p><p> Armed with a clear vision, purpose and roadmap, break down silos and importantly, communicate the strategy to the board and across the business with clarity and purpose, to gain buy in and participation. This fosters a culture of trust and collaboration, making it much easier to work in an agile way, to maximise opportunities, and ultimately to deliver more impactful marketing. </p><h3> Drive a Strong Brand, One With Purpose.</h3><p> <br/> With new entrants launching and competing with established financial services organisations at breakneck speed, the importance of brand has never been more acute. There are several ways in which the brand impacts financial services organisations. </p><p> The brand is the thing that differentiates one organisation from another. Building brand equity is essential in today&rsquo;s market. By shifting communications away from product messaging and answering the &lsquo;why&rsquo; questions, customers are given the opportunity to understand and get behind a particular brand, trusting the business with their finances. And this resonates for both heavily intermediated B2B and B2C focused organisations. Customers increasingly want to form connections with the people looking after their financial interests, and search for organisations with core values that fit with their own, in addition to the quality of services of products, of course. A strong brand enables organisations to stand out from the myriad of competitors for the right reasons. And what&rsquo;s more, if performance dips, a strong brand will garner more loyalty among customers than a weak one.</p><p> Importantly, brand and performance are intrinsically linked. Underpinned by an outcome focused strategy, the powerful combination of brand and strategic vision ensures that marketing remains fully aligned with business objectives. If an organisation&rsquo;s people buy into and work according to the brand, the impact is huge. Each and every interaction with the customer &ndash; on and offline &ndash; will be authentic; the overall brand experience will be consistent; service provision will adhere to quality standards; and the value proposition will be communicated externally and understood internally. The brand is a strong factor in attracting and anchoring talent. Believing in the vision and purpose of the organisation for which they work, employees will strive to perform well. </p><p> The brand forms the foundation of the culture of the organisation, capturing its core values and purpose. Its strength and validity is something which cannot be underestimated in terms of supporting sustainable performance and engaging new customers. Marketers must identify and define the brand, and ensure it is adopted and followed across each function of the business.</p><h3> Embrace Digital, Fully.</h3><p> <br/> The digital transformation is well under way in the majority of organisations, but fully connecting the digitisation to marketing is, for some, a long way off. However, marketers must get to grips with, and take an integrated approach to digital, looking comprehensively at a number of elements that will help to achieve defined outcomes. The relationship between financial services and digital transformation is highly complex. However if we focus here on how marketers can harness digital to achieve the outcome of reaching new customers, a good starting point is to look at connections, technology, and measurement. </p><p> Before any rich media content, tweet, advert or email campaigns, must come data analysis. The intelligent use of data from digital channels helps to inform robust strategies around driving new and enhanced connections. First of all, marketers need to identify each touchpoint in the lifecycle and analyse every interaction and customer journey, on every device. Review the pain points and recognise the successful interactions that engage the target audience. Identify the opportunities for improved interactions. Extract every bit of relevant data available to gain a granular understanding of the customer experience. And then cross reference this insight with intelligence gained from talking to the client facing teams in your business. They have expert knowledge that will support and help to contextualise the vast amounts of data. </p><p> The impact of technology on marketing to gain new customers is fundamental. From website CMSs offering exceptional lead generation, digital marketing and personalisation capabilities, to remarketing services and adtech products extending reach and engagement. Not to mention the proliferation of devices, emerging creative technologies and social media algorithms impacting content creation and marketing and distribution in exciting ways, technology is the enabler in a marketer&rsquo;s strategy. </p><p> The data produced during each interaction has transformed marketing management, effectiveness and performance measurement. While the management of data is a gargantuan task, we now have access to information that provides a deep understanding of the customer journey and the effectiveness of communications. By analysing, testing and optimising all the time, relentlessly we would hope, marketers are able to make their customers&rsquo; journeys and experiences seamless, purposeful and even enjoyable. Effective data management and smart application of data is key to finding that marketing sweetspot: communicating with those we want to connect with, across the channels most relevant to them, with messages that resonate. And ultimately, encouraging them to carry out a desired action. </p><p> Digital enables marketers to better reach the people they want to, to provide more relevant experiences to individuals and to grow deeper connections with customers. According to the CBI/PwC report, IT investment is expected to increase by 75% in the coming year. While we can&rsquo;t predict how much of that will be directly for marketing purposes, we recommend marketers adapt to and harness the opportunities that technologies bring to insight, efficiency and performance. With one eye on the horizon, learn everything you can, communicate with business and IT teams, and understand how digital can be used to both enhance existing customer experience and create connections with new customers. </p><p> Financial services marketing is a complex beast, but by focusing on the people, the brand and developing an integrated strategy underpinned by digital, marketers will be well placed to grasp the opportunities afforded by increased optimism and any investment they manage to secure for their efforts.</p><p> Check out our whitepaper  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dogdigital.com/docs/dog_creative_transformation_whitepaper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Creative with investment: Addressing the need for creative transformation in financial services marketing  </a> </u> .

{"original_id":2674,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The 7 Warning Signs of Disengagement","link":"the-7-warning-signs-of-disengagement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How many of us have been driving our car when a flashing warning sign shows up unexpectedly on our dashboard? I will admit it; that freaks me out. I stop as soon as I can, go into the glove compartment and pull out the owner&rsquo;s manual so I can try and figure out what the picture means. Most times you can avert trouble before it really starts just by being aware of warning signs.</p><p> I was thinking about this concept of warning signs and how it relates to the critical business imperative of engagement in the workplace. While the signs of a disengaged employee may not be constantly flashing bright like a neon sign in Las Vegas, they really are there for all to see if you just know what to look for. So, assuming we are on the journey to full engagement in the workplace, here are the 7 warning signs to look for on your dashboard.</p><p> <strong>  I Don&rsquo;t Care Attitude. </strong>  These employees have given up on even making a pretense of caring about the work. They show up and do what is expected but don&rsquo;t expend energy to make sure the work is high quality. It&rsquo;s all about just getting it done, not about getting it done right.</p><p> <strong>  Increased Absences or Tardiness. </strong> Disengaged employees have trouble getting up in the morning and arriving to work on time. They show up when they want, not when they are scheduled to be there. They tend to suffer more than their engaged colleagues with stress-related illnesses. These symptoms could be as small as a headache or cold, but as large as depression, anxiety or deep sadness.</p><p> <strong>  Declining Quality of Work. </strong> Employees who used to care about the quality of their work and paid attention to small details no longer have the energy or desire to do so. They simply don&rsquo;t care if all the i&rsquo;s are dotted and the t&rsquo;s are crossed. It&rsquo;s more about just checking off the box and moving on to the next task. Error rates increase when employees are not engaged in the job at hand, and work is done at a slower pace.</p><p> <strong>  Mood Swings. </strong>  Is today a good day or a bad one? People who are disengaged tend to have more mood swings than others. Usually they wear their emotions on their face. It gets harder and harder for them to hide their moods, and they prefer to just go with their feelings. They don&rsquo;t care if others notice because how they feel is how they show up.</p><p> <strong>  Isolating Themselves From Others. </strong> Isolation can take two forms. One can be intentional, where the disengaged employee chooses to opt out. That happens a lot in larger group settings. Someone sits back and does not participate in the conversation. They don&rsquo;t join in hallway conversations or at the local lunch joint with the rest of the team. The second way it can show up is in their own heads because  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ruthkross.com/from-invisibility-to-reengagment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   many disengaged employees feel like they are invisible even in a very visible role  </a> </u> . They believe others ignore them in the group, even if there is no validity to this feeling.</p><p> <strong>  No Creativity or Input. </strong> Something happens when a person falls into disengagement. They suddenly appear to become mute. A once defining voice is seemingly nonexistent.

If it seems like I've mentioned him before, I have. A few weeks ago, I wrote about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/07/six-rules-for-smart-simplicity-and.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Six Rules for Smart Simplicity and Employee Engagement  </a> </u> , another post inspired by one of his TED Talks. <br/> <br/> In this latest TED Talk, <strong>  he introduces the holy trinity of efficiency </strong>  - clarity, accountability, and measurement - and makes you think twice about whether: (1) these three really make you more efficient - or less efficient - and (2) you're focusing on the right things to do your job and to be productive. <br/> <br/> I like things that make us think differently and question or challenge \"conventional wisdom.\" <br/> <br/> Yves uses the example of a relay race and how cooperation is key; in his words...</p><p> Miracle of cooperation: it multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts. It is the essence of human efforts: how we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others. With cooperation, we can do more with less.</p><p>  ... and talks about how that holy trinity can really muck things up for the runners in the race - and for you. <br/> <br/> We're so driven by  <strong>  clarity </strong>  and clarifying everything that we, instead, put up these boundaries that require people to work within them, within this box. And if they step outside, they either don't know what to do or fear doing something they shouldn't. <br/> <br/> With regards to <strong>   accountability </strong> , he believes what we're really looking for is someone to blame when the thing we're trying to do fails. We spend more time making sure we know who to blame than making sure everyone is set up for success. <br/> <br/> And, finally, when it comes to  <strong>  measurement </strong> , we've been taught to follow the mantra, what gets measured gets done. But are we measuring the right things and, hence, doing the right things? Are we focusing on the right metric to get the job done in the best way? <br/> <br/> He sums it all up nicely here: <br/> <br/> You know, this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces, middle offices, coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources, but that also add obstacles. And the more complicated the organization, the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening. So we need summaries, proxies, reports, key performance indicators, metrics. So people put their energy in what can get measured, at the expense of cooperation. And as performance deteriorates, we add even more structure, process, systems. People spend their time in meetings, writing reports they have to do, undo and redo. Based on our analysis, teams in these organizations spend between 40 and 80 percent of their time wasting their time, but working harder and harder, longer and longer, on less and less value-adding activities. This is what is killing productivity, what makes people suffer at work. </p><p> He believes that too many rules, processes, and metrics are keeping us from doing our best work and that the one thing to save us is  <strong>  cooperation </strong> , i.e., how we get things done, together. Critical to this, though, is a culture of cooperation, a culture that supports us doing our best work together by simplifying and by focusing on the parts that really matter - and by remembering that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Without a doubt, executives need to be on board with this shift in thinking (and doing). <br/> <br/> What do you think? Does that holy trinity get in the way of your employees doing their best work? Are those three items obstacles to being efficient and productive?  <br/> <br/> There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all. -Peter Drucker</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-09 20:06:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-09 20:06:02.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_04AVTzK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-holy-trinity-of-inefficiency/\", \"post_id\": \"5998\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-09 20:06:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-09 20:06:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-holy-trinity-of-inefficiency\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"5997\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2742\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441743983986-af31827a8d31-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"427\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441904400,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2676,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Steps to Craft a Killer Welcome Pack","link":"7-steps-to-craft-a-killer-welcome-pack","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently I joined a coaching group. I was impressed by their IP, wooed by their style and eventually made the decision to join their group workshop program. The fee was reasonably decent, but I figured that what I could do with what they taught me, and the outcomes I could help my clients get as a secondary result, would more than pay for the investment.</p><p> Invariably though a few days after signing on the dotted line, it was natural I&rsquo;d start questioning the decision. <strong>  Would I get value? Had I been sold? Had I acted impulsively? </strong></p><h3> Buyers remorse is a powerful thing.</h3><p> <br/> It starts as a seed and, unless dealt with, will eventually blossom into flowers of discontent.</p><p> On the flip side, humans also like to talk themselves into believing they&rsquo;ve made the right call. We like to tell people how the new car we&rsquo;ve bought is the best ever, or that our new phone is better than its competitor, as long as the conditions are right.</p><p> The same is very true of advice. Getting a client to see the value of advice and agree to proceed isn&rsquo;t getting any easier. When you then take into account what&rsquo;s written about advice these days, the last thing you want is for them to start to regret signing up for your advice and start looking for a way out.</p><p> Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a pretty easy solution.</p><p> One week after I&rsquo;d joined the coaching group, a package arrived. It was a big, padded thing. The kind of package that makes you excited in the same way it did when you were a kid.</p><p> I opened it and got more excited. This wasn&rsquo;t a welcome letter and a wall calendar. This was a box of goodies, hand picked to make me feel special.</p><p> Frankly, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing any advice who wants to be seen as a class act should be seeking to emulate.</p><p> <strong>  So, to get practical. What might your killer Welcome Pack look like? </strong></p><li> <strong>  Start with the box. </strong> Get them custom made with your logo on the top. Make them sturdy and significant; the kind your clients will want to keep and put all their financial documents in. Try  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.trusty.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Trusty Cases &amp; Boxes  </a> </u>  for a good selection of custom options.</li><li> <strong>  Create a glossy welcome letter. </strong> Include pictures and make it the kind of message that says. &ldquo;Congratulations for making the best decision of your life!&rdquo; Instead of &ldquo;Dear Sir/ Madam. Blah blah zzzzzz&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  How about a series of checklists or worksheets </strong> to help them establish a financial decision making framework, perhaps including a list of all the financial events that should be a trigger for getting in contact with you? Make it clear from the start when you&rsquo;re available to them and when they will need your help.</li><li> <strong>  A custom-branded USB stick </strong> ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.flashbay.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FlashBay  </a> </u>  has a good selection of options) packed with not only all the documentation and PDS&rsquo;s, but also a selection of the best Podcasts, recorded webinars you&rsquo;ve delivered (ideally), money-related TED talks and other cool tools that have inspired you to think about money differently. If you know your target market (and why wouldn&rsquo;t you?), this is the single biggest opportunity of all. What content would add value to small business owners? How about Mums and Dads?</li><li> <strong>  Whilst you&rsquo;re at it, record a quick personal video message and put it in the root folder.  </strong> Name the file WATCH ME FIRST. You might want to also introduce the rest of the team with a pre-recorded video that gets added to the end.</li><li> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the best book you&rsquo;ve ever read about money? </strong> Why not put it in there too. Even better, if you happen to have authored one yourself, whack that in there with a personal message written in the cover.</li><li> <strong>  Finally, how about something memorable? </strong> If you want to be remembered as remarkable, give something clients will remark about. Ditch the cheap branded pen or the impersonal bottle of wine/ champagne and include something that no-one else would. A wind up toy robot. A kinder egg. A novelty key ring. A pair of colourful socks. A classy moleskin style notebook with a favourite quote on the cover. Something that&rsquo;s likely to put a smile on someone&rsquo;s face and leave an emotional mark. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be expensive either. Try  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aliexpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   aliexpress.com  </a> </u>  and get creative.</li><p> If you&rsquo;re purchasing in quantities of 50 packs at a time or more, you should be able to squeeze all that in for well under $100 a pop. A small price to pay for making a killer post-purchase impression, don&rsquo;t you think?</p><p> Welcome Packs are a chance for a business to roll out the red carpet, banish buyers remorse and allow clients to start congratulating themselves on a good purchase decision. Even more than that, it&rsquo;s a chance to get creative, differentiate our businesses from the bland and have a little fun to boot. Personally, the more fun I have the more I end up loving what I do. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the same for you and your staff.</p><p> Anyway, that&rsquo;s my Pack ideas. What are yours? What does yours contain? What gets commented on by your clients?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 15:00:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 15:00:22.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_rWHgHjq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-steps-to-craft-a-killer-welcome-pack/\", \"post_id\": \"6002\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 15:00:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 15:00:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-steps-to-craft-a-killer-welcome-pack\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6001\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2745\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-10-at-7.47.02-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2754\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441976400,"author_id":456,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2677,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Ways Income Planning Can Help Your Clients Navigate The Future","link":"three-ways-income-planning-can-help-your-clients-navigate-the-future","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Today&rsquo;s investor has an average of 3.6 relationships with financial services providers. 1  While diversifying among asset classes is one of the best decisions investors can make, many clients mistakenly think that diversifying across financial advisors is also a good strategy. Unfortunately, this tactic can prevent clients from understanding their full financial picture. Giving clients a clear and concise roadmap for their retirement income needs can help establish you as the retirement expert in your community, and it can help clients make better decisions about their future. We think an income plan can help you illustrate to your clients the value of consolidating their assets with one trusted advisor.</p><h3> Why Income Planning and Why Do It Now?</h3><p> <br/> One of the basic tenets of behavioral economics is that investors have the ability to make better decisions when planning for their future than they do when making decisions in the here-and-now. In one classic study, participants were asked whether they would choose to eat a banana or a chocolate bar at a later date in the future, such as next week. When presented with the choice of a healthy option or an unhealthy option, 70% said they would choose the banana. However, when presented with the option of choosing a banana versus a chocolate bar today, 70% of participants chose the chocolate.</p><p> &ldquo;The same psychology works in finance. When faced with a future choice, we generally select a smarter option, such as savings, while an immediate choice triggers the pleasure of spending. The science is clear. Brain scans show that the emotional and logical areas of our brains wrestle over immediate decisions, but our logical bits rule when considering our future well-being.&rdquo; 2</p><h3> Three Ways a Simple and Straightforward Income Plan Can Help Clients</h3><h3> <br/> 1. It Gives Investments a Purpose</h3><p> <br/> Together with a personal benchmark, a clear income planning roadmap can help keep clients focused on their unique goals, not on arbitrary market benchmarks. It&rsquo;s a straightforward approach to investing that can help clients achieve a genuine level of preparedness for retirement.</p><p> The income planning process can help you answer the most relevant questions for your clients:</p><li> <strong>  How much money will I need in retirement? </strong></li><li> <strong>  When can I retire? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will my spouse and/or children be OK if something happens to me? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Can I leave a legacy? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> 2. It Spreads Investment Risk Out Over Time,Helping Investors Remain Confident</h3><p> <br/> Using time as a risk management tool, an income plan can help you safeguard short term income needs in vehicles like money markets and duration protected income vehicles, while investing riskier assets like equities in buckets that will not need to be tapped for 10 years or more. Time can manage volatility, since over long periods of time, the effects of market spikes are smoothed out. Using a bucket approach to asset management can help spread a client&rsquo;s risk out throughout their investing lifecycle. Most importantly, if the markets go through a period of volatility, clients with a longer time horizon can rest assured that their long-term investments have time to recover from losses since they will not be drawing income from longer term buckets.</p><h3> 3. It Can Help Investors Pay Themselves First</h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s baby boomer clients have complex needs. Many find themselves strapped between expensive college tuition payments, caring for their parents, and trying to save for their own retirement. They commonly make the mistake of raiding their retirement accounts in order to pay for their kids&rsquo; tuition, which can have catastrophic effects on their retirement. In fact, Fidelity data shows a spike in people borrowing from their 401(k)s in the third quarter of every year, which they suspect is to pay for children&rsquo;s college tuition. 3</p><p> Although young adults can take out loans for tuition, there is no loan for retirement income. By presenting clients with a personalized income plan, you can help prevent them from derailing their own retirement needs and help them make informed decisions about their future.</p><h3> What to Look for in Income Planning Technology</h3><p> <br/> A typical financial advisor will present a client with an investment plan with the hope of reaching a certain annual return, usually tied to a benchmark. They provide a timeframe and assume the client&rsquo;s investments will appreciate enough to provide the income necessary. We think there&rsquo;s a better way to help clients understand exactly how their life goals will be funded by their investment strategy.</p><p> Income planning software should map out the income needs of the client over time, and do it in a straightforward, highly visual way. By segmenting out the income needs of the investor over time periods, clients can see that the money they need to draw from first stays invested in safer vehicles such as duration protected bonds or money markets. More volatile, higher-return-seeking investments remain further out in the time horizon, making them less susceptible to the ups and downs of the market.</p><p> As our industry begins to address the income needs of the aging baby boomer population, arming clients with a personalized roadmap can help them stay on the right track to reach their desired outcomes. An income plan can bridge the gap between the investment plan and the actual execution of it, helping clients truly understand how their money will work for them. <br/>  </p>1 Cerulli Associates.

{"original_id":2678,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Key To Giving-Up Control is Delegation","link":"the-key-to-giving-up-control-is-delegation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In my consulting work I encounter many different types of management styles and I have found the most successful leaders are those that empower their employees to do their best work every day.  This requires you to motivate your employees to think creatively, allow them the freedom to work unfettered by too many rules, and to trust that everyone has noble intent to do a good job.  <strong>  As a business owner, you must be willing to delegate, and relinquish control, a scary proposition at times I admit, but a management strategy that will reward you and your team.  </strong></p><p> In addition to creating a more engaged and motivated team one of the hidden benefits of delegation is that it will create leverage and capacity for you and the senior management team.  So if there are so many advantages why don&rsquo;t more leaders master the art of delegation? Quite simply, people don't delegate because it takes a lot of up-front time and effort and they are not confident in the results. Done correctly delegation allows you to make the best use of your time and skills, develops your staff, grooms a successor, and motivates.</p><h3> Poor delegation will cause you frustration, demotivates and confuses the other person, and fails to achieve the task or purpose itself.</h3><p> <br/> Delegation can be a win-win proposition if done correctly, however that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can delegate just anything.  To determine when delegation is most appropriate ask yourself these key questions:</p><li> <strong>  Is it essential or critical that you do it yourself? Or is this a task or responsibility that someone else can handle?  </strong></li><li> <strong>  Does someone else on your team have more experience or the skill to do the task better than you? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Does the task provide an opportunity to grow and develop another person's skills? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do you have enough time to delegate the job effectively? Time must be available for adequate training, for questions and answers, for opportunities to check progress, and for rework if that is necessary. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Once you have determined an appropriate task or responsibility to delegate you need to follow a process to ensure success.  Begin by selecting the right individual for the role and responsibility.  Delegate to the lowest possible level in the organization.  Remember the people who are closest to the work are best suited for the task, because they have the most intimate knowledge of the detail of everyday work. This also increases workplace efficiency, and helps to develop your people. Note, when you first start to delegate to someone, you may notice that he or she takes longer than you do to complete tasks. This is because you are an expert in the field and the person to whom you have delegated is still learning. Be patient: if you have chosen the right person to delegate to, and you are delegating correctly, you will find that he or she quickly becomes competent and reliable.</p><p> Next define the assignment, requirements, parameters, the authority level needed, provide checkpoints and realistic expectations. Clearly articulate the desired outcome you are looking to accomplish. Where are the lines of authority, responsibility and accountability, and make sure to agree on a schedule for getting the work completed.  Explain why the employee is given this task and where it fits in the overall scheme of things in your firm.  Assess the resources that are needed to accomplish the task/responsibility and if training is required for completion.</p><h3> Ensure success through ongoing communication and feedback. </h3><p> <br/> Be available to provide guidance and answer questions but hold the person accountable to making progress.  Concern yourself with what is accomplished, rather than how the work should be done: Your way is not necessarily the only or even the best way!  Allow the person to control his or her own methods and processes. This facilitates success, trust and engagement. Employees thrive when they feel they are not only entrusted with, but also held accountable for, the projects they complete.  Don&rsquo;t forget to ask a lot of questions.  One of the most powerful tools in delegating successfully is to ask questions rather than give instructions. If you say you trust your employees but then tell them how you want them to do every little thing, the message is clear that you don't really trust them after all.</p><p> Lastly make sure you recognize and reward results. Providing timely feedback on results is essential. The employee assigned the project should be recognized and applauded for their successes. By the same token, failures must also be analyzed so that the reason(s) can be turned into opportunities for future learning. Provide recognition where deserved. As a leader, you should get in the practice of complimenting members of your team every time you are impressed by what they have done. This effort on your part will go a long way toward building team member's self-confidence and efficiency, both of which will be improved on the next delegated task.</p><p> <strong>  In the words of Ronald Regan, &ldquo;Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority and don&rsquo;t interfere as long as the policy you&rsquo;ve decided upon is being carried out.&rdquo; </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 16:17:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 16:17:42.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_wQoIe1Y.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-key-to-giving-up-control-is-delegation/\", \"post_id\": \"6006\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 16:17:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 16:17:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-key-to-giving-up-control-is-delegation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6005\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2747\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ronald-reagan_1648803c.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"482\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441999800,"author_id":270,"chart_url":""}

If you&rsquo;re sick in your body or your mind, every other aspect of life is affected.</h3><p> <br/> Good  <a href=\"http://succeedwithoutburnout.com/how-to-easily-transform-your-body-by-completely-renewing-your-mind\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   health  </u>    </a> is something many people would give millions to acquire, if only it could be purchased with money. The truth is; billions of dollars are spent every year in North America in an attempt to treat the symptoms of our sick society. Unfortunately most of those dollars are spent on disease treatment instead of health care.</p><p> Generally people who don&rsquo;t feel well want to get better immediately. You can live without your family, without your friends, even without your money. You can&rsquo;t live without your health.</p><p> Health is one of those things we take for granted as long as we think we have it and become enormously concerned about as soon as we think we&rsquo;re going to lose it.</p><p> The public in general believes they are healthy if they are not experiencing symptoms of illness. However, the absence of symptoms doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean we are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/the-habits-of-healthy-living/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   experiencing health  </a> </u> . Disease is usually present in our bodies long before the symptoms show up.</p><p> You can be free of symptoms and have a stroke or heart attack tomorrow. The presence of disease is the harvest we reap from sowing the seeds of an unfit life. Our bodies have been created to live in harmony, integrity and  <a href=\"http://succeedwithoutburnout.com/17-strategies-to-overcome-burnout-and-achieve-balance-for-life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   balance  </u>  ﻿. </a></p><p> Living a life of mental and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/the-habits-of-healthy-living/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   physical fitness  </a> </u>  will result in a harvest of  <u>  <a href=\"http://succeedwithoutburnout.com/17-strategies-to-overcome-burnout-and-achieve-balance-for-life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wellness  </a> </u> . By focusing on what our human needs are instead of the things that are bad for us and we need to quit doing, we can achieve balance much more quickly.</p><p> Mention the word fitness and most people conjure up the image of hulking figures pumping iron, or competing in triathlons, or simply jogging at the neighborhood Y. Granted, physical fitness is extremely important, but when I talk about fitness being important to keeping our lives in balance, I&rsquo;m speaking of several different types of fitness.</p><p> The three types of fitness I speak about include mental, physical and emotional (spiritual) fitness, since humans are tri-dimensional. Fitness is a combination of strength, endurance, and flexibility. To be fit we need a balance between all three.</p><p> There is a connection between our mind, body and spirit. The thoughts we sow in our mind will affect our physical well-being. The way we look after our physical body will determine our emotional (spiritual) well-being.</p><p> In each area we are what we are because of the seeds we have sown, seeds we have sown in our mind, in our body and in our spirit. We always reap what we sow. The seeds we&rsquo;ve planted are the causes of our disease; the symptoms we experience are simply the harvest. </p><h3> Mental Fitness</h3><p> <br/> The average adult thinks about 60,000 thoughts per day. It is our thoughts that lead to our actions. We can be totally transformed or changed by  <u>  <a href=\"http://succeedwithoutburnout.com/how-to-easily-transform-your-body-by-completely-renewing-your-mind\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   renewing our minds  </a> </u> .</p><p> In order to renew our minds we must focus on that which is good and pure and pour those things into our minds until that which occupied it previously is diluted and eventually replaced with the new. Whatever we focus on gets bigger.</p><p> Likewise, if we focus on those things we don&rsquo;t want, they also increase. The condition of our minds is determined by the diet that we feed our brain, just as the shape of bodies is determined by the diet that we feed our stomachs.</p><p> Just like our bodies, our minds require exercise and rest as well as nutrition in order to grow and maintain fitness.</p><p> Mental nutrition is the food you feed your mind. As soon as you wake up in the morning, begin feeding your mind with positive life-changing information. Information fed to the mind within 15 minutes of awakening is digested very quickly and efficiently.</p><p> Just as you have a dining room to feed your body, you need a dining room to feed your mind. A place of solitude where you go every morning as soon as you awake.</p><p> The place I feed my mind every morning is my reclining chair in the family room. That is where I spend 30-45 minutes feeding my mind during my Power Hour. I also feed my mind by listening to some great  <u>  <a href=\"http://knowgogrow.com/25-free-podcast-sites-for-entrepreneurs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   podcasts  </a> </u>  that educate, motivate and inspire me.</p><p> How about you...are you feeding your mind, body and soul a healthy daily diet? Are getting some exercise every day? If not, will you commit to begin today?</p><h3> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%E2%80%9CIf+you+don%27t+feel+good%2C+nothing+else+matters.%E2%80%9D+-+Ben+Kubassek&amp;via=benkubassek&amp;related=benkubassek&amp;url=http://www.kubassek.com/why-fitness-is-important-and-how-to-balance-mind-body-and-soul/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t feel good, nothing else matters.&rdquo; </a></h3> <p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 19:48:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 19:48:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_YsPCMRL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-fitness-is-important-and-how-to-balance-mind-body-and-soul/\", \"post_id\": \"6008\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 19:48:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 19:48:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-fitness-is-important-and-how-to-balance-mind-body-and-soul\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6007\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2748\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1440993443326-9e9f5aea703a-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1533\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441989900,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}

Use a clean list of TARGETED, opted-in recipients. 32% of marketers say segmenting their email database is one of their top objectives in the next 12 months. Targeting and segmenting will increase your CTR from 3% to 8%</p><p> 2. Send from a REAL PERSON that recipients can reply to.</p><p> 3. Write a killer SUBJECT LINE.</p><p> 4. Tell &lsquo;em what to EXPECT.</p><p> 5. Use an attention-grabbing PREHEADER. This is your next best chance to give your readers a preview of what&rsquo;s inside and incentive to open.</p><p> 6. Display early CALL-TO-ACTION.</p><p> 7. Optimize it for mobile. 38% of all emails are opened on a mobile device. 78% of U.S. email users will access their email via mobile by 2017.</p><p> 8.

{"original_id":2681,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Startup? Positioning is Important to Your Brand","link":"startup-positioning-is-important-to-your-brand","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Market segmentation, product differentiation, and positioning are closely related concepts.  <strong>  Positioning, whether for products or the company behind those products, is about perception. </strong>  Perception pertains to how a customer or user interprets and internalizes information he/she has collected about a product, a company, or a brand. The classic example is that of the word  coke , referring to the carbonated beverage made by numerous companies. When the word  coke  is expressed, most of us will have an image and opinion about a particular brand. How that opinion was formed and placed within the mind of the customer or user illustrates the underlying principle of perception. Perceptions can be changed over time, but often, initial impressions remain strong even in the presence of alternative information. Recall the saying, &ldquo;You never have another chance to make a first impression.&rdquo;</p><p> Perception can occur over time as a company and its products demonstrate their value to customers and users. Typically, this is how brands become successful, as perceptions are created and maintained with many customers and users over significant periods of time.</p><p> A new venture, however, does not have the benefit of significant history for itself or its products and thus needs to form initial perceptions with customers and users through appropriate marketing activities and positioning statements for both products and the company.</p><p> Positioning statements should focus on the benefits the customer or user will realize or feel by using the product or service. Benefits can not only be functional (e.g., performance or design), but they can also be emotional (e.g., latest or hottest mobile device) or utilitarian. Once these benefits are defined, a positioning statement can be developed for a product, service, brand, and company.</p><p> The &ldquo;classical&rdquo; construction of a positioning statement is comprised of the following elements:</p><li> Target customer or user</li><li> Statement of need or opportunity</li><li> Product name</li><li> Product category</li><li> Statement of key benefit or reason to buy</li><p> For products and services, it is useful to think about the image that is most desirable to place in the minds of customers and users. Ideally, a new venture can find the appropriate message and words based on benefits that create an instantaneous space that clearly separates the company from competitors. The formulaic approach is useful for starting the exploration of potential positioning statements for products and services.</p><p> Of course, product-positioning statements can and should be evaluated with focus groups.</p><p> In modern times, positioning statements are used to express a company&rsquo;s desired or goal position within the minds of prospective customers and users without necessarily following a formula. The position statement can be used to express a company&rsquo;s &ldquo;wish&rdquo; for how it would like to be perceived fully expecting that it will be able to satisfy customer and user expectations. For instance, consider the following positioning statements for four companies that compete in the business of providing luxury performance cars:</p><li> <strong>  Mercedes-Benz: </strong>  Engineered like no other car in the world.</li><li> <strong>  BMW:  </strong> The ultimate driving machine.</li><li> <strong>  Audi: </strong>  We delight customers worldwide.</li><li> <strong>  Lexus: </strong> The relentless pursuit of perfection.</li><p> These positioning statements are simple, easy to remember, and virtually instantaneously stick to the mind. Each creates its own unique space in the mind of the reader.</p><p> <strong>  Influencing customer and user perceptions through messaging is very important for a new venture that has yet to sell a product or service. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 19:54:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 19:54:38.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_hRTyBcH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/startup-positioning-is-important-to-your-brand/\", \"post_id\": \"6012\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 19:54:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 19:54:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"startup-positioning-is-important-to-your-brand\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6011\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2750\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Coca-Cola-Comp-Main-Image.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"971\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441998900,"author_id":408,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2682,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Organizational Values Your Business Should Copy","link":"5-organizational-values-your-business-should-copy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You might think they&rsquo;re just simple words, but great organizational values help businesses accomplish their goals and build cultures that fulfill their visions.</p><p> If your business hasn&rsquo;t crafted its own set of company values just yet &mdash; or if it&rsquo;s time to give your existing ones a face-lift &mdash; you should mimic these five organizational values, crafted by five successful enterprises:</p><p> <strong>  1. Do good </strong></p><p> What Google does</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why you don&rsquo;t see pop-up ads on Google searches, the answer can be found in the company&rsquo;s philosophy. While most companies go into business to &ldquo;do good,&rdquo; a passing glance at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google&rsquo;s company values  </a> </u>  shows how the search engine giant takes that mentality to the next level by clearly defining what it does to ensure it doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;do evil.&rdquo;</p><p> How you can do it too</p><p> Your company can similarly choose to do only good deeds. For example, a marketing agency shouldn&rsquo;t try to sell a small business a content package designed for a Fortune 500 company. Instead, such agencies should work to provide their clients with products that will help them meet their objectives.</p><p> <strong>  2. Focus on quality </strong></p><p> What Coke does</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/coca-cola/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u> , Coca-Cola is the world&rsquo;s fourth most valuable brand. In today&rsquo;s age of the health-conscious consumer, that number might surprise you. But to those familiar with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/mission-vision-values\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Coke&rsquo;s values  </a> </u> , it probably doesn&rsquo;t: &ldquo;What we do, we do well,&rdquo; the company says. Today, Coke sells 3,500 different beverages in more than 200 countries.</p><p> How you can do it too</p><p> By never losing sight of your company&rsquo;s commitment to quality, you&rsquo;re less likely to lose any loyal customers &mdash; and more likely to gain new ones. As you develop new products and target new customers, never relax your standards. And don&rsquo;t forget the old adage: It&rsquo;s better to do one thing very well instead of doing lots of things poorly.</p><p> <strong>  3. Support your staff </strong></p><p> What Whole Foods does</p><p> You can&rsquo;t really expect your business to thrive if your employees feel as though they&rsquo;re taken for granted. Many companies, like  <u>  Whole Foods </u> , are especially vocal about how prospective candidates are treated once they join the team. For example, Whole Foods says all employees&rsquo; ideas are valued, as everyone has something to contribute. The chain also allows its employees to work as part of self-directed teams, increasing their autonomy.</p><p> How you can do it too</p><p> By adopting a similar employee-focused philosophy, your business stands to become noticeably healthier. To do that, encourage your employees to share their ideas and routinely solicit their feedback. Offer opportunities for professional development so they&rsquo;ll grow with you.</p><p> <strong>  4. Give back to the community </strong></p><p> What TINYpulse does</p><p> Business isn&rsquo;t just about seeing how much money you can make. It&rsquo;s also about doing what you can to improve the world around you, something that extends beyond simply the products and services you sell.</p><p> To this end, supporting nonprofit initiatives and giving back to local communities are core tenets of many businesses. For example, we at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TINYpulse  </a> </u>  donate 1% of our product and 1% of our time to nonprofit organizations and communities. We believe that in addition to simply being the right thing to do, giving back makes our employees happier, which in turn helps them better serve our clients.</p><p> How you can do it too</p><p> If your organization isn&rsquo;t involved in your community, it might be time to take a look at volunteer opportunities that double as team-building exercises. In doing so, your workers will grow closer to one another and feel better about themselves. You organization will look great too.</p><p> <strong>  5. Love your customers </strong></p><p> What Amazon does</p><p> While there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to make sure all of your customers are completely satisfied 100% of the time, you can create a culture that encourages positive experiences. For example,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.jobs/principles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Amazon  </a> </u>  is a company that describes itself as &ldquo;customer obsessed&rdquo; &mdash; and if you&rsquo;ve ever had a problem with an order and reached out to the e-commerce giant, you know exactly what that means. Simply put, whenever something goes wrong, Amazon remedies it.</p><p> How you can do it too</p><p> You may be surprised what happens when you similarly put your customers at the center of your operations: they&rsquo;ll become loyal. And remember, loyal customers may make up only 15% of your clientele, but they can account for as much as 70% of your revenue, according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.crmtrends.com/loyalty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CRMTrends  </a> </u> .</p><p> Crafting and adhering to sensible company values can do wonders for your business. Who knows? Maybe one of the values your organization develops and abides by will serve to guide the businesses of tomorrow.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 20:06:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 20:06:53.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_jD03fAs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-organizational-values-your-business-should-copy/\", \"post_id\": \"6014\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 20:06:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 20:06:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-organizational-values-your-business-should-copy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6013\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2751\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Westlake_Photo_Official_sm_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"309\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441994400,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}

But what are they really doing to get to know Millennials as a group?</p><p> The Financial Services Industry could do well to recognize that Millennials are very specific about what they want from their Financial Advisors:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Millennials-and-their-Money-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Millennials and their Money 1\" src=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Millennials-and-their-Money-1.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> <u>  Source: Millennials and Money Merryl Lynch </u></p><p> This survey highlights the importance of really understanding what Millennials want to do with their money, and what kind of relationship they want with their financial advisor.</p><p> The message: Get to know Millennials. Understanding the Millennials behavioral style will enable messaging to be targeted to the individual. Regardless of their age or generation &ndash; are the Millennials naturally spenders or savers, goal driven or content to build a balanced life, risk takers or cautious, trusting or skeptical etc.? Put another way, Millennials can be your &ldquo;Millionaire Next Door&rdquo; type who is frugal or that person who lives large, spending all they have in the belief tomorrow will take care of itself. There have been these types of people across all generations.</p><p> With this insight, find the most appropriate medium to converse with them. Revealing their behavioral style, core talents, and decision-making approach will ensure you get their attention if you translate that knowledge into a personalized offering. Remember, Millennials now represent the largest generation in the United States.</p><p> For every person, regardless of generation, there is always a lot going on below the surface that is motivating his or her life and financial behavior. Generally, these behaviors cannot be easily or quickly measured by human observation. This then makes it difficult to know how extreme and/or predictable the behavior will be.</p><p> A structured behavioral finance approach benefits both the advisor and the client by making the advisory process more tangible and robust. This is achieved by both the advisor and client participating in an objective financial behavior discovery process when the planning process starts.</p><p> A key point that financial advisors must always remember is that their behavioral style will influence how they perceive the investment markets, their clients, and the advice they give. Research studies show that advisors can have &ldquo;Over-Confidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Myopic Loss Aversion.&rdquo; Therefore, advisors will have a behavioral bias that may influence their recommendations. This together with a population segment bias about Millennials, ensures the financial services industry will be unlikely to attract any new younger clients, regardless of demographic. In other words, do you already have a bias towards Millennials based on all the adverse publicity they are receiving? It&rsquo;s a question worth asking and answering.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www4.troweprice.com/%20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Millennials are not dummies  </a> </u> . According to a new survey undertaken by T. Rowe Price:</p><p> The 18 to 34 year-old set is better about tracking their spending and sticking to a budget than Baby Boomers. 75% track their expenses carefully. 76% of Millennials stick to a budget; 40% of Millennials have increased their 401(k) contributions in the past twelve months.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www4.troweprice.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source: Millennial Investment Behavior  </a> </u> .</p><p> Uncovering and understanding the behavioral style of Millennial clients and how they want to use their money allows the Financial Advisor to target their services more effectively. Harvard Business Review in their article &ldquo;Stop Designing for Millennials&rdquo; highlights the importance of understanding customer attitudes and behaviors:</p><p> Defining an ideal customer for a potential product or service using broader human themes allows you to create solutions that resonate with a larger group of people. ..Far too many companies take a &ldquo;product-out&rdquo; view of segmentation, where they essentially ask their customers to line up around their products by demographics such as age or income. They should take an &ldquo;outside-in&rdquo; view that orients its products around their customers&rsquo; attitudes and behaviors instead. Meeting the functional and emotional needs of a group of people is much more likely to generate transformative results than targeting a generational cohort with tenuous links.  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/06/stop-designing-for-millennials\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source: Stop Designing for Millennials HBR  </a> </u></p><p> An example of this approach can be seen in the fall off of the banking system as we know it.</p><p> Almost all (88%) of Millennials do their banking online and half of those use their smartphone to do so. This experience leads about three-fourths of Millennials (73%) to be &ldquo;more excited about a new offering in financial services from Google, Amazon, Apple, Paypal or Square&rdquo; than from a nationwide bank. Since both the technology and the financial wherewithal to offer such services exists within these firms, the study&rsquo;s prediction of &ldquo;seismic&rdquo; change in the near term future of banking appears to be at least a realistic vision of the future.&rdquo;  <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/05/millennials-wall-st/brookings_winogradfinal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Source: &ldquo;Millennials Invest More Time in Digital Banking,&rdquo; emarketer.com, March 25, 2014  </u>  . </a></p><p> As a financial advisor:</p><li> You must learn how to communicate with Millennials on their unique terms defined by their behavioral style (regardless of the communication vehicle).</li><li> If you know the Millennials behavioral style, then you know how to frame information to attract them.</li><li> Get to know where your inherent bias and behavior sits. Then learn how to manage both.</li><li> Stop reading Millennial-focused press clippings that cause undue bias or incorrect perceptions about them.</li><li> Get to know the Millennials already in your world.

Well, neither of those are true based on statistics on retirement readiness, or surveys about satisfaction with the financial industry. <strong>  So we set out to understand how people really think and feel, so we could invent a better way </strong>  to help them. Our study of affluent individuals and families, conducted by Barnaby Riedel, PhD and co-founder of Reidel Strategy, painted a very different picture of people&rsquo;s financial lives.Our survey participants were asked to tell us their financial life story in chapters with highs and lows, just like a book about themselves. Turning points typically mark the transition of one chapter to another, and what  <strong>  we learned was that 83% of all turning points involved a trade-off decision </strong> . For the most part we&rsquo;re all making choices every day that can have a huge impact on our lives. A good trade-off can create a &ldquo;high&rdquo; in your story, others are, in retrospect, decisions that trigger a &ldquo;low&rdquo;.Here are some examples of important tradeoffs that do have a major financial implication, but they are also  <strong>  choices that touch on values, history and emotions. </strong> These are the topics that can cause stress in marriages, or result in sleepless nights:</p><li> Do I work longer hours to advance my career or spend more time with my family?</li><li> Do we buy a bigger home with a longer commute, or a smaller one which would get me home sooner?</li><li> Do we pay for private school or will a public education keep our kids more grounded?</li><strong> Very few advisers are equipped to have these conversations.</strong>The wealth management industry pushes to get people focused on saving, investing and big end goals like retirement, but the truth is the decisions that people have more control of, like the questions above, have the greatest impact on people&rsquo;s lives. <strong> The adviser can&rsquo;t make these decisions for you, but she or he can help you if they know how!</strong>What we have learned is that <strong> a financial life isn&rsquo;t about money &ndash; it&rsquo;s about your entire life.</strong>And you certainly can&rsquo;t have it all &ndash; no matter how much money you have. It&rsquo;s about choices that eventually create a high point or a low point as you move through your own very unique story. Most often the memorable moments in your financial life are when you have to choose between money and living your ideal life.Life is a series of tradeoffs, and <strong> more of one thing usually means less of another. </strong> There are many variables to our lives &ndash; work, family, hobbies, health &ndash; and a finite set of resources &ndash; time, energy, money. You can&rsquo;t have it all, but you can make better choices if you&rsquo;re aware of your values and priorities, and conscious of how your decisions affect your entire life.That takes the right kind of guidance and perspective and tools that you can really use- and it looks nothing like the old-fashioned advice model.<strong> We call it financial life management.</strong>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 20:21:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 20:21:23.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_0x0wwhI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/life-is-a-series-of-trade-offs/\", \"post_id\": \"6020\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 20:21:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 20:21:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"life-is-a-series-of-trade-offs\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6019\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2754\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441794016917-7b6933969960-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"725\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441997100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2686,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"9 Truths HR Will Never Tell a Job Candidate","link":"9-truths-hr-will-never-tell-a-job-candidate","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;d like to offer I was a bit loose with the title. The Human Resources persona is not technically correct. Those that sit on the interviewer&rsquo;s side of the table can be from HR (or Recruitment), but many are hiring officials or other employees.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve worked with several hundred HR resources during my career. I&rsquo;d estimate ninety percent of them are not only highly competent, but also have their hearts in the right place when it comes to hiring and employee management.</p><p> Even so, those individuals are often handicapped&mdash;saddled with other contributors to the interviewing process who are paid to do something else for a living. As such, you will encounter a collection of inexperienced or ineffective interviewers. This often leads to many stumbles in the process.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a peek at some of them and what you can do:</p><p> Let&rsquo;s just hire someone and then we&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p><p> <strong>  We don&rsquo;t know exactly whom we seek so your guess is as good as ours. </strong>  The biggest mistake employers make is not being clear upfront&mdash;with themselves&mdash;regarding who specifically they seek. You&rsquo;re left to guess. Since you&rsquo;re not a mind reader, ask questions to help you triangulate a successful profile and highlight how you match those traits. What type of person would be successful in this role? What would you consider a successful first year for a person in this role?</p><p> <strong>  The reason we can&rsquo;t tell you what success looks like for this job is because we&rsquo;re not sure </strong> . If you can&rsquo;t assess this during your interview how will you know whether you can do the job or like the job? Make sure to ask about the key metrics the company will use to evaluate the person. If they can&rsquo;t address them, ask them to provide qualitative points they consider important for success in the position.</p><p> Can someone turn on the VACANCY sign?</p><p> <strong>  We just fired someone (or are about to) so you better not in any way resemble him or her. </strong> Uh huh. Now what? Make sure to ask why the position is open. If the interviewer indicates someone was recently removed, ask why. You can also ask questions such as, &ldquo;What type of traits or skills would a new person have that would be an upgrade at that position?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The reason the position is open is because the employee who previously held this position correctly assessed that your potential boss was a &ldquo;Bad Boss&rdquo; excerpt from the Good Boss, Bad Boss series. </strong>  Make sure to thoroughly evaluate your potential boss. What style works for him or her? How does he or she get along with subordinates? What are his or her expectations?</p><p> We don&rsquo;t care what you want as much as we care about what we want.</p><p> <strong>  We don&rsquo;t care as much about what you want as we do whether you have the skills to do the job. </strong> You should care about everything, but especially whether the employer can satisfy your needs and wants. First, make your list of needs and make sure it&rsquo;s lengthy. (See  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/top-12-happiness-factors-employees/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Top 12 Happiness Factors for Employees  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/the-secret-to-avoid-career-stagnation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Secret to Avoid Career Stagnation  </a> </u>  to get started.) Second, design your questions to elicit information you need to make a fully-informed decision regarding whether employer can actually make you happy. (See  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/39-great-questions-ask-job-interview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   39 Great Questions to Ask in a Job Interview  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/ask-perfect-job-interview-question/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How to Ask the Perfect Job Interview Question  </a> </u> .)</p><p> We never said we were mentalists.</p><p> <strong>  We&rsquo;re not mind readers or very skilled at interviewing so please ask us very specific questions so we can provide you exactly what you need to know. </strong> This works both ways. Make sure to ask good questions (the more the better) and leverage your list of happiness factors. You also need to be mindful of this when telling your stories in response to their questions. See the series 5 Ways to Make People Remember Your Job Interview starting with  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/5-ways-make-people-remember-job-interview-part-1-keep-short-simple/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   How to Keep it Short and Simple  </u>  .  </a></p><p> The Theory of Relativity is really prevalent in our company.</p><p> <strong>  The reason there&rsquo;s a delay in the recruitment process is because we&rsquo;re confused more now than when we started interviewing candidates. </strong> This happens when companies see live targets. They often don&rsquo;t have strong plans going in and now you&rsquo;ve convoluted things by opening your mouth. (Shame on you.) Stay in contact with them and be clear regarding your interest. They will sort it out soon enough. If they don&rsquo;t, you probably won&rsquo;t want the job anyway.</p><p> <strong>  The reason there&rsquo;s a delay in the recruitment process is because we&rsquo;re scurrying to get another candidate through it. </strong> As I mentioned in the previous point, they might be confused but they might also be attempting to move another candidate through the process. Make sure to ask whether there are other candidates in contention and how you fit relative to the others.</p><p> <strong>  The reason there&rsquo;s a delay even though we told you we&rsquo;re preparing an employment offer for you is because we&rsquo;re trying to get approval for something we thought we had. </strong>  Unless you are a very senior-level executive with several components to your compensation, a company should be able to turn around an offer letter and package relatively quickly once it decides to do so. Most are simply form letters with a few changes to name, rank, and compensation. If you think something sounds funny, it likely is. Press the company a bit to see if they&rsquo;ll indicate what&rsquo;s holding up the process. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 20:26:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 20:26:53.000000","image_url":"uploads/2015/09/9-truths-hr-will-never-tell-a-job-candidate.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/9-truths-hr-will-never-tell-a-job-candidate/\", \"post_id\": \"6022\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 20:26:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 20:26:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"9-truths-hr-will-never-tell-a-job-candidate\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6021\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2755\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9-truths-hr-will-never-tell-a-job-candidate.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"409\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441980000,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2687,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Knowledge Is Power. Data Isn't.","link":"knowledge-is-power-data-isnt","source_link":null,"content":"<p> How many times have you heard that &ldquo;knowledge is power?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m guessing that without much thought, you readily nod your head in agreement. In every vocation, from academics to business to politics, the knowledge theorem and its power corollary is seemingly undeniable. </p><p> <strong>  Knowledge Theorem:  Information + Knowledge = Better Decision-Making.   </strong></p><p> <strong>  Power Corollary:  Better Decision-making = Power </strong></p><p> The &ldquo;knowledge is power&rdquo; idiom was originally attributed to Francis Bacon in the late 16th century. But like many time-honored theories and beliefs, the premise isn&rsquo;t always as simple as it appears. The reason? Too much of something that is deemed &ldquo;good&rdquo; often turns out &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; Consider the meteoric rise to excessive wealth and/or stardom. While some handle their &ldquo;success&rdquo; well, others fail to realize the happiness that money and celebrity status is expected to bring. The &ldquo;too much&rdquo; concept applies to information, the first step on the stairway to power. Thanks to technology, we have access to an endless source of data at our fingertips, at any place and at any time we choose.</p><h3> Be Careful what You Wish For</h3><p> <br/> There comes a point where an insatiable thirst for knowledge does not bring power. Pass this point and information overload starts to work against you, reducing the power that you were working so hard to achieve in the first place. Here are 4 reasons why an ascending power curve flattens, and then turns downward:   </p><li> <strong>  Overwhelming amounts of information breed complexity. </strong>  Technology gives us more and more data, but analyzing and understanding &lsquo;more and more&rsquo; is arduous and time consuming. In today&rsquo;s busy world of biz, time is also power. Entrepreneurially-minded leaders who move quickly and decisively enjoy an edge. Then they build on that advantage by keeping things simple to maintain clarity.</li><li> <strong>  Information overload obstructs prudent decision-making. </strong>  When leaders rely on excessive research and information to reduce the risk of critical decisions, vibrant environments concede to morose cultures of risk-aversion. Sadly, in their race to learn more before taking that difficult choice, that other race, (the strategic race to the future), slows because stagnation sets in.</li><li> <strong>  Information doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean understanding. </strong>  Understanding comes in many shapes and forms. One of the best sources of understanding is experience, such as in-market know-how, familiarity with competitors and customers, or expertise in leading during turbulent times. Excessive information gets in the way of understanding. Less is better, strategically and managerially.</li><li> <strong>  Too much information ruins instincts. </strong>  It is experience that improves a person&rsquo;s ability to take action. Moving on your instincts is not seat-of-the-pants leadership. Rather, it is using judgment at the right time and in the right place to seize the competitive edge.  <strong>  Competitive advantage, not information, is power. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Entrepreneurial Mindset Power</h3><p> <br/> Now, I don&rsquo;t want anyone to think that I don&rsquo;t value information technology. I do. But, I&rsquo;m a disciple of point #4. When I was a CMO and CEO, I operated with an entrepreneurial mindset that required taking decisions as early as possible. That meant making the call without all of the information, and not fretting about it, but being glad of it. To be fair, the &lsquo;act early&rsquo; ethic prevails in corporate cultures that worship entrepreneurial thinking. </p><p> Not everyone or every organization can, or should operate this way. The crossing of every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and the dotting of every &ldquo;i&rdquo; is critical in hundreds of industries. None of us want to see pipelines, oil rigs, or airlines compromising safety for speed. Leaders and managers who work in these industries need all of the information. But, there is nothing stopping decision-makers from making early calls to more efficiently source the information with improved analytical acumen. </p><p> At Apple, Steve Jobs never wanted research from focus groups or quantitative usage and attitude studies. He knew what to do, and he did it with conviction. I know of no better example where experience, intuition, and instinct created power.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-10 20:31:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-10 20:31:26.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_H1GTxkY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/knowledge-is-power-data-isnt/\", \"post_id\": \"6024\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-10 20:31:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-10 20:31:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"knowledge-is-power-data-isnt\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6023\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2756\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441805983468-f5a1a9f985fb-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"673\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1441990800,"author_id":239,"chart_url":""}

You pass on investing this time, because you were emotionally conflicted and then watch it triple in value, thinking &ldquo;I knew I should have bought some.&rdquo;</p><p> Instinctively, we know purchasing individual stocks is a risky bet (especially in the short-run) but often our desire to turn our daydreams of winning the lottery in to reality is too overpowering.

The research found there is a high probability of a risk of permanent impairment when owning an individual stock. In fact, since 1980, roughly 40% of all stocks suffered a catastrophic loss, defined as a 70% loss from their peak.</p><p> For technology, biotech and metals and mining categories of the market, the chances for loss are even higher with over 50% of these holdings experiencing this level of losses.</p><p> Additionally, these types of losses don&rsquo;t happen just during recessions. While elevated losses did spike during recessions, there was still a decent percentage of loss during economic expansions.</p><h3> The Chance of Success</h3><p> <br/> If you knew you would have a less than 10 percent chance of picking an extreme winner and on average a 60% chance of extreme loss, would you be excited about the investment opportunity? Those are pretty tough odds. You can see the sector breakdown in the chart below of the percentage of stocks in the Russell 3000 index that experienced excess negative returns compared to the index in each sector over the last 34 years. The percentage of excess negative returns varied by sector, but the best case was still a 51% chance in Consumer Staples and a whopping 85% chance in Utilities. Even more surprising, your chances of finding an extreme outperformer were in the single digits with only 6-7% average odds.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/124777907@N04/15525140537\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Analysis of lifetime returns by sector\" src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3940/15525140537_7dfe12bebe_c.jpg\"/> </a></p><h3> Diversification Matters</h3><p> <br/> The reality is making decisions about individual stocks is difficult.

I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s great at helping pick insurance policies - but does that mean he has expert knowledge of estate planning?</p><p> Not so certain...Working with a relative has benefits for sure, and is a common way for many people to get financial advice.  But from what I&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s not always done in a way that results in the best outcomes. </p><p> <strong>  If you are getting financial advice from a relative, here six questions to ask yourself. </strong></p><li> <strong>  Permanence. </strong>   If I ever made a financial decision for a relative of mine that he or she ended up not being happy with, can I cope with how awkward will every major holiday will be for the rest of my life?</li><li> <strong>  Possible lack of fit. </strong>   As cited in the example above (using an uncle who is an insurance broker to write a will), sometimes we feel comfortable with people just because we know them, but in reality there are more qualified people available for the job at hand.  You should ask yourself, &ldquo;If Bob weren&rsquo;t my brother-in-law, would I still hire him to do this?&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Confidentiality.  </strong> This risk factor is best illustrated by an example.  Let&rsquo;s say that I am talk to my sister and her husband about life insurance.  During the process my sister becomes aware of a cocaine habit.  Now wouldn't you say that I stand in the middle of a big mess?  Ask yourself, &ldquo;Is there any information about me that I wouldn&rsquo;t be comfortable with this relative knowing.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Politics/Lack of Alignment.  </strong> When this gets ugly, it gets real ugly.  A few weeks ago, I met with a woman who recently had gotten married.  She was seeking life insurance for her and her husband, and decided to work with her brother.  She described an awkward conversation that she had with her in-laws who disagreed with her decision to purchase a policy that they felt was unnecessarily expensive.  So now she&rsquo;s stuck in the middle. She doesn&rsquo;t want to offend her brother by intimating that he&rsquo;s trying to take advantage of her.  But imagine what her in-laws are going to think if she buys it.  It&rsquo;s a family feud waiting to happen.  To avoid this, ask yourself, &ldquo;What are the true motivates of all parties who have an influence over this decision, and how bad could the conflict get if they clash?&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  You get what you pay for. </strong>   Sometimes working with a relative can mean reduced or no fees.  Many people would never dream of charging a relative for financial services.  As a result, you&rsquo;d be more inclined to pay them less attention than you would pay to a fee paying client, or maybe not feel as subconsciously motivated to give your relatives 100% all the time.  Before agreeing to a no fee engagement with a relative, ask yourself, &ldquo;If Bob were charging me for this, would I still hire him, or would I look for someone else better?&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Lack of process. </strong> A relative may be more inclined to skip steps, and the assumptions you make might not always be correct. I once spoke with a man who was managing investments for his entire family, although he wasn&rsquo;t a professional advisor and didn&rsquo;t really have the right credentials.  When I asked him if he filled out a risk questionnaire as part of each portfolio&rsquo;s annual review, he didn&rsquo;t even know what I was talking about.  Before you agree to work together, compare the breadth of service your relative is willing to provide against the industry standard. </li>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 14:03:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 14:03:13.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_fNUdl9S.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/questions-to-ask-when-working-with-a-relative/\", \"post_id\": \"6030\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 14:03:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 14:03:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"questions-to-ask-when-working-with-a-relative\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6029\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2760\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Questions-to-Ask-When-Working-With-a-Relative.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"542\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442235600,"author_id":424,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2690,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"LinkedIn Will NOT Increase Your Sales","link":"linkedin-will-not-increase-your-sales","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business317\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Eric Anderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://scispeak.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Scientifically Speaking  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  LinkedIn will not increase your sales. </strong> I hate to tell people this, but it&rsquo;s true. When the bottom 50% of your sales team signs up for the LinkedIn, they will probably stay in the bottom 50%. Money will not automatically rain from the sky like manna from Heaven. <strong>  If someone has poor sales skills, they will probably continue to have poor sales skills. </strong></p><p> I went to a karaoke bar once with some friends. I had all of the tools of a skilled singer: microphone, stage, trendy clothes and adoring fans (OK, even my wife laughed at me). However, when it came time to sing, all I heard were giggles and laughter. LinkedIn works the same way as the microphone: a skillful tool in the hands of a professional. It is not a &ldquo;sales panacea&rdquo; to cure all that ails a failing organization. Are you good in sales? Here is how LinkedIn can make you GREAT.</p><li> <strong>  Lead Generation </strong>  &ndash; If you are already going to networking events, picking up the phone and asking existing clients for referrals, use the Advanced Search feature in LinkedIn. Select keywords, companies and locations to target new leads. If it proves to be a fruitful search, save it. LinkedIn will send you alerts weekly or monthly. If you really want to up your game, subscribe to the Linked Sales Navigator. It will suggest leads for you based on existing clients and a desired geography.</li><li> <strong>  Engagement </strong>  &ndash; Average sales people have their internal assistant send birthday and holiday cards. Award winning sales leaders know the specific details of their clients and they act on it. Use LinkedIn to notify you when your clients have a work anniversary, change jobs, get a promotion or have a birthday. Then send a personalized note or give them a call. This may be a good time to discuss a 401(k) rollover, 529 savings plan or meeting just to check in.</li><li> <strong>  Client Management </strong>  &ndash; No other client relationship management (CRM) software tool can match the BIG DATA power of LinkedIn. Why? The clients put the information in themselves. Before any phone call or meeting, look up their information. When I was in pharmaceutical sales, I always reviewed physician information before going into the office. Great sales people never go into a discussion cold. Don&rsquo;t forget to tag your connections to make it easier to filter on specific industries, or interests.</li><li> <strong>  Process </strong>  &ndash; Here is part of the secret sauce to my sales success: I send 10 LinkedIn invitations per day. That means I send 50 per week. My analysis shows that out of 50 invitations and Inmails, I will schedule 5 meetings. Those 5 meetings will turn into 3 high value sales. With LinkedIn, my sales conversion is about 10 &ndash; 15 times higher than phone calls or emails. Similarly, it allows me to incorporate referrals into an already efficient process.</li><li> <strong>  Education  </strong> &ndash; About  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/24/how-social-media-is-reshaping-news/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   30% of US Households use Facebook to get news  </a> </u>  &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not just silly cat videos. LinkedIn is a hotbed of news activity that can be easily shared with your connections. When you find an article your audience may be interested in, share it. Similarly, use Groups to learn and participate in conversations with like minded professionals. LinkedIn allows you to market yourself as a subject matter expert in nearly any industry or field. After a year of reading and sharing, your clients will look to you as a trusted advisor and resource.</li><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2013/05/19/study-78-of-salespeople-using-social-media-outsell-their-peers/\" target=\"_blank\">   LinkedIn is the number one social media site salespeople use  </a> </u>  (followed respectively by Twitter, Facebook and blogging). However, it is just a tool to amplify existing skills. Buying a hammer and nails, does not make you a carpenter. Buying running shoes does not make you a marathon winner. Decide how you will incorporate LinkedIn into you selling strategy and work to increase connections and sales.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 14:10:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 14:10:59.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ZrEZa9U.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/linkedin-will-not-increase-your-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"6032\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 14:10:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 14:10:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"linkedin-will-not-increase-your-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6031\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2761\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-7.13.58-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"370\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442258100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2691,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Top Alternative Investments You Probably Have Never Heard Of","link":"10-top-alternative-investments-you-probably-have-never-heard-of","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kirkchisholm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kirk Chisholm  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.innovativewealth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   IAG Wealth Management  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people&rdquo; &ndash; Leo Burnett </strong></p><p> Most people are familiar with the stock market. There are TV stations which have the stock market and stock market related information on 24 hours every day. It is hard to escape it. When the stock market crashes, it makes the headlines in every newspaper, news station, and media outlet. When it reaches all time highs, it is on every magazine cover, even the shoeshine boys are talking about it. But what about other investments?</p><p> Huh? There are other investments?</p><p> Yes there are investments outside of the stock market. There is no rule that says you have to invest in the stock market, pitting yourself against the best and brightest investors in the world. Investors compound this problem by investing in areas that they are not experts in. Do you think that is a good idea?</p><p> Maybe there is a better way to invest&hellip;</p><h3> Can You Invest Outside the Stock Market?</h3><p> <br/> Peter Lynch famously said , &ldquo;Invest in what you know.&rdquo; While he was referring to stocks, the concept is sound. If you are an expert in technology then why not apply your knowledge and expertise into your investments. Invest in technology. Don&rsquo;t invest in horses, or diamond mines. That would minimize your advantage with your investments. This does not mean you should not diversify your investments, rather it means you should take advantage of your particular skill set and expertise and ply it to your investments to make good choices.</p><p> While the stock market provides investors easy access to a wide variety of companies, it is somewhat limited to publicly traded companies. These companies cover a wide range of investments: technology, timberland, transportation,  real estate, commodities,  health care, etc. , but they are still stock shares in companies run by other people.</p><p> You could also invest in bonds of these companies. This is also an investment strategy many people and institutions use to invest their capital. It is a good strategy to use, but why stop there? What else can you invest in?</p><p> There is a whole world of investments outside the stock market that individuals and institutions invest in. There are no limits to these investments except for your creativity.</p><h3> What are Alternative Investments?</h3><p> <br/> The term alternative investments requires some explanation due to its lack of definition in popular media. The term alternative investments does not actually refer to any specific group of investments. It is only a descriptive term typically used to describe investments outside the stock market. Alternative investments can also be available in the stock market, but are typically available in a pooled form. The first investment on the list is a good example of that.</p><h3> 1. Real Estate</h3><p> <br/> Real estate is probably the best known top alternative investment. You are probably already investing in real estate, but there are so many types of real estate, you may not know them all. If you own your home, then you are investing in real estate. While  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.innovativewealth.com/alternative-investment/should-you-rent-or-buy-a-home/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I would not call it an investment  </a> </u> , you certainly understand how real estate works. Real estate comes in all forms and different types, but real estate as an investment requires that you are not using it for personal use. Generally it generates cash flow, but it can also be owned for appreciation as well.</p><p> Real estate is a broad category that can refer to many different types of property, but for this example lets limit it to residential, commercial, retail, and industrial. Residential real estate is involved in living space. It generally refers to single or multifamily homes. Commercial real estate refers to larger buildings that are involved in commerce or business purposes. This includes office buildings and retail, but also can include apartment complexes. Industrial real estate refers to space involved in manufacturing and production. Examples for industrial are: garages, warehouses, shipping docks, manufacturing facilities.</p><h3> 2. Private Mortgages</h3><p> <br/> If you own your own home, then you probably have a mortgage. This is essentially a loan from the bank to you in order for you to buy your home. This is one of the primary functions of banks. However banks are not the only ones that can provide a mortgage. Anyone can do this. You could be the bank if you wanted. There are a large number of people and institutions who lend money backed by real estate and are not banks. What is even more interesting is that they are typically charge higher interest rates than banks. Why? because they are filling a consumer need that banks are not providing. I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p><p> Lets say you want to buy a piece of investment property and you can buy it for a big discount to market prices, but only if you can close on it in a week. A bank will never do this. It might take a bank 1-9 months (yes 9 months) to close on a mortgage. If you cannot get a mortgage from a bank, you will have to look elsewhere. Hence the need for alternative funding. There are a number of lenders across the country who lend backed by real estate. The rates that many of these investors require are also much higher. They might be 8-15% in addition to points. While you might scoff at the idea of paying 10% on a mortgage when the banks are paying around 4% today, if you can buy investment property for 20-30% below market price, you won&rsquo;t mind paying 10% to make this acquisition. Also once you acquire this property, there is no reason you could not refinance it with a traditional lender.</p><p> As for the private mortgage as an alternative investment, many people enjoy being the bank. It can provide a stable income while backed by an asset that is easy to understand.  The best case scenario for private mortgages as an investment: you get your rate of interest, then the principal is paid back at the end of the note.  The worst case scenario: the investor doesn&rsquo;t pay you the interest and principal back, so you have to foreclose on the property. This would mean your acquisition price of the property is what you loaned to the investor. In many cases this can be an even better outcome than just loaning the money.</p><h3> 3. Tax Liens</h3><p> <br/> Tax liens have long been one of my favorite top alternative investment types. If you are not familiar with what a tax lien is, you are not alone. I suspect that less than 5% of the population has ever heard of a tax lien as an investment. However I&rsquo;ll bet 80-100% of homeowners would understand what a tax lien is once I explain it.</p><p> If you own your home, you pay property taxes to the local town or municipality. This is one of the requirements if you own real estate. These property taxes go to pay for the operations of your town. If you don&rsquo;t pay your taxes on time, the town penalizes you at a certain rate of interest. If you have even paid your property taxes late, you will know how this works. The town benefits from this interest as well, but this is not always simple.</p><p> Lets say that you live in a state like Florida where there is a large population of &ldquo;snow birds&rdquo;. People close to or in retirement that travel down to Florida for the winter, but live in a northern state for the summer. While most people pay their taxes on time, some people forget or don&rsquo;t get around to it until well past when the taxes are due. The town still gets the benefit of the late payment interest, but most of these towns need the money now to fund their operations. If enough people don&rsquo;t pay on time, then how is a town supposed to pay their employees?</p><p> The answer is that the county or municipality holds an auction to auction off these tax liens to investors. These investors pay off the lien in full in order to be able collect the interest payments. This is a win-win for both investors and the town. This is a great deal for the investor since they can receive quite a large rate of interest (18%+) for their capital. This is a great deal for the town, because they get the funds necessary to keep the town running. I will write more about tax liens in a future post.</p><h3> 4. Private Company Stock</h3><p> <br/> While you may be familiar with investing in stocks with your brokerage account, you may not be aware that you can also invest in local private businesses. Many times businesses want to raise capital to expand their operations, or to expand their product lines. They need capital to do this. Some business owners want to sell their business to retire. This is where investors come in. If you want to invest in a business, it does not have to be listed on a publicly traded stock exchange. It can be for any business. Startups, venture capital, and private equity are just some forms of investing in private company stock.</p><p> Investing in private company stock can be a great way to productively use your capital. There are many of the same risks as with publicly traded companies, but it can also allow you to bring value to the business with your personal expertise. Some investors have been successful in a prior venture and like to invest in similar companies so they can bring their expertise and knowledge to these firms in an effort to grow their investment without being actively involved in the day to day operations.</p><h3> 5. Structured Settlements</h3><p> <br/> Have you heard of structured settlements before? You are in good company. Most people have never heard of structured settlements. In fact, even many large institutions are not familiar with this asset class. Structured settlement typically fall into 2 categories: Lottery winnings, and life insurance settlements.</p><p> Have you ever bought a lottery ticket? As long as this is not your investment strategy, you should be ok. The lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math. However people do actually win the lottery. When they win, they are given a choice, either get paid out over 20 years, or take a smaller amount up front. Many people get paid up front. The way this happens is that the lottery offers to pay the smaller amount up front. However investors also offer this winner an upfront amount (which may be greater than the lottery is offering) in exchange for the full stream of payout from the lottery itself. As a rational person, I would choose to take the larger amount over the smaller one.</p><p> Structured settlements as an investment is similar to a bond. The investor pays a lump sum amount up front, then gets paid back his interest and principal over time. Everyone gets what they want out of the transaction. While this can be a great investment strategy, it does require some understanding of how the process works, and it does take some time to complete.</p><h3> 6. Farmland</h3><p> <br/> Farmland is technically real estate, but it is also quite different in that it is also a business. There has been a lot of interest in farmland in the past 10 years and this has caused a dramatic rise in the price paid for farmland. Investors are looking at farmland as an investment because it is a renewable resource and sustainable without running out of resources. If you invest in an oil well or a gold mine, eventually you run out of the resource. With farmland, you never run out of the ability to farm on that land (withstanding some obvious risks like flooding, drought, etc).</p><p> Investors in farmland can either farm it themselves or lease it out to someone else. Either way, the investor benefits from the cash flow generated from the land. A second benefit is that the land itself should be hedged against inflation. This means that if inflation rises 2%, the price of the land should also rise 2%. The value of your capital will not lose value compared to inflation. In one of my prior posts I show a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.innovativewealth.com/alternative-investment/inflation-the-secret-to-building-wealth-in-real-estate/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   chart made from Robert Shiller&rsquo;s data  </a> </u>  that shows how inflation treats real estate. Jim Rogers, a famous hedge fund manager, has made many claims that farmers will be the next millionaires due to the need of food and value of farmland in the future. Will this be you?</p><h3> 7. Equipment Leasing</h3><p> <br/> Equipment leasing is a small but interesting investment field. I assume you have been to the dentist. well in the dentist&rsquo;s office are a number of large and expensive pieces of equipment. Most dentists cannot afford to buy this equipment outright, especially when they graduate from dental school with large school loans. They are able to get this necessary equipment by leasing it from equipment leasers. These people own the equipment and lease it to the dentist. If the dentist doesn&rsquo;t pay the lease, they can come and repossess the equipment.</p><p> Considering this as an investment it makes sense to know the equipment and the industry that uses it well. Otherwise you might get stuck with a piece of equipment that is useless to you. The benefits can be great since the yields on equipment leasing can be quite high, but just like any other investment, invest in what you know.</p><h3> 8. Oil and Gas LPs</h3><p> <br/> Most people have heard of Exxon, Conoco, Shell, and Chevron, but they have never heard of Joe Smith the oil wildcatter. While Joe is not a real person, many individuals drill for oil personally rather than in a large multinational conglomerate. Investors like Joe Smith don&rsquo;t always have money to build and maintain their oil wells, so they have to raise capital. Frequently this capital comes in the form of LPs to private investors.</p><p> Investors in oil and gas LPs have the risk of the well not hitting oil, but the benefits to them are the potential that it does hit oil as well as some decent tax benefits regardless of the outcome. This can be quite an investment strategy for the right person. These types of investment can be available through broker dealers as well as directly from the GP.</p><h3> 9. Artwork and Collectibles</h3><p> <br/> Whether or not you are an art lover, you probably have seen the news of the recent auctions held at Christie&rsquo;s for paintings valued at almost 180 million for just one painting or others valued at 40, 50, or 60 million each. Right now there is a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.innovativewealth.com/alternative-investment/top-10-ways-that-wealthy-families-protect-and-grow-their-wealth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   boom in artwork by the ultra wealthy  </a> </u> . This may have something to do with all the money that is being made in certain sectors such as finance. However you don&rsquo;t need to be an art critic or a uber-wealthy billionaire to invest in artwork or collectibles.</p><p> Artwork and collectibles include: paintings, sculpture, pottery, coins, wine, stamps, signatures, and sports or historical memorabilia. While most of us will not be bidding at the next Christie&rsquo;s auction for a Van Gogh painting, there are a number of artwork or collectible pieces that are closer to your price range. There have even been a few art or wine funds created to invest in multiple pieces without taking a large risk on just one. Artwork or collectibles as an investment has a dual purpose. It can certainly be seen as an investment, but it also has the benefit of your personal enjoyment of viewing this piece. As the saying goes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Invest in something you enjoy.</p><h3> 10. Timberland</h3><p> <br/> Timberland is also real estate related, but it has some unique characteristics that are very appealing to investors. Timberland is basically a plot of land that is growing trees. That is it. Simple right? Well not really. Owning land and harvesting trees off of it can produce some reasonable income for investors, but there are many other components to this investment. Timberland is a renewable resource. A well maintained forest is an investment that keeps on giving. while you can cut trees each year to product income, if you don&rsquo;t cut them, they will keep growing, making the wood even more valuable. This produces a predictable growth rate if they are bought at the right price. The land also appreciates and there can be some preferential tax benefits as well.</p><p> One last benefit for investors is that timberland has a very low correlation to other investments. In the early 2000s timberland had a correlation to stocks and bonds close to zero. That is hard to accomplish. However since the institutions have become interested in this as an asset, the correlations have become closer for timberland and traditional investments. The benefits are still there though. If you invest in timberland and wood prices drop, you don&rsquo;t have to cut trees, you can let them continue to grow on the stump until prices become more favorable. For these reasons timberland also makes my top 10 list.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 14:38:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 14:38:42.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_K3eq3Yi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-top-alternative-investments-you-probably-have-never-heard-of/\", \"post_id\": \"6034\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 14:38:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 14:38:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-top-alternative-investments-you-probably-have-never-heard-of\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6033\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2762\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-7.40.15-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"553\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442230200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Are you currently looking for a job, but are having problems getting interviews? Well, it&rsquo;s easy to think that your struggle is because of your age, but the truth is that your age has very little to do with the fact that you don&rsquo;t look attractive to employers. <strong>  The bigger problem could be in your resume. </strong></p><p> Follow these resume writing tips that will help make you marketable to potential employers regardless of your age:</p><h3> Your resume should be just two pages long, or even less.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  As you are already in your 40s or 50s, it is likely that you&rsquo;ve got a lot of experience already. </strong> While you might consider all your experience as highly valuable, it is important that your resume be not longer than two pages, except if you are applying for a job as an author or an executive.</p><p> According to career experts, an extremely long resume indicates that you don&rsquo;t know how to tailor your resume in a way that will highlight what is important for the job. This could mean that either you don&rsquo;t understand the job so well, or you just lack sound judgment. Hiring managers and employers may also get an idea that you are too old because of the vast work experience you&rsquo;ve got in your resume.</p><p> What you should do is select the most impressive pieces of your experience in order to come up with an effective document marketing yourself.</p><h3> There&rsquo;s no need to include all the jobs you&rsquo;ve had in your resume.</h3><p> <br/> It is best to include only the past 10 to 15 years of your jobs in your resume. This will keep the details of your resume more relevant to the position you are applying for.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t mention the graduation dates in your education.</h3><p> <br/> All you need to put in your resume is your degree, plus the school you attended. Leave out the dates you attended and your graduation year. If you have additional certifications or trainings, be sure to mention them, but again, without the dates.</p><h3> Quantify your achievements.</h3><p> <br/> One very important resume tip you shouldn&rsquo;t ignore is to quantify your achievements or accomplishments. What this means is that you need to describe your accomplishments using percentages and numbers. Take the time to think about all your achievements in each of the jobs you had in the past. How did you help improve company efficiency? How much growth in profit did you bring to the company? These figures are very attractive to employers and hiring managers, and so your resume should not lack this aspect.</p><p> No matter how old you are, you shouldn&rsquo;t think that your age is what&rsquo;s becoming a hindrance to your job search. Keep in mind that <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   career planning and pursuing a career  </a> </u> is not limited to the younger fellow only. <strong>  With the right strategy and execution of your job search plan, it is never impossible that an employer will consider having you in their team or organization. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 15:07:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 15:07:22.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_hkCQWx8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/career-planning-how-to-write-a-resume-when-you-are-in-your-50s/\", \"post_id\": \"6036\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 15:07:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 15:07:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"career-planning-how-to-write-a-resume-when-you-are-in-your-50s\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6035\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2763\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-8.09.18-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"584\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442250900,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2693,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What's In A Name?","link":"whats-in-a-name","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Can We Be Better Investors By Learning Something From Juliet and Shakespeare?</h3><p> <br/> The title of this blog is from the following line from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Romeo and Juliet.</p><p> What&rsquo;s in a name? That which we call a rose <br/> By any other name would smell as sweet; <br/> So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called</p><p> In this line, Juliet&rsquo;s lamenting the fact that her family has deemed Romeo as inappropriate based solely on the Montague name or brand. Even though Juliet has just met Romeo at this point, she is looking beyond the brand and making decisions based on her own independent valuations, not the madness of the crowds (in this case the large family feud).</p><h3> What does this have to do with investing?</h3><p> <br/> Well, just as Shakespeare gives us good investing thoughts on the importance of diversification in theMerchant of Venice when he writes</p><p> My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, <br/> Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate <br/> Upon the fortune of this present year: Therefore <br/> My merchandise makes me not sad.</p><p> Maybe in Romeo and Juliet he is telling us to not follow the emotions of the crowd or make decisions based on a brand or the perception of value.</p><p> Over the years, I have seen many investors make decisions based on the emotional power of brands. Top Wall Street houses understand this well and often employ well-healed and articulate professionals to deliver emotional pitches, prognostications and presentations.</p><p> As we have written in some previous posts, such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/preston-d-mcswain/pavlovs-brokers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pavlov&rsquo;s Brokers  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/preston-d-mcswain/if-we-had-a-chief-economist-we-would-have-to-pay-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   If We Had a Chief Economist We Would Have to Pay Them  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/preston-d-mcswain/say-it-aint-so/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Say It Ain&rsquo;t So, Joe  </a> </u>  (the names give some of the punch lines away), incentives can drive firms to sell predictions and products that sometimes do not add much value, especially after fees and taxes.</p><h3> Why do so many investors, large and small, consistently buy branded products that don&rsquo;t add much value?</h3><p> <br/> I could write a lot about psychological studies such as those discussed in behavioral finance but to keep it simple, I think it often comes down to a lack of information or in one word, transparency.</p><p> A few recent stories related to transparency prompted me to write this literary themed piece.</p><p> Over the past few months a lot of heated debate has been in the financial press about proposed fiduciary standard rules from the Department of Labor (DOL). The industry is largely up in arms about the DOL wanting to hold Wall Street firms to a higher standard of care, which would make them be more transparent and go to greater lengths to make sure that they were putting clients&rsquo; best interests first.</p><p> As I wrote in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/preston-d-mcswain/is-bad-for-business-sometimes-good/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Is Bad For Business Sometimes Good  </a> </u> , analysts are projecting that these changes might reduce the profits of some asset management firms. As would be expected when a change is proposed that might negatively impact profits or disrupt existing business models, the Wall Street lobbying machine is protesting loudly and using a lot of emotionally charged arguments to preserve the status quo. Maybe this was what got me thinking about Shakespeare because it seems appropriate for someone to say to the industry, &ldquo;Thou doth protest too much.&rdquo;</p><p> A recent Barron&rsquo;s article highlights the current rarity of investment fee transparency. In a pieced titled  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.barrons.com/articles/overpaying-for-financial-advice-1437196175\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Overpaying For Financial Advice  </a> </u> , Robert Milburn highlights information from a recent Morgan Stanley (MS) regulatory filing. It shines a bright light on what brokerage firms pay for investment products versus the fees that are charged to clients.</p><h3> To have a little fun with a Shakepeare quote, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s In A Fee?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Maybe more profit than you realize, or would be comfortable with, when you look beyond the brand.</p><p> According to the Barron&rsquo;s article, some MS clients are paying as much as 2.5% for active equity managers that only cost 0.42% (yes, a 6 X mark-up of the manager before resale).</p><p> For elite, bespoke and separately-managed fixed income portfolios (sounds good and valuable doesn&rsquo;t it?), MS is only paying the &ldquo;elite managers&rdquo; 0.23% for what is sold to clients at 2.5% (a mark-up of over 10 times).</p><h3> Think about that.</h3><p> <br/> At many brokerage and wealth management firms HNW and UHNW investors are sold what are often presented as boutique, alpha-generating separate account managers. Pitches often suggest that investors need to pay-up for valuable managers. What the Barron&rsquo;s article lays bare is that the vast majority of the fee can be going to the broker-dealer, not the &ldquo;valuable alpha manager&rdquo; (over 90% in some cases for fixed income strategies, as disclosed in the Barron&rsquo;s article).</p><p> Investors think they are paying high fees for the manager. In reality, however, they are paying high fees for the broker-dealer business platform, marketing, sales management and commissions to brokers.</p><p> Is it suitable to sell a client a product at a fee that includes a mark-up of as much as 10 times? The regulatory answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p><p> But while high mark-ups may be deemed by firms to be suitable, is it appropriate to sell clients on the idea that they are paying for one thing (alpha generating investment managers) when they are in fact paying the majority of the fee for something else (branding, marketing, sales and commissions)?</p><p> This is a bigger question and would require a much longer blog. I think it is very safe to say, however, that clients are due greater transparency in what they are actually paying for than they have currently.</p><h3> So, how does this all leave us back at Juliet?</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t be star-crossed and fall in love with a brand when entering into what can be an emotional relationship (money matters can be highly charged).</p><p> Some find comfort in established brands and nothing is wrong with businesses having solid profit margins, especially if value is being provided.</p><p> All we&rsquo;re suggesting is that, like Juliet, investors should avoid making decisions on brand alone.</p><p> Maybe someday regulations similar to the fiduciary rules being proposed by the DOL will come to pass and raise the bar for disclosures and increased transparency.</p><p> In the meantime, ask more questions about fees, business models, profit margins and incentives. If more investors demand transparency then, regardless of regulations, change will come.</p><p> <strong>  What is in a name? In the investment industry, maybe more fees and mark-ups than you think. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 15:17:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 15:17:49.000000","image_url":"uploads/2014/12/whats-in-a-name.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whats-in-a-name/\", \"post_id\": \"6038\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 15:17:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 15:17:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whats-in-a-name\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6037\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2764\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-8.16.50-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"824\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442232000,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}

Do you let your prospect take the lead, by asking if this is still a good time for them, or do you confidently and enthusiastically assume the opening and set the pace for the rest of the call?  The way you open your closing call often determines how the presentation will go, and many sales reps set themselves up for stalls by opening a closing call weakly.  <strong>  Here&rsquo;s the right way and the wrong way to open your closing calls: </strong></p><h3> The Wrong Opening #1:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Oh hi, this is _______ _______ with _________, and we had an appointment right now to go over the presentation, is this still a good time for you?&rdquo;</p><p> Now I know that it seems to make sense to check in with your prospect before just launching into your presentation, but giving them an out right at the beginning isn&rsquo;t the way to go.  When you use the opening I recommend below, if the time isn&rsquo;t right for your prospect they&rsquo;ll let you know.  But don&rsquo;t open your call by giving them an out&hellip;</p><h3> The Wrong Opening #2:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Oh hi, this is _______ _______ with _________, and I was just checking in with you to see if you needed anything today?&rdquo;</p><p> Although this may immediately sound weak to you (and it is), you&rsquo;d be shocked by how many calls I listen to that sound just this way!  This kind of opening might as well be restated as, &ldquo;Ah, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to buy anything today, would you?&rdquo;  Once again, the cure is to script out an assumptive opening that offers them a choice of products or specials as you&rsquo;ll read below.</p><h3> The Wrong Opening #3:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Hi, this is _______ _______ with _________, how are you today?&rdquo;</p><p> Nothing telegraphs a sales call more than those four overused words: &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo;  Be different!  Be engaging!  Use an opening that signals that you&rsquo;re different and that what they&rsquo;re going to experience with you is more than just a worn out sales pitch&hellip;</p><h3> The Right Opening #1:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Hi _________, this is _______ _______ with ________, how&rsquo;s your Friday going?</p><p> [Listen and react accordingly]</p><p> _________, I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to speaking with you today because I have some updates that you&rsquo;ll be particularly interested in.  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re in front of a computer, so do me a favor and go to&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> Once again, if this isn&rsquo;t a good time for your prospect (but it should be because you did send out reminder emails, right?), then they will tell you.  But the power of this opening is that you are opening with some exciting news, you&rsquo;re directing them into the presentation and you&rsquo;re taking control of the call.  And that&rsquo;s what you should always be doing.</p><h3> The Right Opening #2:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Hi _________, this is _______ _______ with ________, how&rsquo;s your Friday going?</p><p> Great!  _________, I&rsquo;m glad I reached you today, and after you hear about some of the specials we have going on today, you&rsquo;ll be glad I called.  Now the last time we spoke you told me you were (heavy users of/always on the look-out for/usually in need of&hellip;), and the good news is that today we have (X at $.....) and they are flying out the door.  How many of these could I ship out to you today?&rdquo;</p><p> Assumptive, assumptive, assumptive.  Now, are they always going to buy?  Of course not!  But when you assume the sale and lead in with a couple of specials that you know they could be interested in, and then when you ask for an order like that, those prospects who might be interested in what you have will likely take the bait and either order or begin asking you buying questions.  And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for, right?</p><h3> The Right Opening #3:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Hi _________, this is _______ _______ with ________, how&rsquo;s your Friday going?&rdquo;</p><p> Again, throw away the old, tired opening of &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo; and replace it with a different and engaging opening that anchors your prospect into the day and actually gets them thinking about how their Friday (or Monday, or Tuesday, etc.,) is actually going.  I&rsquo;ve already added it to the above two openings, and you can see how much better they flow.  By using it, y ou&rsquo;ll be building a lot more rapport by asking this, and I encourage you to try it and see for yourself how effective it is.</p><p> When you combine these openings with the requalifying scripts I wrote about earlier, you&rsquo;ll have the most effective and comprehensive opening possible.  And it&rsquo;s this type of opening that will give you the edge over your competition and get you further into a qualified presentation.  And that will equal more closed sales.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 15:25:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 15:25:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_YgoRH24.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-right-way-to-open-a-closing-call/\", \"post_id\": \"6040\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 15:25:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 15:25:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-right-way-to-open-a-closing-call\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6039\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2765\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-8.36.33-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"581\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442259900,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2695,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Parents Want for Kids","link":"what-parents-want-for-kids","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Almost all the financial decisions parents make around our kids have one thing in common: we want what's best for them. </strong> This is the case whether we're setting the amount of an allowance for an eight-year-old, helping a teenager make college choices, or deciding whether to loan adult children the money for a down payment on a house.</p><h3> Here's the problem: what we assume to be the best isn't necessarily what our kids need or want.</h3><p> <br/> Financial planner Ross Levin, who writes a monthly column for the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, addresses this question in a recent article. He describes a situation almost identical to one I have encountered with clients: parents intending to leave a vacation or family home to their adult children without first finding out whether the inheritance would be a blessing or a burden.</p><p> Levin says, \"Many clients come into our office with the unstated, but limiting, assumption that \"I want my kids to have what I have.\" This usually leads to bad decisions.\"</p><p> <strong>  I would add that this assumption is based on a second one that goes even deeper: \"I want my kids to want what I want.\" </strong></p><p> This unconscious belief can lead to expectations and actions that result in hurt feelings, resentment, and family discord. Some of these are related to major life choices: assuming children should or will take over a family business, for example, or pushing them toward careers the parents see as best for them.  </p><p> Smaller decisions can be problematic, as well. In his book <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Intentional-Wealth-Families-Stewardship-Financial/dp/1492932949/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442159597&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Intentional+wealth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Intentional Wealth  </a> </u> , counselor and coach Courtney Pullen tells the story of a successful entrepreneur who bought his son a car for his 16th birthday. Unfortunately, the car was a brand-new white Lincoln Continental. The boy's friends promptly dubbed it his \"Pimpmobile.\" The gift that represented success and value to the father was an embarrassment to the son.</p><p> An important first step toward reducing the impact of \"I want my kids to want what I want\" is recognizing that we have the belief in the first place. My suggestion? Assume that you do. It's perfectly normal. If something is important or brings satisfaction to us, it's natural to think other people will see it the same way. The problem arises when we act on that assumption instead of finding out whether it's valid.</p><p> Most of the time, the best way to find out whether someone wants what you want is simply to ask. Suppose the father in Courtney's story had talked with his son about what kind of car he might want&mdash;ideally, within some clear limits about cost, safety, and practicality. They could have shopped together to find a car the son genuinely appreciated. The experience could have created more closeness between father and son.</p><p> In the case of my clients and their home, I encouraged them to discuss the inheritance with their kids at the next family gathering. The discussion included information on the cost of upkeep and taxes, how much time the various families would be able to spend at the house, and how the shared ownership might work.</p><p> Ultimately, the siblings all agreed that they didn't want the house. The memories of family time spent there were precious to them, but those memories were primarily about the people, not the property. The relationships were more important than the place.</p><p> The parents' intent with this inheritance was clearly to provide \"the best\" for their children and grandchildren. Their goal&mdash;which the children appreciated&mdash;was to encourage continued family closeness. <strong>  The family conversation showed everyone that ownership of the house wasn't a necessary part of that goal. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 15:47:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 15:47:45.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_VQyYT8W.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-parents-want-for-kids/\", \"post_id\": \"6042\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 15:47:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 15:47:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-parents-want-for-kids\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6041\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2766\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-8.45.50-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"661\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442250000,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2697,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Team Approach To Insurance","link":"a-team-approach-to-insurance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When it comes to insurance, coordination between different financial professionals leads to a greater client experience and more efficiencies across the board. When there are multiple parties involved such as advisors, insurance experts, attorneys, trustees and CPAs the process can be grueling if each acts independently of one another.</p><p> In our experience, while the end result may be the same, the path traveled is drastically different for clients whose advisors understand coordination, and those who do not.</p><h3> Coordinating diverse professionals requires a high level of planning.</h3><p> <br/> This is especially true of the trust-owned life insurance policies we encounter.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s a look at a case study that went especially well:</h3><p> <br/> One of our advisors had a client who needed second-to-die insurance for estate planning. This policy was to be held in trust. The clients lived in one state while the trustee lived in another. There was an attorney who was drafting the new trust and the advisor who worked with us to determine the appropriate insurance.</p><p> The first call was scheduled by the advisor to include the client, our consultant and the attorney. The advisor ran the meeting efficiently, covering not only the insurance (how much they needed, what type of carriers, and what type of products), but we were also able to venture into the trusts and estates attorney&rsquo;s realm (how it would be owned, why it should be owned in trust and, how to coordinate for their children). All parties were on the same page and agreed to all decisions.</p><p> The advisor then took ownership of the process by helping to get the trust created with the attorney, all while keeping us in the loop as we dealt with the underwriting on the insurance. We were able to work with the advisor and the client to coordinate signatures for all the applications from both the clients, and the trustee. We also worked with the advisor to coordinate the setup of a trust account, and schedule premium payments to coincide with the policy being issued.</p><p> All of this work fell to the advisors, without the client having to attend multiple meetings or go through exhaustive work. For them, it was effortless. This is not always the case. Many times, advisors are less involved and allow the client to work independently with the insurance professional, CPA and attorneys. The end result can be conflicting recommendations, multiple meetings and additional, unexpected paperwork. These avoidable pitfalls are one of the reasons clients have an unfavorable experience with insurance.</p><p> <strong>  How are you helping coordinate your client&rsquo;s advisors?

{"original_id":2698,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Tips to Successfully Plan For Your Client's Longevity","link":"three-tips-to-successfully-plan-for-your-clients-longevity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Here&rsquo;s a real dilemma for a wealthy 87 year old woman whose situation is secure but it is causing family conflict. <strong>  She needs full time care long term. </strong></p><p> Her financial advisor, together with the bank trustee managing her assets used calculation tools to figure out how to make her assets last for her lifetime. Somehow, they failed to anticipate the actual cost of caring for an elder with physical conditions and illnesses that require 24/7 care. This is a woman with advanced cardiac disease who had open heart surgery. Her daughter, who is a professional, left her self-employment to care for her mother full time.</p><h3> The caregiving daughter wants some compensation from mom&rsquo;s millions. She indeed deserves it.</h3><p> <br/> Further, the life expectancy the trustee and advisor chose as a basis for determining how long her assets would have to last was 100 years of age. Given her medical issues, no doctor treating her would agree with that estimate. Far from it. She may have another two years or so but it is very unlikely that she could live to be 100. Her heart is simply wearing out.</p><p> While cash is being drawn down monthly for her essential expenses for care at her daughter&rsquo;s home, no one calculated the cost to her daughter, who is losing a six-figure income in providing the needed care. Being with her daughter is the mother&rsquo;s preference. And her daughter is taking excellent care of her.</p><p> The brother, who is eager to get his &ldquo;share&rdquo; of an inheritance is hovering around the trustee, demanding to know how much is being spent to care for mom and why the caregiving sister should get compensation to make up for her losses, even partially. He resents his sister for asking for compensation for caregiving.</p><p> <strong>  What could you, as an advisor do to prevent or mitigate family conflict like this when planning for an aging client&rsquo;s future? Here are some tips: </strong></p><li> <strong>  When using tools to calculate life expectancy, take into consideration your client&rsquo;s medical condition. </strong> Get real data from your client or from involved family. And update your information and calculations as age takes its toll. Health generally declines in old age.</li><li> <strong>  Take into consideration that about 70% of people today will need long term care at some point. </strong> In the client&rsquo;s case described above, the minimum cost of care for her is $12,000 a month. That does not include bookkeeping, a driver, nor medication management. That figure covers a full time, 24/7 non-medical home care worker only.</li><li> <strong>  Assume that if your client has adult children willing to provide care, a wealthy client can and should compensate the caregiving adult child.  </strong> What is &ldquo;fair&rdquo; should be based on market rates for service provided and the cost of what the adult child has to give up, such as quitting a job. <br/>  </li><p> Calculation models may be inadequate to build in these details.

{"original_id":2699,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Ways to Improve Your Brand's Credibility & Trust","link":"4-ways-to-improve-your-brands-credibility-trust","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;When price and availability are no longer sufficient advantages (because everything is available and the price is no longer news), then what we are drawn to is the vulnerability and transparency that bring us together, that turn the &ldquo;other&rdquo; into one of us&hellip;.The people you seek to lead, the people who are helping to define the next thing and the interesting frontier, these people want your humanity, not your discounts.&rdquo; These words from marketing legend  <u>  Seth Godin </u>  highlight the fact that there is a fundamental disconnect between the way we have historically built and marketed our businesses and what our customers truly care about. As a result, most businesses are lost in a sea of sameness, spending money on advertising that doesn&rsquo;t resonate and messages that will never connect.</p><p> To overcome this disconnect, our customers must trust us more, find us to be the most credible option to ensure we are sufficiently differentiated and elevated from the competition.</p><p> <strong>  Here are four ways to improve your brand&rsquo;s credibility and trust: </strong></p><h3> Be Vulnerable</h3><p> <br/> In her landmark book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Vulnerable-Transforms-ebook/dp/B007P7HRS4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370378978&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daring+greatly\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Daring Greatly  </a> </u> , Dr. Bren&eacute; Brown, a renowned expert on vulnerability, defines vulnerability as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.  <u>  <a href=\"http://brandforging.co/jenis-splendid-ice-creams-4-crisis-lessons-from-a-purpose-driven-brand/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   When Jeni&rsquo;s Splendid Ice Creams  </a> </u>  discovered Listeria in their production facility, they didn&rsquo;t hide the fact, they didn&rsquo;t play it down and they didn&rsquo;t take any chances when it came to removing the risk. This vulnerability allowed their community and customers to rally around them and cheer for their return. As humans, we seek out not just the people that we feel like our values align with, but the companies that live up to similar values. A willingness to be vulnerable puts the humanity back in the business, allowing for mistakes to be forgiven and missteps to be overlooked in favor of the greater effort and purpose.</p><h3> Be Transparent</h3><p> <br/> Consumers are demanding transparency from the brands they buy from. Whether it be a desire to know all of the ingredients in the processed food they buy to the working conditions enjoyed by the staff, consumers increasingly want the brands to live up to the standards they themselves value. Brands such as Chipotle, Whole Foods and Patagonia have made transparency the foundation of their business. Rick Ridgeway, the VP for Environmental Initiatives had this to say in an interview with Fast Company: &ldquo;We wanted to figure out how better to communicate our sustainability efforts to our customers. We didn&rsquo;t just want to make an annual standard CSR report. It just didn&rsquo;t feel like us. So we were trying to figure out what we could do, when we had this idea to go into our supply chain and make videos that a customer could see when they come into our website and find out what the real origins were of their jacket or T-shirt, going all the way back to the farm where the cotton was grown and ending up at the warehouse where the product finally ends up. They can see slideshows, videos and interviews of the people behind the product. But more importantly, these slides, videos, and interviews discuss what is good about the product and what sucks. It&rsquo;s the good and the bad. It&rsquo;s total transparency.&rdquo;</p><h3> Engage</h3><p> <br/> In Gensler&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gensler.com/design-thinking/research/2013-brand-engagement-survey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2013 Brand Engagement Study  </a> </u>  they found the following outcome: &ldquo;We believe that engagement is more emotional and rooted in the personal relationships, aspirations, values and motivations of consumers, and that the more a brand acknowledges and aligns with those priorities, the deeper engagement can be.&rdquo; Practically, engagement can be fostered by communicating transparently with customers when they have questions on social media channels, developing products and services that truly align with the priorities of customers and finding creative and meaningful ways to develop emotional connections with customers.</p><h3> Get Certified</h3><p> <br/> Certification has been used by brands for years to help benchmark processes and systems. Certifications such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_9000\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ISO 9000  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma\" target=\"_blank\">   Six Sigma  </a> </u>  have been the mark of a quality-driven organization. More recently we have seen  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fairtradeusa.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fair Trade  </a> </u>  develop a certification for sustainable coffee bean growing and supply and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usgbc.org/leed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LEED  </a> </u>  for green building leadership in the construction industry. These certifications and seals of approval from industry bodies build trust and credibility. While the certifications mentioned addressed certain parts of a business or processes, they do not deal with an entire business. This is where  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   B Corp certification  </a> </u>  has found a niche. B Corp certification  is a private certification issued to for-profit companies by  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Lab\" target=\"_blank\">   B Lab  </a> </u> , a global non-profit organization. To be granted and to preserve certification, companies must receive a minimum score on an online assessment for &ldquo;social and environmental performance&rdquo; and satisfy the requirement that the company integrate B Lab commitments to stakeholders into company governing documents, thereby demonstrating their true purpose and commitments to their stakeholders.</p><p> In a world where brand noise is only getting louder, finding a way to sing your beautiful song and be heard has never been more important.

Have you stopped and asked yourself, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my firm&rsquo;s hook?&rdquo; Answering this question is the first step in differentiating your business from the competition. <strong>  As you set out to define your firm&rsquo;s narrative and make your mark on the industry, consider these strategies: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Determine what qualities are unique to your firm and what services you excel at delivering. </strong>  This is the essential building block for your firm&rsquo;s narrative. One of my college professors always told me when in doubt, follow this rule: &ldquo;Keep it simple, stupid.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t overcomplicate things, stay true to what makes your firm better than the rest. Your firm&rsquo;s mission statement is a great place to start. Evaluate your mission, keeping in mind today&rsquo;s evolving marketplace, and determine the offerings that are exclusive, or why a potential client should choose your firm over the competitor. You want to position your company as the best, so you may need to refresh your brand personality to really stand out.</li><li> <strong>  Hone in on your audience. The first rule of successful communication: know your audience. </strong> Who are you trying to reach? At times, this may vary &ndash; for example, the majority of your clients are baby boomers, but you are starting to market more to millennials and need collateral that connects with both groups. How one generation communicates compared to the next may alter. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you change your voice or narrative &ndash; it&rsquo;s about crafting your communication to showcase what&rsquo;s important to that particular audience.</li><li> <strong>  Finesse messaging.  </strong> This is an ongoing process, but core messages should remain the same and be a foundation for all of your communications. Every time you communicate on behalf of your firm, the messaging needs to feel fresh &ndash; taking the current environment into consideration &ndash; while still tying back to what makes your story sing, your hook.</li><li> <strong>  Go beyond your own news for a hook to tell your story. </strong> Your firm launching a new product or service line is certainly news, but this doesn&rsquo;t happen every day. Stay on top of current events and weave in your own hook appropriately. Have your CEO position himself as a thought leader by weighing in on industry issues and trends, and how the company is specially positioned; a great way to achieve this is via a blog. Some points to remember: Timeliness &ndash; capitalizing on recent news. Proximity &ndash; if it&rsquo;s a local audience you&rsquo;re targeting, how do you relate to them? Significance &ndash; who does this news affect and what is it saying?</li>Remember, you invite people in to learn your firm&rsquo;s story by giving them a hook &ndash;<strong> a taste of what you are about</strong>&ndash; and a key ingredient for doing that is utilizing news and what is currently happening in the marketplace, while tying in your narrative to relevant audiences. The above strategies are just a starting point for learning how to identify and deliver your hook. With the ever-changing landscape of the media, digital communication and clients&rsquo; needs, these strategies will become more and more important to implement.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 18:33:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 18:33:42.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_4jKmMDV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/build-your-pr-momentum-whats-your-ria-firms-hook/\", \"post_id\": \"6052\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 18:33:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 18:33:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"build-your-pr-momentum-whats-your-ria-firms-hook\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6051\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2771\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-11.40.57-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"553\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442233800,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2701,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Feuding Employees: 5 Practical Tips For Managing Employee Conflict","link":"feuding-employees-5-practical-tips-for-managing-employee-conflict","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Sometimes the hardest part of a job isn&rsquo;t even doing the job itself, but rather dealing with the difficult people all around. </strong> Employees who don&rsquo;t get along, or are moody and combative, can make a hostile environment for everyone. The reasons for employee feuds are numerous, and can vary from something as seemingly small as differences in opinion on the coffee order to more major things such as distribution of responsibilities or power struggles.</p><p> It is impossible to completely avoid employee disputes and disagreements in even the best of work environments; personalities, habits, principles and personal values differ from one individual to another, so some employees will naturally &ldquo;click&rdquo;, whereas others will have a hard time interacting and collaborating with each other. While the conflicts can prove unsettling, in some cases employee disputes are not entirely bad for a workplace. Groups of like-minded people or those employees who always strive to achieve a consensus in every situation can be vulnerable to  <u>  <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/gindex/g/groupthink.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   groupthink  </a> </u> , which can negatively affect a group&rsquo;s productivity and decision-making processes. Well-handled employee conflict can even work as a great stimulant for employee creativity, motivation and competitive drive, as it pushes people out of their comfort zones and forces dialogue to reach better decisions.</p><p> That said, the line between a conflict as a positive experience and one where people never speak again is somewhat thin. A minor disagreement can escalate into a major feud in no time, given the &ldquo;right&rdquo; conditions and contrasting personalities. Disorganized teams, long work hours, overcrowded or open work spaces, and drama-prone coworkers who are all too often eager to add some fuel to the flames, can complicate and exacerbate the conflict, prompting the conflicting parties&rsquo; emotions to get the best of them.</p><p> Even if you aren&rsquo;t in the thick of it, being around unchecked conflict can be stressful and distracting. When employee conflict gets out of hand, it hurts everyone in the vicinity:</p><h3> Divided workforce</h3><p> Workplace conflict is like a force field pulling in everything that surrounds it. If given enough time, the whole office will become involved in the brawl, taking sides and defending positions. The more people are involved the more challenging it is to deescalate the situation and find a resolution to it. A divided workforce is sure to undermine the teamwork that previously existed in the office and which probably took a considerable amount of time and effort to establish.</p><h3> Increased turnover and loss of key employees</h3><p> If a conflict between feuding employees becomes so intense that even management&rsquo;s involvement cannot remedy it, a company&rsquo;s Human Resources department might have to be engaged to help relocate or discharge certain people. On the other hand, some employees might quit their jobs, finding the work environment too toxic for their emotional wellbeing.</p><h3> Diminished trust in leadership</h3><p> If a feud has been left unattended and allowed to continue to fester for an extended period of time, the ability of a manager in charge to lead might be called into question by his/her subordinates and bosses. Some may interpret the manager&rsquo;s approach, or lack thereof, to the problem as ineffective or even negligent, and begin to circulate comments that cast doubt on the manager&rsquo;s willingness and ability to properly do his/her job. This may negatively affect the manager&rsquo;s reputation, compensation and even position in a company.</p><h3> Loss of productivity</h3><p> Conflicts are incredibly disruptive &ndash; instead of putting all that time and energy into their work, the warring employees spend the office hours on bickering, gossiping, retaliating and even sabotaging one another. One study found that U.S.  <a href=\"http://img.en25.com/Web/CPP/Conflict_report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employees spent 2.8 hours a week handling conflict </a> , which totals to approximately a $2,614 loss per employee per year, based on average hourly earnings of $17.95. Employees who are not directly involved in a dispute may also become less productive for a number of reasons. For example, employees who find their managers unreliable and untrustworthy are less motivated than those employees who have strong trust in the management&rsquo;s leadership. Motivation and productivity are directly correlated, and so a  <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/you-are-only-as-strong-as-your-weakest-link-motivation-a-driving-force-behind-employee-productivity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  decline in motivation will result in a corresponding drop in productivity </a> .</p><h3> Negative publicity</h3><p> There is no guarantee that internal conflict will remain confined inside the company&rsquo;s walls; feuding employees might take their frustrations and grievances to social media, letting everyone, including the company&rsquo;s customers, competitors and investors, know about what is happening.</p><p> Since every situation is different, there is no foolproof set of instructions that would work every time for everyone. Many factors need to be accounted for when dealing with employee disputes, including company regulations and culture, unique personal circumstances and conflicting personalities, among others. The following are, however, a few pieces of practicable advice that can help managers lay the groundwork for not only resolving conflicts but also preventing minor disagreements from developing into more serious cases.</p><p> <strong>  1. Create a framework for dealing with conflict.  </strong> Preventing conflicts is much easier and more desirable than having to manage them. Most people naturally don&rsquo;t like confrontation and would prefer to have some guidance for handling it the right way. Oftentimes, companies&rsquo; employee handbooks don&rsquo;t adequately cover the issue of employee conflict, and many companies have no written code of conduct. If this is the case in your office, then consider spearheading an effort to establish the framework for managing disputes. You can easily give your team members such a framework in the form of the 5-step SHIFT model that is based on the following steps:</p><li> Have each &ldquo;side&rdquo; or person specify the desired outcome &ndash; &ldquo;To end the dispute&rdquo; is too general a statement. &ldquo;To resolve the conflict&rdquo; is slightly better, yet still not specific enough. What does the resolution imply? What are the means to finding a working solution? Questions like these must be answered, and both quantitative and qualitative aspects accounted for, in order to define the desired outcome;</li><li> Get the warring factions to highlight and categorize the obstacles &ndash; not including each other; these are the major impediments that your employees need to overcome in order to achieve their desired outcome. They will soon discover that some obstacles &ndash; personal beliefs and personality traits, for example &ndash; cannot be controlled, and that trying to manipulate them will yield no result; instead, if employees view the obstacles objectively perhaps they can turn their focus to the obstacles that they can control or influence for tactical solving of the problem;</li><li> Identify the human factor &ndash; these are the stakeholders in a conflict, and they can be classified into four major categories based on the amount of their interest in the conflict and power to influence the conflicting parties. This step can help employees realize the impact of their dissent on others;</li><li> Brainstorm the possible alternatives &ndash; in order to find the best solution to the problem, your employees need to define as many alternatives as they can think of first, while relying on the case-specific criteria that they also need to define for themselves. Then, by evaluating the alternatives and eliminating the least suitable options, they will be able at arrive to the one that can be used for resolving the conflict;</li><li> Define the specific next steps and take disciplined action &ndash; this last, and extremely important, step in the SHIFT model highlights the steps that employees must take to dissolve their conflict. This is where, once an agreement on some alternative is reached, each party needs to create a general step-by-step implementation plan with assignments for each one. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Avoid &ldquo;taking sides.&rdquo; </strong>  The truth is that you may align with one party more than the other; however, trying to get in the middle by promoting one&rsquo;s case to the other is a dangerous affair. This may, in fact, be interpreted as favoritism by other employees and have an adverse effect on your reputation and credibility. Your job is to be objective and impartial, even if you support one party&rsquo;s position and not the other&rsquo;s.</p><p> <strong>  3. Refrain from playing mediator. </strong>  As a manager, you want your employees to be able to cope with their disputes independently. This doesn&rsquo;t mean, though, that you should ignore the conflict &ndash; quite the contrary; you need to acknowledge that an issue exists and encourage the disagreeing parties to resolve it as soon as possible. Employee self-efficiency is the goal: you don&rsquo;t want your employees to come running to you every time something happens, you need to give them the tools to work things out on their own.</p><p> <strong>  4. Promote communication. </strong>  You must let the disputing parties know that their feud will not be tolerated because of the negative impact that it makes on the team&rsquo;s morale, motivation and productivity. With that message, pay for and send them to have a lunch or coffee together and find a resolution to their problem by working together through the SHIFT framework. Encourage them to get out of the office and talk about their difficulties on a neutral ground.</p><p> <strong>  5. Model collaborative behavior.  </strong> As a manager, you need to promote an environment of professionalism, civility and respect among the employees, no matter the issue or its emotional intensity. Inappropriate behavior should not only be discouraged but penalized in order to prevent it from happening again in the future. You should be your employees&rsquo; role model and act like it at all times, so make sure you and other team members are not gossiping, bad-mouthing or otherwise fomenting conflicts in the office.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 18:45:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 18:45:30.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ZyUz9ol.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/feuding-employees-5-practical-tips-for-managing-employee-conflict/\", \"post_id\": \"6054\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 18:45:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 18:45:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"feuding-employees-5-practical-tips-for-managing-employee-conflict\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6053\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2772\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-11.55.43-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442242800,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

To many, having a strong currency might sound like a good thing, and in many respects it is. The dollar&rsquo;s relative strength is a reflection of the U.S. economy, which continues to improve since the financial crisis.</p><p> <img alt=\"US Dollar Up 20 Percent Since July 2014\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/FT-US-Dollar-Up-20-Percent-Since-July-2014-09102015.png\"/></p><p> <strong>  While a strong dollar might be good for national pride, it&rsquo;s been a major headache for multinational American companies. </strong> The most cited reason for subpar second quarter earnings, in fact, is the greenback. Financial number-cruncher firm FactSet noted in a recent report that the impact of the strong dollar was a recurring theme in many earnings reports, from Nike to Costco to AutoZone.</p><p> The reason? A strong currency makes U.S. exports and products more expensive to other countries, which might encourage them to switch suppliers. It also means that the value of overseas sales is reduced when it&rsquo;s converted back into dollars.</p><p> In the last year, many countries and regions&mdash;including Europe, Japan and, most recently,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/china-not-immune-to-contagious-quantitative-easing-and-massive-printing-of-cheap-money/#.VfGRipc0O3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   China  </a> </u> &mdash;have devalued their currencies, making their export prices more attractive to foreign buyers. The Colombian peso is down 23 percent against the dollar; the Turkish lira, 20 percent. The Brazilian real has lost close to 30 percent this year.</p><p> In the chart below, you can see the huge difference in second quarter earnings and revenue growth between S&amp;P 500 companies that conduct less than half of their business within the U.S. and those that mostly focus outside the U.S.</p><p> <img alt=\"The Strong US Dollar Negatively Affected SP-500 Companies Earnings\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/FT-The-Strong-US-Dollar-Negatively-Affected-SP-500-Companies-Earnings-an....png\"/></p><p> From materials to information technology to consumer discretionary, no sector is immune. The only way to avoid the pitfalls of unfavorable foreign exchange rates is to restrict business to the U.S., an idea most growth-seeking companies wouldn&rsquo;t entertain. Even if business were to remain stateside, revenue could still be hurt by a lack of foreign tourists, since a strong local currency makes travel and shopping more expensive for them.</p><p> Luxury jeweler Tiffancy &amp; Co., for one, is well aware of this fact.</p><h3> Tiffany</h3><p> <br/> About a quarter of Tiffany&rsquo;s total sales come from foreign markets, meaning the exchange rate has lately nibbled at earnings. Even though the company reported increased quarterly sales at international stores, profits fell 15 percent, from $124.1 million a year ago to $104.9 million. Tiffany is also seeing a marked decline in tourist shoppers to its flagship Fifth Avenue store this year because the dollar has made it more expensive to visit the U.S.</p><h3> Macy&rsquo;s</h3><p> <br/> New York-based department store chain Macy&rsquo;s has also been hit by the strong dollar, resulting in lower overseas profits and fewer tourist visitors. Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet even reported that the company&rsquo;s worst performance, geographically, was in its major tourist markets. To counter flat year-over-year revenue growth, Macy&rsquo;s will be closing 35 to 40 of its stores in early 2016, saving it some $300 million.</p><h3> Walmart</h3><p> <br/> Macy&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t the only department store that&rsquo;s felt the negative effects of a stronger greenback. Walmart, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant, reported first-quarter revenue of $114 billion, down 0.1 percent from the same quarter the previous year. According to the store, global currency fluctuations were responsible for a loss of $3.3 billion in net sales. Another issue affecting revenue right now is Walmart&rsquo;s decision to raise its minimum wage to $9 an hour.</p><h3> Ford</h3><p> <br/> Few companies are as American as Ford. Founded by Henry Ford in 1903, the Michigan-based automaker is known for its iconic brands such as the Mustang, Thunderbird and F-Series line of pickup trucks. Among the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; American automakers, which also includes General Motors and Chrysler, Ford was the only one not to be bailed out by the U.S. government in 2009. But in the first quarter, revenue dropped about $2 billion from the same time a year ago. Seventy percent of that drop, according to the company, was due to the effects of exchange rates.</p><h3> Yum! Brands</h3><p> <br/> If you haven&rsquo;t heard of Yum! Brands, you might be more familiar with its ubiquitous fast food franchises KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. In recent years, Yum! has established a strong presence in dozens of foreign markets, including Canada, Japan, Australia and Malaysia&mdash;countries whose currencies have fallen this year against the dollar. In China, where the company operates 6,400 locations, sales declined by 4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter because of the strong dollar.</p><p> In its earnings report, the company stated that &ldquo;foreign currency translation remains a strong headwind&rdquo; and that it expected the exchange rate &ldquo;to impact full year EPS (earnings per share) by about 5 percentage points.&rdquo;</p><h3> Johnson &amp; Johnson</h3><p> <br/> Maker of iconic American brands Band-Aid, Tylenol and Neutrogena, as well as many important pharmaceuticals and medical devices, Johnson &amp; Johnson has recently benefited from the acquisition of biopharmaceutical firms Alios and Covagen. But because of wide exposure abroad, the New Jersey-based company reported sharply lower sales in the second quarter.</p><h3> Procter &amp; Gamble</h3><p> <br/> Procter &amp; Gamble is the world&rsquo;s largest consumer products maker, known for its hugely popular billion-dollar brands Tide, Pampers, Crest, Folgers and many more. The Cincinnati-based company gets nearly two thirds of its revenue from foreign markets and maintains operations in more than 80 countries around the globe. The second quarter of 2015, however, was P&amp;G&rsquo;s sixth consecutive fall in quarterly sales, with more than $4.6 billion erased by foreign exchange rates. Like many multinationals, the company has been forced to raise prices in foreign markets to offset the effects of the dollar, which has only led to further declines.</p><h3> U.S. Steel</h3><p> <br/> At one time, the United States Steel Corporation, known commonly as U.S. Steel, was the largest corporation in the world, and the first to be capitalized at more than a billion dollars. Today the Pittsburgh-based company is worth just under $2.5 billion and is facing serious headwinds, as the strong dollar has made steel exports from Brazil, Russia and China&mdash;the world&rsquo;s largest producer&mdash;much more competitive. As a result, U.S. Steel lost money in the first two quarters of 2015 and has had to lay off over 1,700 workers.</p><p> These are only a sampling of companies that have been hurt by the strong dollar and unfavorable exchange rates. By no means are they the only ones.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important for investors to think long-term. Although it might not happen tomorrow, the dollar will eventually decline against other world currencies, helping to give American companies a more competitive edge.</p><p> In the meantime, consider the rest of the world on sale. Traveling to Europe, for instance, is now much more affordable for American tourists. Although the strong dollar might have hurt the bottom line of many multinationals, the real winners in all of this are the everyday American consumer.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-13 19:01:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-13 19:01:10.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_pEpP1JQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-iconic-american-companies-that-have-been-hurt-by-the-strong-dollar/\", \"post_id\": \"6056\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-13 19:01:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-13 19:01:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-iconic-american-companies-that-have-been-hurt-by-the-strong-dollar\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6055\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2773\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-13-at-12.07.38-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"605\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442239200,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

Even his supervisor walked a few paces behind him because Richard looked the part&mdash;he absolutely oozed sophistication, confidence, and success. </strong></p><p> He gave me this very important bit of advice early in my career: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you do, it is how you look doing it. From the way you look, to how you think about this organization, to the way you speak and represent yourself to the public.&rdquo;</p><p> Some people, like Richard, command respect, admiration, and loyalty. They exude the qualities of both confidence and competence&mdash;and one thing I&rsquo;ve learned is that those two always travel in pairs. </p><p> If you are competent, you will be confident. If you are not competent, no matter how confident you try appear you know you&rsquo;re an empty suit and full of bullsh*t. It will only be a matter of time before you&rsquo;re found out.</p><p> And have you noticed&mdash;the person who is the most respected is also the most successful! </p><p> Mental toughness boils down to the way we think. If we think we can accomplish a thing, we can. It is harnessing the power of our mind to break through our barriers and accomplish our goals. </p><p> If you believe your are inferior, you are&mdash;regardless of your qualifications. The way we think affects our behavior, and this is the essence of mental toughness: </p><p> Manage your thoughts, emotions, and behavior in ways that set you up for success.</p><p> How you think determines how you act.</p><p> How you act determines how others react to you.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at how you can use the way you think, feel, and behave to impress anyone&mdash;even your boss:</p><h3> 1. Look Important</h3><p> <br/> Call it shallow but Richard was right: it&rsquo;s not what you do, it&rsquo;s how you look doing it.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are a man or a woman, don&rsquo;t leave the house without your polish. Spend that extra amount of time to make sure you are sending the message you really want to send.</p><p> Having spent hours on surveillance, I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing: FBI agents can usually spot a criminal just by looking at them. It may not be fair, but it&rsquo;s a fact: the way you dress, comb your hair, and carry yourself speaks volumes about how you feel about yourself.</p><p> Before you step out the door, ask yourself how your colleagues, competitors, and neighbors see you. What do they think about you, based on your appearance?</p><p> And yes, I already know that intellect should be the criteria upon which we judge a person. In theory, this is true. But this is the real world of hard knocks where you can lose a promotion, a relationship, or a chance to take on new project simply on the basis of how you come across to others.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t already figured it out, first impressions may be the only impression you&rsquo;ll ever make. And they stick in the mind of the other person because it is the only criteria they have for evaluating you.</p><p> You are what you think you are. Do not ever think small, so start with the first thing first&mdash;your appearance.</p><h3> 2. Think Important</h3><p> <br/> My career before the FBI was a department store manager at a large retail chain. It was a brutal and thankless job, and many of my colleagues moped around like the walking dead during the holiday season.</p><p> If asked what they did for a living, Irma would say, &ldquo;I persuade women to buy polka dot blouses instead of striped ones this season.&rdquo; Edith would reply with, &ldquo;I work long hours and get paid minimum wage.&rdquo;</p><p> When I was interviewed by the FBI, I answered that question by saying, &ldquo;I am helping to build the country&rsquo;s largest retail chain.&rdquo;</p><p> Attitude is everything. If you think that you, and your work, is important, it will be. That sort of attitude is both inspiring and infectious. </p><p> The way we think tells others a lot about our potential for responsibility. There is an amazing correlation between a person&rsquo;s job attitude and their job performance.</p><p> Do not think of your present job, even if it isn&rsquo;t perfect, as a necessary evil. Instead, think on a broader scale. Make suggestions for ways to grow the business. Look at time in the C-suite as opportunities to learn and soak in the attitude and thinking of others who are more successful. </p><p> Your thoughts have incredible power. Be mentally tough and channel those thoughts into power horses. </p><p> The key to success is thinking positively about yourself and your contribution to the job. Enthusiasm is contagious, so be that germ that spreads first-class performance. </p><h3> 3. Speak Important</h3><p> <br/> The words you use are important. They have a lot of power because they energize our thoughts. Words are thoughts spoken out loud. The words we say to ourselves can either inspire or destroy, depending on what our brain hears.</p><p> When you think you can&rsquo;t accomplish a goal and want to quit, your brain puts barriers around achieving the goal; often these are no more than self-limiting barriers because you&rsquo;ve told yourself you can&rsquo;t do it. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J863EO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=spacforrent-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001J863EO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research  </a> </u>  estimates that we say 300-1,000 words to ourselves per minute. So teach yourself to react positively to your circumstances so you can override the anxiety that can come from negative thinking. </p><p> Positive self-talk can shift the way you see your stressors. It can help you become more flexible in the face of change and uncertainty. Mental toughness is recognizing that even in the roughest circumstances, we are never helpless.</p><p> What sort of impression do you think you make on others?</p> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 18:21:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 18:21:26.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_0VtjvPY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-use-mental-toughness-to-impress-anyone-even-your-boss/\", \"post_id\": \"6058\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 18:21:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 18:21:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-use-mental-toughness-to-impress-anyone-even-your-boss\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6057\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2774\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442128788708-15f1811dd622.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"286\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442325600,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2704,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Escaping The Grief Of Financial Disaster","link":"escaping-the-grief-of-financial-disaster","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Sarah and Peter&rsquo;s financial life was a disaster. They graduated from college with a mound of debt. Then in a whirlwind of trying to get their life together off the ground, put themselves further in debt, burning their credit cards right up to the max. Their earnings weren&rsquo;t matching the trajectory they had expected and the result was devastating. </p><p> Jim and Carol&mdash;in their 50&rsquo;s&mdash;decided to buy that lake house they&rsquo;d been dreaming about for years. They had saved enough for a down payment and financed the rest. They calculated their monthly carrying costs and felt they could swing it without too much difficulty. They didn&rsquo;t expect that Jim would lose his job. Suddenly, they were caught with more expenses than they could handle and panic was about to set in.</p><p> Judy and Sid, a couple in their mid-70&rsquo;s, thought they would live out their lives in comfort. Their expenses were reasonable and between Social Security, her small teacher&rsquo;s pension and the savings they&rsquo;d accumulated, they felt pretty good. That was until Judy was afflicted with dementia and she needed care beyond what Sid could provide at home. Sid, being in good health, was still active and independent, but the cost of maintaining Judy in the nursing home was breaking the bank quickly. Sid became desperate. </p><p> These examples are not outliers, but real situations that happen through unexpected life events. When financial strife hits, we are left in panic, despair and devastation. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a path to a comfortable solution. Dread and depression become partners with despair and devastation. We can sit in self-blame, self-pity or denial&mdash;or recognize that the only way out is through positive action. It starts with three mindset shifts:</p><p> <strong>  Stop the blame. </strong>  Nothing is solved while blame is being spread around.</p><p> <strong>  Avoid the self-pity. </strong>  It is a downward spiral of defeat.&rdquo; Oh woe is me&rdquo; is not a solution.</p><p> <strong>  Deny denial. </strong>  Burying your head deeper in the ground is going to give you nothing more than a mouthful of dirt.</p><p> Taking serious action is the way&mdash;the only way&mdash;through these painful situations.</p><p> You want to know the facts. Understand your current financial situation clearly and understand whether your money mindset led to the problem.</p><p> There are always options and you want to explore them. Start capturing possibilities to get you out of the muck.</p><p> Seek help and support. You might need the help of a financial planner, attorney, CPA, therapist and/or social worker. There is zero shame in asking for the help you need.</p><p> Consider whether your money mindset is the first issue that needs to be addressed and what new beliefs need to replace them in order for you to navigate the challenges ahead. Depending on your situation, you might need to start off working with a therapist so that you have the emotional tools necessary to navigate the rest. Money problems can be an offshoot of your money mindset&mdash;your money beliefs that you acquired in childhood.

{"original_id":2705,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Social Security Disability - \"Ticket to Work\"","link":"social-security-disability-ticket-to-work","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a social security retirement income specialist, one of the areas I end up having to address on a surprisingly regular basis is social security disability income (SSDI) benefits. I have blogged on this topic previously but with this October being \"National Disability Employment Awareness Month\" I thought it would be worthwhile to highlight some of the little known programs and benefits available through the social security disability system. <br/> <br/> Before I begin I think it's important to state that the social security disability program is probably the most misunderstood program in the social security system. There is often a perception that SSDI recipients have never worked and are taking advantage of the system for minor impairments, if not by outright fraud. Certainly there have been issues regarding fraudulent benefits, similar to those experienced by commercial disability insurance carriers, but for the most part SSDI claims are being paid to worthy and eligible beneficiaries. <br/> <br/> In order to even apply for SSDI benefits an applicant must have worked enough to have paid into the system and to be considered \"insured\" under the SSDI definition. If you have no work history then you will not qualify for any benefits. <br/> <br/> In addition, social security has some of the strictest requirements in the world in order to qualify for benefits. These requirements are typically much more demanding as compared to commercial disability insurance programs. In general, to qualify for SSDI you must have an impairment that will last one year or more, or result in death, and you must also be unable to perform any substantial work. <br/> <br/> As a result, approved recipients of SSDI are among the most severely impaired individuals in the country and greatly depend on their benefits. In many cases, their SSDI checks are a lifeline preventing them from slipping into poverty. <br/> <br/> However, not all disabled recipients will remain on SSDI nor do they wish to do so. They would often prefer to recover enough to get back to work and perhaps earn more money doing meaningful and enjoyable work. As such, social security offers incentive programs to give those SSDI recipients who are able an opportunity to return to work.  Some of these incentives include continued cash benefits for a period of time while they work, continued Medicare and Medicaid coverage, and assistance with education, training and rehabilitation to start a new line of work. <br/> <br/> Through a program called \"Ticket to Work\", social security gives participants a \"ticket\" to go back to work while continuing to receive SSDI benefits. This program is both free and voluntary and gives access to an employment network, which offers assistance with job searches and placement, and vocational rehabilitation and training. <br/> <br/> \"Ticket to Work\" has been a valuable and effective program at social security.  It has provided a mechanism for recipients of SSDI to exit the SSDI program and return to meaningful work which not only provides for a higher income but also the dignity and emotional benefits derived from being employed and making a contribution to society. <br/> <br/> SSDI is not simply just another entitlement program.  It's sophisticated design and structure also provides for affordable and manageable exit strategies even after benefits commence. Although it is extremely difficult to qualify for benefits, once approved SSDI also offers mechanisms to leave the program and return to a more normal and productive life.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 18:30:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 18:30:59.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_P3aTGUM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-security-disability-ticket-to-work/\", \"post_id\": \"6062\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 18:30:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 18:30:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-security-disability-ticket-to-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6061\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2776\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Person-in-a-wheelchair-007.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1653\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442329200,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2706,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Prepare Your Business for the $15 Minimum Wage Hike","link":"how-to-prepare-your-business-for-the-15-minimum-wage-hike","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s an issue that&rsquo;s been heatedly debated among politicians, businesses, and employees, but chances are, your city is soon to be experiencing a hike to a $15 minimum wage. Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are on the front lines of the progression to lift the citywide minimum wage to $15 in the next few years. New York state has recommended a $15 minimum hourly wage for fast-food chains and their employees by the end of 2018.</p><p> <strong>  What About Employees and ROI? </strong></p><p> What does this mean for companies? Well, that&rsquo;s still up for debate.</p><p> Some politicians and economists argue that it will actually hurt employees &mdash; the higher costs of business will cause organizations to lay off more workers, and others could turn to automation to cut costs. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/minimum-wage-backfire-1413934569\" target=\"_blank\">   The Wall Street Journal  </a> </u> , fast-food chain McDonald&rsquo;s has already announced plans to reduce its cashier workforce, instead turning to automated machines for customer checkout. </p><p> Businesses &mdash; particularly small businesses &mdash; are concerned what these mandatory wage hikes will do to their ROI. Brett Bastian, CEO of Salt Lake City, Utah-based Blast Moba, told  <a href=\"http://www.business.com/entrepreneurship/the-potential-impact-of-a-15-dollar-minimum-wage/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Business.com </a>  that this impact on his company&rsquo;s ROI will eventually hurt the consumer:</p><p> &ldquo;As a business owner, my biggest expense is labor. Increasing minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 is doubling it. This is a huge burden to businesses but the cost will get passed on to consumers. I have a business partner who said he will have to increase his prices by 40% if it happens.&rdquo;</p><p> However, some economists disagree with this negative assessment. According to Business.com, the former chief economic adviser to Joe Biden, Jared Bernstein, said that the downsides would be outweighed by the economic impact of pay gains for low-income employees. He also noted that businesses have several years to prepare.</p><p> If businesses do have this time to prep for the $15 minimum wage, there are three major things they should do to plan.</p><h3> #1. Dig Into Your Finances</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s time to get real. No company can effectively understand the impact of a mandatory $15 minimum wage if they don&rsquo;t have utter transparency into their finances. Understand your cash flow &mdash; your revenue, your expenses, and your profit. Look at what your exact figures are in labor costs now and how you anticipate them to change. This will give you the accurate figures to understand how the wage hike will affect you specifically as a company, outside of the talking heads in the media.</p><p> From here, and only afterward, can you move forward building a strategy for hiring and managing the changes in wage policy.</p><h3> #2. Streamline Hiring</h3><p> <br/> After you have evaluated your finances, you may see things right off the bat you can change to help your changing ROI when it comes to hiring. And it doesn&rsquo;t always mean laying people off. The better word would be &ldquo;streamlining.&rdquo; In this area, efficiency is key, but not to the extent of overworked employees.</p><p> Patrice Rice, founder and CEO of hospitality recruiting company Patrice &amp; Associates, told  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-30/how-small-employers-can-prepare-for-minimum-wage-hikes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bloomberg  </a> </u>  her advice she doles out to restaurants and other companies when it comes to cutting labor costs:</p><p> &ldquo;You can manage a larger payroll by analyzing peak days and times and not scheduling people on slower shifts. You don&rsquo;t need three cooks, a sous chef, and an executive chef standing by if you don&rsquo;t have the volume to support that staffing level.&rdquo;</p><p> Trimming the hours may seem like bad news to employees, but by building in this efficiency of employees not standing around during off hours, it increases their opportunity for tips at the peak times they are scheduled &mdash; which often can more than offset the hourly wage difference.</p><p> On the opposite end, when you are hiring, only hire the best, most essential workers. </p><p> If you treat your employees as an investment, you are less likely to make a quick hire to fill a need and cost yourself money when they exit the door in six months. Turn your attention toward recruiting and hiring candidates that fit your culture, your brand, and your values &mdash; not to mention have the skills for the job. It will save you money in the long run.</p><h3> #3. Boost Your Prices Knowledgably and Creatively</h3><p> <br/> If your business must ultimately boost prices to save your ROI, make sure they are educated &mdash; and innovative &mdash; adjustments. Bob Puccini told Business.com that he supports the minimum wage changes, and he has already made simple changes that he sees affecting his bottom line. Puccini is the chief executive of Puccini Group, based in San Francisco, a company that creates and runs restaurants inside hotel, hospitals, and cruise ships. As he told Business.com:</p><p> &ldquo;In San Francisco, the cost of living is too high for anyone to live on minimum wage. And in my experience, the majority of people making minimum wage are not teenagers. They&rsquo;re women trying to support a family. If we didn&rsquo;t pay them more, they would have to deal with food stamps and other government assistance that costs all taxpayers more in the long run.&rdquo;</p><p> To support his company with San Francisco&rsquo;s proposed increases, Puccini did a major evaluation of his company&rsquo;s clients&rsquo; financials &mdash; in particular their menu item costs and popularity. He singled out the most popular dishes, he said, the ones bringing in the most money, from each of his clients&rsquo; restaurants, and then he boosted the prices by as little as a few cents each. While the customers barely noticed any changes, the restaurants and the Puccini Group certainly noticed that the changes made a big impact.</p><p> Likewise, dishes that were costing the most money to produce and not seeing the same popularity were eliminated from the menu.</p><p> Following Puccini&rsquo;s plan, companies can adjust their prices smartly. Major changes could upset their customers or clients, but smaller, targeted changes could be a win-win.</p><p> The $15 minimum wage mandate is all but certain. Businesses should be using the time before its implementation to ready their organization for the changes.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 18:37:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 18:37:19.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_YqkD15Z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-prepare-your-business-for-the-15-minimum-wage-hike/\", \"post_id\": \"6064\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 18:37:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 18:37:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-prepare-your-business-for-the-15-minimum-wage-hike\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6063\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2777\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AP464726239137.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"488\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442343600,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2707,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The BEST Methods for Making Time for Social Media","link":"the-best-methods-for-making-time-for-social-media","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Many people ask me, &ldquo;How can you build a Personal Brand and do a full time job?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s difficult, which is why I&rsquo;m sitting here at 07:00 AM writing this.</p><p> Guess I&rsquo;m lucky that one of my work objective is to support the organisation in terms of Social Selling as well as be a though leader to the external world. Often my Social activity is misunderstood as &ldquo;not working&rdquo;.</p><h3> Are Tweeting or Working?</h3><p> <br/> When I&rsquo;m working on Social Media, I make no secret of the fact I work at Oracle, I decided early on to split my Twitter accounts and use  <u>  @OracleTim </u>  for work activity. But really what happens is that @OracleTim tends to be used for more Technical interest, like Cloud, Big Data and Oracle events that I think people would be interested in. So while  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Timothy_Hughes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @Timothy_Hughes  </a> </u>  is an &ldquo;Oracle free zone&rdquo; the subjects it promotes, such as Marketing, Cloud, Customer Experience, Social Selling etc all have market creation potential for Oracle.</p><p> Good friend of mine  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackKosakowski\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @JackKosakowski  </a> </u>  works for a Marketing Automation company but he doesn&rsquo;t tweet all day about Marketing Automation. Jack is a Social Selling Evangelist and he blogs about Social Selling. He and I agree that to implement Social Selling as a strategy, Sales people should look at automation to undertake some of the &ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo; allowing you to get out the office and be in front of customers.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s the trick!</p><p> We may not explicitly talk about our employers, their products and services, but if you implement Social Selling, our respective companies do sell tools as tactics in the strategy.</p><h3> All you do is Tweet and Blog all Day!</h3><p> <br/> Place this in the context of my Blog. I have to admit I&rsquo;m a Buffer user. In my Blog, while I don&rsquo;t recommend mass automation, some automation does free you up to do other things. A day&rsquo;s work for example.</p><h3> Typical Day</h3><p> <br/> My day begins at 05:00, after feeding Tiger the cat (he won&rsquo;t let me start anything until he&rsquo;s fed). I&rsquo;ll have breakfast and fill my &ldquo;Buffer&rdquo; up, this allows me to Tweet all day and do a day&rsquo;s work. When I get in the evening, I also fill Buffer up to allow me to reach followers in the US and Far East.</p><p> Also allow myself two posts on LinkedIn a day, one that I will post during this session eating my breakfast and the second post, again to reach the US and Far East Followers.</p><p> If I&rsquo;m travelling into London to meet with customers, will also use Flipboard or other content curation tools to keep up-to-date with the latest articles and will share anything I feel is interesting.</p><p> Typically, during lunchtime I check the news and my inbox to see if there any interesting articles and Tweet or post on LinkedIn or Facebook.</p><h3> But I Thought you said Social Media is About Engagement</h3><p> <br/> It is! I ALWAYS find time to &ldquo;do my Twitter&rdquo; as I call it. This is where I go through all of the daily comments, DMs, retweets, conversations and answer them personally. If you are a brand, my view is you need to respond within the hour. The fact I&rsquo;m not responding for sometimes eight hours seems to work for me and my community.</p><p> As a rule of thumb, using automation to deliver content that you&rsquo;ve hand picked has value. All you&rsquo;re doing is using automation to spread it out over the day. Using automation to deliver messages that haven&rsquo;t had some of that &ldquo;hand picked love&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have value.</p><p> My friend, Ted Rubin was over in London this week, when I met up with him, I checked this out and he did something similar. He refuses to use any automation, but like me, he can sit there for an hour (some days) in the morning and evening, answering comments.</p><h3> Social &ndash; Back to Basics</h3><p> <br/> If you think Social is about banging out corporate content then I&rsquo;m sorry you are just as much as a dinosaur that people who don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get it&rdquo;.</p><p> Social IS about engagement, everybody knows I work at Oracle, but I don&rsquo;t have to stand there with a sign saying &ldquo;Buy Oracle&rdquo;. In fact, you will find that buyers will actually avoid you. Think of it as &ldquo;Sellers Karma&rdquo;, every day I post, every day I engage and interact. Somebody will get a good feeling about those &ldquo;guys at Oracle&rdquo;. It might not get us on every short list, but, maybe, just maybe, it gets us on one more than we had last week. Now that would be a great place to be! <br/> The same for the company you represent. While I may not have heard about your company, follow me, engage and interact, and like a long list of my friends, I will then soon have.</p><h3> Final Words from Ted Rubin</h3><p> <br/> When we were out, Ted told me the story about Gary Vaynerchuk ( <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Garyvee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @Garyvee  </a> </u> ) when asked,; &ldquo;How do you find time for Social&rdquo;. Gary answered, &ldquo;Sleep Less&rdquo;. Ted went on to say &ldquo;I like to say it&rsquo;s about choices &hellip;.

{"original_id":2708,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Where Does Your Power Come From?","link":"where-does-your-power-come-from","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;Power is like being a lady&hellip; if you have to tell people you are, you aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &mdash;Margaret Thatcher</p><h3> Sources of Power</h3><p> <br/> Power is the ability to influence the behavior of others, to overcome resistance, and to get people to do things they may not otherwise do. There are two main bases of power: positional power and personal power. You can access these bases through several sources. You can possess positional power as either legitimate, reward, or coercive. Your personal power can be either expert or referent. Each of these forms of power can achieve differing degrees of effectiveness based on the specific situation you are facing.</p><p> Just as you use various leadership styles to motivate others and get things done, you are in a better position to influence others if you have access to different sources of power. So, where does your power come from?</p><h3> Positional power</h3><p> <br/> Positional power is based on your rank within the structure of your organization and is granted to you by someone who is your superior. This form of power is task oriented and focused on giving orders without asking subordinates for their input or ideas. Much of its effectiveness is dependent on your ability to either reward or punish those who work under you. Use of positional power often results in low work satisfaction, lack of commitment, high job stress, high turnover, and even sabotage.</p><p> <strong>  Legitimate power </strong></p><p> Legitimate power is a form of positional power that can also be referred to as formal authority. This source of power relies solely on holding a position of responsibility. With legitimate power, you have the right to command others based on your position within the structural hierarchy of the organization.</p><p> <strong>  Reward power </strong></p><p> Reward power is a form of positional power that is based on your ability to control tangible benefits such as parking spaces, flexible work schedules, promotions, or bonuses. Reward power operates on the desires of others. When you have the authority to determine who will receive rewards or eliminate unpleasant penalties, you have reward power.</p><p> <strong>  Coercive power </strong></p><p> Coercive power is a form of positional power that is based on your ability to punish, discipline, or withhold rewards when subordinates do not act in accordance with commands or requirements. Coercive power operates on other&rsquo;s fears. When you have the authority to determine and deliver punishment or withhold desired rewards, you have coercive power.</p><h3> Personal power</h3><p> <br/> Personal power is based on individual qualities. It is not necessarily given by superiors, but instead, by subordinates themselves. This form of power is relationship oriented. Personal power is held by individuals who behave in ways that motivate and inspire others. They create a supportive organizational environment where they recognize and acknowledge the individual needs of others. They are active listeners who encourage two-way communication and focus their energy on helping others grow. Use of personal power usually results in higher motivation and productivity, lower stress levels, and stronger commitment.</p><p> <strong>  Expert power </strong></p><p> Expert power is a form of personal power that stems from the unique expertise, specific knowledge, or skill set of an individual. If you possess expert power, you influence others because you have specific qualities and proficiencies that they value. You are the go-to person for advice. You are an expert as solving problems or performing tasks.</p><p> <strong>  Referent power </strong></p><p> Referent power is a form of personal power that stems from an individual&rsquo;s charisma and reputation. It is derived from personal characteristics that result in admiration from others. If you possess referent power, you have the ability to influence others based on your charisma and reputation. People like you and admire your accomplishments. They believe in your causes and see you as a role-model. People trust you and follow you willingly.</p><h3> Where Does Your Power Come From?</h3><p> <br/> Leadership is influence and power is the tool that gives you the ability to influence the behavior of others. Both positional and personal power can be effective in specific situations. The task oriented nature of positional power is effective at accomplishing short-term, production oriented goals but can have a negative effect on job satisfaction and motivation in the long run. Being relationship oriented, personal power builds a strong culture and increases productivity.</p><p> It is important to evaluate and understand your sources of power. Which one will work best based on your current situation and goals? Which one will serve you best in the long-run? By answering these questions, you will become more effective at influencing others.</p><p> So, where does  <strong>  YOUR </strong>  power come from?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 18:48:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 18:48:52.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_qHugvXI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/where-does-your-power-come-from/\", \"post_id\": \"6068\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 18:48:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 18:48:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"where-does-your-power-come-from\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6067\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2779\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AFP_Getty-3228592.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"865\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442336400,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2709,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Voting Client Proxies","link":"voting-client-proxies","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The right to cast votes on certain corporate matters is an important power given to shareholders of publicly traded companies and mutual funds. Your RIA firm is expected to address its role with respect to voting proxies on behalf of clients. You may agree to take on the responsibility to vote proxies on securities they own, or you may elect to not vote their proxies. In each instance, regulators expect you to have clearly defined and communicated policies and procedures related to this vital aspect of corporate governance so clients understand if and how their votes are cast.</p><h3> Advisor Proxy Voting In a Nutshell</h3><p> <br/> Shareholders of publicly traded companies and mutual funds have the right to express their opinion on certain business matters that impact the value of the securities they own. Board of director elections, mergers and acquisitions and changes in fee schedules (in the case of mutual funds) are examples of decisions that are delegated to shareholders.</p><p> Since most shareholders do not attend annual meetings in person, their opinions on these matters are communicated by casting a ballot either electronically or via mail.</p><p> Custodians and broker-dealers normally receive and transmit notices of upcoming proxy votes, meeting and record dates and other information on upcoming corporate actions by companies in which their client&rsquo;s are shareholders.</p><p> Accepting this responsibility for your clients is a significant undertaking, so it is important to consider the pros/cons of doing so. On one hand, clients may appreciate that you serve as their voice in significant matters that affect the value of their investments. But agreeing to vote client proxies requires a significant amount of process monitoring and record keeping. </p><p> For this reason, most RIA firms elect to not vote proxies.</p><p> Your firm&rsquo;s policies on voting proxies should be disclosed and clearly described in:</p><li> Form ADV Part 2A, Item 17 - Voting Client Securities</li><li> Advisory Agreements, either in the section that describes your investment discretion authority or in a standalone section <br/>  </li><p> Note: If you have discretionary investment authority over client accounts and your ADV and agreements remain silent on this topic, it is assumed that you do vote proxies.</p><h3> If your firm does not vote proxies</h3><p> <br/> If your firm does not intend to vote proxies, and you do not intend to advise clients on how to vote proxies, you must disclose this in Form ADV and communicate to clients that they retain the authority and responsibility for voting their own proxies. </p><p> If a client reaches out with questions regarding a particular proxy vote, you may assist them in understanding the background and intent of the proxy, but your guidance must not influence their voting decision. In doing so, your firm should remind them that they assume the responsibility for ultimately making the voting decision of making the contractual decision of their voting shares, and that you are prohibited from providing the service of that advice.</p><p> In this instance, your clients will receive proxy statements directly from the Custodian. They should not be sent to you.</p><h3> If your firm does vote proxies</h3><p> <br/> If you do intend to vote proxies, you are required to do so in the best interest of your clients. When setting up new client accounts at your custodian, you should request that they forward proxy statements to you directly instead of your client.</p><p> In addition, you must:</p><li> Develop and implement policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that your firm votes proxies in the best interest of its clients,</li><li> Describe your firm&rsquo;s proxy voting policy to clients (via Form ADV 2A and advisory agreements) and provide copies to clients upon request, and</li><li> Disclose how clients can obtain information on how your firm voted their proxies.</li><p> <br/> In fact, regulators consider it fraudulent for advisors to exercise proxy voting authority without fulfilling these three requirements.</p><h3> Through the Regulator's Eyes</h3><p>  </p><p> When it comes to proxy voting, regulators simply expect that you clearly communicate your policy on voting proxies for your clients. When you do accept this responsibility, you are expected to exercise this duty in the client's best interest, avoid and disclose any conflicts of interest that may come up in these corporate matters and  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.advisorassist.com/2013/02/the-advisorassist-cco-series-books.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   maintain proper books and records  </a> </u>  that demonstrate that you are fulfilling this duty in accordance with the Advisers Act.</p><p> A copy of the SEC&rsquo;s final rule on advisors voting proxies can be found here.</p><h3> CCO Best Practices <br/>  </h3><li> Consider whether or not your clients would gain a material benefit by your advising their proxy voting responsibilities, and if that benefit would be worth the related compliance burden.</li><li> If your firm does not vote client proxies: <li>  Review client activities to ensure that your firm has not voted proxies for any clients. </li> <li>  Review any exceptions made to the proxy voting policy and all supporting documentation and ensure that all were properly documented and approved by the CCO. </li> <li>  If you ever choose to begin voting proxies, revise your proxy voting policy to comply with the Adviser's Act. </li></li><li> If your firm does vote client proxies: <li>  Confirm that existing proxy voting policies and procedures are adequately designed to ensure that votes are consistent with client interests. </li> <li>  Conduct a forensic test by reviewing a sample of proxies voted during a particular period and confirm that each proxy was voted in accordance with your policy and that each were voted in the best interest of the client. </li> <li>  Review any exceptions made to the proxy voting policy and all supporting documentation. </li> <li>  Ensure that all exceptions were properly documented and approved by your firm&rsquo;s CCO. </li> <li>  Review your firm&rsquo;s books and records to confirm that for the previous five years you can produce a copy of each proxy you received, records for all proxies voted (with any related back up), a log of any proxy voting information requests by clients and your firm&rsquo;s responses to those requests. </li></li>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 18:51:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 18:51:23.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_y0zXNKY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/voting-client-proxies/\", \"post_id\": \"6070\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 18:51:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 18:51:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"voting-client-proxies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6069\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2780\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442156541780-c19f7f2a7fa2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2457\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442337300,"author_id":80,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;d been consulting for years, but had built all my businesses on referrals and prior relationships. 2009 you may remember, was in the depths of the recession and business was s-l-o-w.</p><p> So imagine my surprise when my initial digital mailing list (about 600 of my flesh-and-blood peeps) suddenly started populating with Twitter followers I&rsquo;d never met. And they started writing to me. Publicly and privately.</p><p> My first client came two months in&mdash;he&rsquo;d read one of my articles and seemed almost dazzled that there was someone who could do exactly what he needed done. But he wasn&rsquo;t nearly as dazzled as I was&mdash;a client just coming in over the transom? No advertising, no traveling to coffees and lunches, no business development.

HBR projects that the aging population will contribute to a growth of roughly 22 percent for health care practitioner and technical jobs and about 28 percent for health care support jobs.</p><p> Clearly, the aging population is something businesses will have to take into consideration in both their marketing and hiring decisions. But what about the other demographic changes our nation is likely to see in the next decade? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics &ndash; also used as a source for the HBR interactive &ndash; predicts that the proportion of Asians in the U.S. workforce will increase by roughly 30 percent from 2010 to 2020, and the percentage of American workers of Hispanic origin will increase by around 34 percent during that same period, representing an overall trend in the diversification of the American population.</p><p> Companies hoping to stay competitive in this changing demographic landscape cannot overlook these changes. What is your business&rsquo;s strategy to attract and keep a diverse workforce that represents the makeup of the American population? Do you have one? What does your company have in mind to cater to the increasing numbers of Hispanic-Americans when marketing your products and services?

{"original_id":2712,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Women in Sales – Are We Equals?","link":"women-in-sales-are-we-equals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> On a train back from a business meeting in New York City, I started reading Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Lean In&rdquo;.  I honestly didn&rsquo;t expect it to be a page turner but it turned out to be just that.  Sheryl has a writing style that I as a professional woman can easily relate to. Her stories are insightful and I was stunned how many light bulbs went off in my head when she was pointing out over and over that we &ldquo;women in business&rdquo; haven&rsquo;t quite arrived.</p><p> Some examples that she featured were just simply eye opening and at some point I put the book down to reflect on my personal experience as a woman with many years in the business world.  While I could relate to most of the examples that she was pinpointing, I also felt that my personal journey, while tough at times, never left me feeling that I was inferior to my male colleagues or that I was treated differently.</p><p> After some soul searching I asked myself the question whether it had something to do with the fact that I was in sales.  Maybe, Sales is an equalizer, I thought.</p><h3> Is the Business of Sales an Equalizer?</h3><p> <br/> Most business practices cannot be measured in numbers only. In sales, that&rsquo;s all that matters. If you put numbers on the book and you sell, nobody (sadly) cares how you do it and you are simply measured by your accomplishments.  It&rsquo;s your performance that counts.</p><p> When I was employed as a sales professional, I was usually the only girl on the team. While my male colleagues were a bit suspicious and cautious at first, they had no choice than to accept me once I started producing.  They had to treat me with respect, because my managers were pleased with the results that I brought to the table and the ultimate judge is not your sales manager, but your prospects turned to clients.  If you cannot convert sales it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you sales manager likes you are not.  As a matter of fact, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if anybody internally takes a liking to you personally or not as long as you keep closing business. It&rsquo;s really all about performance!</p><p> It was at that point where my light bulb went off.  Sales is one of the few disciplines were women (when successful) are equal to their male counterparts.  In sales we are part of the group, we have a seat at the table, we don&rsquo;t choose a chair in the back (just like Sheryl notes in her book).  Our voices are heard when we bring results.</p><h3> Removed from the Politics?</h3><p> <br/> I also remembered that it relieved me from having to play the political game.  Many years ago I was traveling to San Francisco to attend a sales meeting and the first night after dinner the team ended up at the hotel bar for a nightcap.  At first we were drinking wine and beer but then one of the junior sales people who wanted to impress our sales manager suggested to do shots.  One of my fellow team members, who happened to be a guy and I just looked at each other and we had a common understanding of what we will do next. Tim, a manly looking guy (Dwayne Johnson alias The Rock lookalike, anybody?) who is sensible, sensitive and also a good listener (which of course made him an excellent sales person) and I excused ourselves and went upstairs to our respective rooms. I myself decided to watch some mindless television show and Tim probably checked in with his wife who was at home with their small children. The looks we got indicated that people thought we might have had something going on because we left at the same time. But Tim and I didn&rsquo;t care. We didn&rsquo;t have to play the socializing corporate game. We didn&rsquo;t need to impress our sales manager because we were both top performers.</p><h3> The Equality Gap</h3><p> <br/> Needless to say that women show results in every industry and every profession, albeit though, there are ways to put us down by questioning our style (women who are driven are often viewed as aggressive, but men aren&rsquo;t?), or our approach (women who are competitive are often viewed as you know what, but for guys that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s expected?).  Are our results measured with the same parameters as men&rsquo;s results? In sales, my experience has been that none of that seems to matter as much as in other professions.</p><p> So, in closing, I am asking all my fellow sales women out there.  Do you also feel Sales is equalizer or has been an equalizer for you?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 19:10:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 19:10:15.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_xldI10g.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-in-sales-are-we-equals/\", \"post_id\": \"6076\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 19:10:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 19:10:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-in-sales-are-we-equals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6075\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2783\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441960114565-066d7a7b544b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"481\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442347200,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2713,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Set Money Goals You Can Reach","link":"how-to-set-money-goals-you-can-reach","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Setting and achieving goals is an important part of life. Without goals, it&rsquo;s impossible to assess where you are and where you want to be. Whether you&rsquo;re planning for the long- or short-term, goals require tenacity and perseverance.</p><p> Financial goals often require a longer timeframe than other goals, but even big goals are within your reach. Like any accomplishment you want to attain they require dedication and patience, but the payoff is substantial.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how you can create money goals that you can actually reach.</p><h3> Creating SMART Goals</h3><p> <br/> Setting attainable goals starts with getting SMART. This is a useful acronym to keep in mind when  <u>  dealing with money goals </u> . It gives you an easy-to-remember formula for choosing achievements you can reach.</p><p> Breaking down the SMART formula, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll want to consider when setting goals:</p><li> <strong>  Specific </strong>  &ndash; What is your goal? State and write down what your goal is. Don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;to save.&rdquo; Instead, say, &ldquo;to save $3,000 in  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/stop-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my emergency fund  </a> </u>  and to save enough money to max out my IRA this year.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Measurable </strong>  &ndash; How will you evaluate your progress? If you can&rsquo;t measure what you&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s hard to know when you&rsquo;ve actually achieved your money goals.</li><li> <strong>  Attainable </strong>  &ndash; What are you going to do to successfully achieve your goal? Will you need to pick up a second job or  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-keep-your-kids-extracurricular-activities-from-breaking-the-bank/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reduce your expenses  </a> </u> ? Consider what you will need to do right now to achieve your goal.</li><li> <strong>  Realistic </strong>  &ndash; Can you reasonably expect to meet your money goals? It&rsquo;s not logical to set a goal of making $500,000 next year if you&rsquo;re currently earning $50,000 with no plan for increasing your income. It&rsquo;s more reasonable to say, &ldquo;I have an action plan for increasing my income and I want to break six figures in the next 18 months.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Time-related </strong>  &ndash; Specify when you want to accomplish your goal, whether it&rsquo;s 6 months from now or ten. Without a deadline, a goal is just a dream! <br/>  </li><p> By defining your goal with the SMART formula, you&rsquo;ll have a clearly defined action plan that gets you closer to achieving your goal. And you can apply SMART to any goals you have, not just financial ones!</p><h3> Short- Versus Long-Term Goals</h3><p> <br/> Consider your future plans when making goals according to the SMART formula. Almost every goal you have requires financial resources, even if your goal is to eventually live off-the-grid in a tiny house. This is when it&rsquo;s important to set both short- and long-term goals.</p><p> Short-term goals include any goals you want to accomplish within the next 5 to 10 years. These goals could include saving up to go back to school, buying a new home, or  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/13-money-tips-for-parents-to-be/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   starting a family  </a> </u> .</p><p> Setting short-term financial goals is important because it keeps you focused on the near-term future. If your goal is to get your law degree in the next 4 years, you&rsquo;ll need to focus intently on  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/back-to-basics-with-the-b-word/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   budgeting for your tuition  </a> </u>  as well as saving for living expenses if you need to quit your current job.</p><p> Long-term goals include anything you want to accomplish 10 years and beyond. This includes retirement, but also saving for your children&rsquo;s schooling, or owning your own business. Planning for long-term goals can be easier, as you have a longer timeframe to save and make adjustments as you need to. However, it&rsquo;s also easier to get distracted along the way.</p><p> While staying motivated over the years to achieve your financial goals can be tough, it&rsquo;s not insurmountable. By breaking down your goals into bite-sized pieces and setting regular check-ins on your progress, you&rsquo;re more likely to see consistent rewards. Setting small, measurable goals is key to keeping yourself motivated. Your consistent progress will prove your hard work is paying off!</p><h3> Accomplishing Your Goals</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re following the SMART formula, you already know how important it is to analyze your progress toward your goals. However, life has a funny way of throwing curve balls at us that sometimes cause us to get off track. It happens, but there are definitely ways to handle these deviations.</p><p> Take a  <u>  look at the bigger picture </u>  when you&rsquo;re evaluating your goals, particularly if you&rsquo;ve been thrown off track:</p><p> <strong>  Prioritize </strong>  &ndash; Make sure to prioritize your goals over any other distractions. Ask yourself what is more important: your short-term goals of  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/5-rent-vs-own-considerations-for-gen-y/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   owning a house  </a> </u> , or spending money on X?</p><p> <strong>  Automate </strong>  &ndash; One of the secrets to staying on track for your goals, particularly for long-term goals, is automation. By setting up an automatic direct deposit from your checking account into a savings account, your savings is taken care of for you! This saves you the extra step of having to manually take out your savings and reduces the risk of you spending your money ahead of time.</p><p> <strong>  Track </strong>  &ndash; Consider creating a regular tracking system for your financial goals. This includes using Personal Capital, Mint, an Excel spreadsheet, or even a low-tech pencil and paper spreadsheet to monitor your progress. By tracking your goals, you&rsquo;ll be able to quickly see your progress and whether or not you&rsquo;re achieving those bite-sized goals you set for yourself.</p><p> It almost goes without saying that one of the most important qualities to have when setting goals is patience. Working toward any goal that takes a while to complete requires a dogged determination, but that&rsquo;s not to say you shouldn&rsquo;t celebrate small victories.</p><p> Every once in a while, lean back from the day-to-day and take a look at your big picture. If something isn&rsquo;t working for you, now is the time to re-evaluate your SMART goals. Is there another way to tackle this goal, or can you adjust the timeframe? Giving yourself the ability to lean back and take a fresh look at goals will also help keep you on track.</p><p> As you accomplish your short-term goals, congratulate yourself and celebrate a little! Achieving goals isn&rsquo;t something that happens every day, and you deserve a pat on the back for following through. Then propel yourself into setting and seeing through another round of successful financial goals.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 19:19:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 19:19:18.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_lk2a1j4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-set-money-goals-you-can-reach/\", \"post_id\": \"6078\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 19:19:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 19:19:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-set-money-goals-you-can-reach\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6077\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2784\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/How-To-Set-Goals-In-Life-And-Achieve-Them-Become-The-Best-You-Can-Be.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1573\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442322000,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2714,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Secret to Holding A Meeting That Gets Results","link":"the-secret-to-holding-a-meeting-that-gets-results","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Does this sound familiar? You went to a meeting where you had invigorating discussions, examined alternatives, came up with a cool plan of action, everyone left the meeting feeling motivated, and then six weeks later you get back together. As everyone enters the room and takes their seat, there are sideways glances, &ldquo;Did you do that thing we talked about?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;No&hellip;how about you?&rdquo;</p><p> A quick shake of the head and you realize that the great idea everyone talked about has languished.</p><p> The prior meeting, the discussions, the new meeting &ndash; all of it &ndash; are a waste because nothing happened. In fact, it&rsquo;s worse than doing nothing because now you&rsquo;ve created negative energy&hellip;that feeling that &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter what we talk about because nothing really changes around here.&rdquo; That corrosive malaise will eat away at your people and leave them looking for excuses to take your next meeting via conference call so they can multi-task and &ldquo;get real work done.&rdquo;</p><p> Every meeting you hold should produce activities that move results forward, build momentum, and build morale with healthy relationships. You can achieve all this in just ten minutes at the end of every meeting.</p><h3> The Best 10 Minutes of Every Meeting</h3><p> <br/> At the end of every meeting ask these three commitment questions:</p><h3> Commitment #1:  Who will do what?</h3><p> <br/> There are actually two questions here:</p><li> What is to be done?</li><li> Who will do it? <br/>  </li><p> Every task must have a specific person who is responsible to complete it. For smaller decisions there might be only one or two answers to this question. For larger strategic initiatives you might have an entire work plan that outlines dozens of tasks and people responsible.</p><h3> Commitment # 2 By When?</h3><p> <br/> This one is straightforward. What is the finish line for the tasks people have agreed to complete? When these deadlines are shared and publicly available, everyone is more likely to meet them.</p><h3> Commitment #3 How Will We Know?</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;How will we know?&rdquo; is the magic question that moves your meeting from good intentions to real-world impact. It&rsquo;s also the one managers most frequently ignore. &ldquo;How will we know?&rdquo; closes the loop from intention to action and creates momentum without you having to spend hours every day tracking down action steps. Here&rsquo;s how it works: When someone completes a task, what do they do next?</p><li> Do they need to pass the results to another person or group?</li><li> Should they update the team and let them know?</li><li> Will they make a presentation of their findings?</li><li> Do they report completion in a common area or software? <br/>  </li><p> The specific answers depend on the task and project. What matters is that the accountability and next step are &ldquo;baked into&rdquo; the decision. Everyone knows what he or she is accountable to do, the team knows if it&rsquo;s been completed, and no one is left waiting around for information they need.</p><p> Combine these commitments into one sentence: Who does what, by when, and how will we know? and you have the Winning Well Meeting Formula to get clarity, accountability, and results in just ten minutes at the end of every meeting: In fact, you can ask these questions whether you are the positional leader of a group or not. That&rsquo;s a great way to establish yourself as a leader who gets things done &ndash; people notice when you produce clarity, accountability, and results. Don&rsquo;t let the simplicity of these questions fool you into not using them.  These are the most important ten minutes you&rsquo;ll spend to make your meetings achieve results.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 19:29:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 19:29:04.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_rTJ7tg1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-to-holding-a-meeting-that-gets-results/\", \"post_id\": \"6080\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 19:29:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 19:29:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-to-holding-a-meeting-that-gets-results\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6079\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2785\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/people-coffee-notes-tea-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"593\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442313900,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

Never hurry the growth process and do be 100% sure that you are going to have the following systems in your business. They are going to help you to drastically increase the possibility of future success.  The same is true for career growth.</p><h3> Cash Management</h3><p> <br/> You need to use a system that focuses on projecting the accounts receivable and then add the inflows against the accounts payable, together with all other outflows. Management of your cash will help you to anticipate any shortage that would appear. It is important as it keeps you protected at all times from one of the most common  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.monetarylibrary.com/why-do-startups-fail-avoid-errors-for-long-term-success\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reasons why start-ups fail  </a> </u> : lack of funds when payments are necessary. The great thing about cash management is that this is a process that can be automated. Just half an hour per week can help you to prepare for any problem that would appear.</p><h3> Budget Management</h3><p> <br/> You need a one year profit plan that would be a huge part of your management control. The system that you are about to use has to take into account the historical cost structure of the form and include zero based budgeting. Automating the process will help you to produce great monthly budgets.</p><h3> Variance Reporting</h3><p> <br/> This is a system that is completely complementary to your budget system. It has to automate comparison production of the results against the budget in order to bring in a proper image of the current situation of the company. Any report has to include the trouble areas so that the management team can take proper action.</p><h3> Labour Burden Worksheet</h3><p> <br/> It is important to know the burdens that the staff is faced with. Implementing a  <u>  labour burden worksheet </u>  is going to help you deal with this problem. You get to see exactly how much the employees work and can see when they are close to getting to saturation. It is not at all difficult to predict problems and deal with them before they negatively affect your company.</p><h3> A Pricing System</h3><p> <br/> Such a system is going to automate pricing calculation, what is needed in order to meet the overhead absorption requirements, together with the budgeted profit goals. Alternatively, net profit margin can be seen before the application of taxing on a proposed pricing scheme. Use such a system whenever it is needed.</p><h3> An Incentive Plan Worksheet</h3><p> <br/> This worksheet is an equitably distributing profit sharing system that would give incentives to the employees based on performance, responsibilities and loyalty. When properly constructed, this is a system that just needs to be used 15 minutes once per quarter in order to be successful.</p><h3> Sales Reporter</h3><p> <br/> Such a system should work on a weekly basis. It will keep track of the product sales and even the salesman on a time frame that you decide. Half an hour per week can help you to easily deal with success and you will know what will happen in the future.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-14 19:37:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-14 19:37:56.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ulKBM5M.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/systems-that-a-small-business-needs-to-have-in-place-for-future-success/\", \"post_id\": \"6082\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-14 19:37:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-14 19:37:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"systems-that-a-small-business-needs-to-have-in-place-for-future-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6081\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2786\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/space-desk-workspace-coworking-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"555\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442317500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2716,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Best Metrics for Getting Started with Employee Engagement","link":"the-best-metrics-for-getting-started-with-employee-engagement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> During the last decade or so, human resource management has been essentially flipped on its head. What was once a decidedly employer-centered market has become one driven by the needs and concerns of the employee. Despite still relatively high competition for jobs in a recovering global economy, more and more companies that require a skilled workforce find themselves competing for the people they need to get the job done. As the human capital gurus over at Deloitte so succinctly put it in the company&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://dupress.com/periodical/trends/human-capital-trends-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Global Human Capital Trends 2015 report  </a> </u> , <strong>  &ldquo;Employees are now like customers; companies have to consider them volunteers, not just workers.&rdquo; </strong> There are a number of factors that have led to this turn of the tides. The sense is that things really began to shift when certain companies (ahem, Google) started turning their unprecedented data collection and analysis capacities inward to gather real, verifiable information on how certain quality of living benefits affected employee productivity and retention. The results told them that happy (even pampered) employees, far from getting spoiled by the good life, worked harder and stuck around longer. Recruiting and training costs went down significantly and productivity went up (and up and up) as their HR departments shifted their focus away from enforcing company policy and toward fostering employee engagement and job satisfaction. The bottom line? They end up spending far less on all those perks than they had been on turnover, plus they&rsquo;re getting higher quality talent.Now, of course, everyone knows the score, and more and more companies are looking to get on board. They really have no choice. An increasingly diverse job market means that talented and skilled workers have more options, and sites like Glassdoor.com, LinkedIn, and even Facebook give them easy access to a whole bank of available positions right along with information from current and former employees on everything from how difficult the interview process is to how well they&rsquo;ll be taken care of when they retire. Everything is on display for companies these days, and they can choose to either try to put lipstick on a pig (it would be negligent to ignore the oft-quoted statistics released earlier this year in the  <u>  Gallup&rsquo;s State of the Global Workplace Report </u>  indicating that less than a third of workers in the United States and only 13% worldwide consider themselves to be engaged in their work, with almost 18% finding themselves &ldquo;actively disengaged&rdquo;) or to turn that pig into something else. Something like delicious, enticing bacon. Fortunately, though, this bacon doesn&rsquo;t require a slaughter.What it does require is a way to accurately assess how your company measures up in the less tangible areas of company culture, employee happiness, and the much-sought-after employee engagement. <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/0940J2H0f0FEs07068D4GKz2IDK6K770o094JC2A90DCcOi980000PP3K908kF096C0.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/0940J2H0f0FEs07068D4GKz2IDK6K770o094JC2A90DCcOi980000PP3K908kF096C0.jpg \"/> </a> To meet this new challenge, the businesses world has lately been taking another look at some of the time-honored methods companies large and small have long been using to measure and assess the state of their workforce. An infographic published right here on the Findmyshift blog just a couple of months back illustrates recent findings around one of these &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.findmyshift.com/employee-performance-reviews-productive-or-destructive\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the annual review  </a> </u> . It has been found severely wanting. A distinct majority of managers and an overwhelming majority of employees find this antiquated process not only ineffective, but acutely unpleasant.</p><h3> Interestingly, many of the same qualities that make annual reviews so unpopular are shared by another long-standing HR practice, the annual survey.</h3>Like annual reviews, annual surveys are issued with the same questions across a company, blind to the vast differences between the experience &ndash; and expectations &ndash; of a sales rep at the counter and an accountant at HQ. The information is, by necessity, requested in only the vaguest of terms and the data collected is, as a result, equally vague. Consequently, an annual employee survey provides, at best, a somewhat blurry snapshot of a point in time, almost always interpreted out of context and rarely acted upon before it has become irrelevant. And this assuming that employees are providing thoughtful and truthful responses throughout and not losing interest by question 10, which anecdotal evidence suggests they do. One can turn again to the experts at <u> <a href=\"http://dupress.com/articles/employee-engagement-culture-human-capital-trends-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Deloitte </a></u> to sum up the state of affairs: &ldquo;At a time when corporate cultures are being continuously debated, shaped, and redefined on social networks, the once-a-year survey is perilously obsolete.&rdquo;<h3> If annual surveys don&rsquo;t work, how do I measure employee engagement?</h3>A good question. And who better to answer than the experts?Stephen Huerta is the Co-Founder and CEO of <u> <a href=\"http://work-ify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Workify </a></u>, a company created specifically to help organizations solve this problem. His advice? Ask the right questions and ask them more often. Then analyze the data and act on the findings.That simple, huh? Well, sort of, but not exactly. He breaks it down:<h3> Ask the right questions</h3>The traditional annual survey has something like 40-50 questions, divided into several categories pertaining to things like communication with management, transparency, general job satisfaction, etc. Interestingly, only a small subset of these questions actually elicit a thoughtful response on the part of those being surveyed. The rest tend to get an across the board equivalent of &ldquo;fine&rdquo; (7-9), yielding literally zero useful feedback. Take that survey down to only a few questions that actually feel relevant to employees, and you are much more likely to get a truthful, or at least thoughtful, response. Of course, when you only have a few questions, you really want to be sure you ask the right ones. What is becoming apparent is that today&rsquo;s employees, the ones that are taking over the job market right now (the infamous generation known as &ldquo;millennials&rdquo; will make up more than half of the nation&rsquo;s workforce in the very near future), not only expect to be happy at work, but they expect their company and their managers to create an environment conducive to professional, and in many cases personal, growth. They want to feel like they are participating in something meaningful and part of something grander than just a job.These are the factors that are going to keep them coming to work at your company and <u> <a href=\"http://learncore.com/time-management-how-to-improve-sales-productivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  keep them productive </a></u> once they&rsquo;re there. Consequently, the questions relevant to maintaining a skilled and productive workforce are the ones that gauge employee engagement, and not just the traditional &ldquo;job satisfaction&rdquo;. Engagement is about how connected an employee is to the culture, mission and values of your organization and the degree to which they are enabled and inspired to participate in furthering them. The questions you need to ask, then, will look like: &ldquo;Do you feel you have ample opportunity to further the mission of this company?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you feel your skills and capabilities are being fully utilized in your current position?&rdquo; After all, today&rsquo;s employees gauge their satisfaction on the degree to which they are moved to engage.Now, there is nothing like experience to help you determine what kinds of questions you want to ask. Consultant services like Workify and, on a gigantic (and pricey) scale, Gallup and BCG, start their work with helping companies identify, based on data like attrition rates (of both employees and customers) and on a few initial questions issued to employees, what questions are going to get you the actionable data you need. Gallup has narrowed their survey down to <u> <a href=\"http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/GMJ/9a8m0f90wearbkbzuxmw-g.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  12 standard questions </a></u>, Workify usually starts with even fewer.As you have probably surmised, there is a prerequisite to being able to ask these questions. Your company has to have a <u> <a href=\"https://cultureiq.com/blog/employee-net-promoter-score/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  culture model </a></u>. Your leadership has to know what that model is and be able to infuse it into the entirety of the workforce. Your workforce, then, has to be inspired by that culture and helped to engage in furthering it. Asking the right questions can help you identify which of these factors might be missing when it becomes clear that something is.<h3> Check in more often</h3>The approach that many companies are taking is to start with one form or another of the pulse survey. These are surveys with no more than 10 questions, but often with just 1 or 2, that every employee is asked to answer on a monthly, or sometimes biweekly, basis. They&rsquo;re quick, they&rsquo;re precise, and most importantly, they allow you to get an ongoing rather than a static picture of how your employees are feeling about their employment. That&rsquo;s right, we said &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;. BUT, Huerta points out, you can&rsquo;t just ask &ldquo;Do you feel you have ample opportunity to further the mission of this company?&rdquo; every couple of weeks and expect to glean any useful, actionable data. His company, for example, utilizes cycles to help their clients hone in on the areas that are really in need of improvement. So, the cycle might start with a general question like, &ldquo;Are you satisfied with opportunities for professional growth at this company?&rdquo; and, depending on the responses, move in the next round of surveys to &ldquo;Do you receive the support you need from your managers?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do you find channels of communication within the company to be open and functional?&rdquo; The second and third rounds of questions, then, help to identify exactly where the pain points might be.<h3> ENPS</h3>One great and increasingly popular place to start when it comes to measuring engagement is the Net Promoter Score (NPS), a score originally <u> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  devised by Harvard Business Review </a></u> in 2003 to indicate customer engagement, but easily adapted to measure that of one&rsquo;s employees. It starts by asking every employee &ldquo;How likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work?&rdquo; or some variation thereof. The possible responses, then, are place on a scale from 0-10, 0 suggesting that they would warn people away and 10 that they would tell everyone they know to apply immediately. Answers of 0-6 indicate detractors, 7 and 8 passives, and 9 and 10 promoters (though some include 8 in this last group as well). Once the responses have been gathered, you ENPS can be calculate thusly:ENPS = (# of promoters &ndash; # of detractors) / total # of respondentsThe best possible score, of course, is +100, the worst -100. A positive number means you have more promoters than detractors, which is good. Generally, a score greater 50 indicates that you&rsquo;re doing a pretty good job with company culture. According to Huerta, though, most companies start out in the negative.This is one of the metrics the Workify uses to help its customers, it is one of two key metrics employed by <u> <a href=\"http://www.solstice-mobile.com/join-our-team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Solstice </a></u>, which consistently rates as a great place to work on sites like galssdoor.com, and by more and more large and small companies working to create the kind of company culture that will flourish in the new corporate world.A variation of this method is employed by Wrike, named the San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal as one of the best places to work in the Bay Area &ndash; a region with no small amount of stiff competition.A variation of this method is employed by Wrike, which was recently named by the San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal as <u> <a href=\"https://www.wrike.com/blog/wrike-named-best-place-work-san-francisco-bay-area\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  one of the best places to work in the Bay Area </a></u> &ndash; no small feat, given the stiff competition in the region.&ldquo;One of our company objectives,&rdquo; the company&rsquo;s founder, <u> <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-metrics-are-companies-with-engaging-employee-cultures-looking-at-to-help-create-those-environments/answer/Andrew-Filev?__snids__=1267042190&amp;__nsrc__=4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Andrew Filev, explains </a></u>, &ldquo;is &lsquo;Be the best place to work&rsquo;.&rdquo; A simple enough metric. But how to measure it? &ldquo;Because culture is difficult to quantify,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;I put a lot of thought into how to measure this. In the end I decided to keep it simple and ask people directly, in a yes or no question: Is Wrike the best company you&rsquo;ve ever worked at? So my measurable key result is written like this: &lsquo;X% of team should believe that Wrike is the best company they ever worked at.&rsquo; This is part of our OKR process (How to Use OKRs for Quarterly and Annual Planning ), so it gets good visibility and solid support through the company.&rdquo;How do they gather the answers to this very simple question? Yup. Employee surveys. &ldquo;For surveys,&rdquo; Filev says, &ldquo;we generally try to put strong emphasis on qualitative feedback, not just the numbers, so they are more insightful and actionable.&rdquo;How do they find out? Yup. Employee surveys. &ldquo;For surveys,&rdquo; Filev says, &ldquo;we generally try to put strong emphasis on qualitative feedback, not just the numbers, so they are more insightful and actionable.&rdquo;<h3> Check in via media that employees are eager (or at least willing) to use</h3>Yeah, this means smartphones. However you slice it, today&rsquo;s employees, and especially tomorrow&rsquo;s employees, like to do things &ndash; as many things as possible &ndash; through apps on their phones. Fortunately, these short surveys are perfectly suited for mobile delivery. OK, &ldquo;fortunately&rdquo; may not be the right word here. After all, fortune has very little to do with the elegant harmony that exists between mobile platforms and employee engagement metrics. These are technologies that have evolved together. Use them together. If your company doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to develop an app of its own, find a service that can gather the data on your behalf. It&rsquo;s become very clear that the modern workforce is much more inclined to answer a couple of questions that pop up as a notification on their phone than to sit down and spend 15-30 minutes answering 100 questions that all sound the same.<h3> Use the data</h3>Now to the real crux of the matter. If you want to see any ROI on your employee engagement program, you&rsquo;re going to have to use the data you collect. But again, these shorter more frequent surveys help with that as well. The more concise data they gather is much easier to wrangle and analyze. This means that instead of processing employee feedback for six months before you can even begin to consider what problems exist and what steps you might take to rectify them, you can look at it as soon as the cycle ends and take action while it is still relevant to the employees. Not only does this address weaknesses in your company&rsquo;s culture, it makes it clear to employees that you are committed to creating an environment in which they want to work and are responsive to their needs.<h3> Collect other data</h3>Now, you cannot, Huerta warns, rely only on employee surveys to keep you informed of how your company culture supports employee engagement and productivity. One of the other phenomena he has observed in working with clients, many of whom employ an increasingly &ldquo;millennial&rdquo; workforce, is that these folks love giving feedback. This is evidenced by the proliferation of feedback sites like Yelp!, TripAdvisor, and Urbanspoon, and their ilk. Part of any modern employee engagement program, then, should be a lateral avenue for providing feedback, preferably anonymous feedback. Huerta notes that 99% of the feedback submitted to clients through his company&rsquo;s platform is submitted anonymously when anonymity is an option. Employees, as it turns out, would often rather leave their job than stage a confrontation with management. An anonymous feedback channel provides an alternative.Additionally, while knowing what your employees think is certainly an essential part of creating an attractive and productive company culture, it is important to collect less subjective data as well. An article in the <u> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/11/a-primer-on-measuring-employee-engagement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Harvard Business Review </a></u> on the subject, for example, suggests monitoring how much time employees spend working outside of normal business hours as an indicator of discretionary effort. J. Schwan, the CEO of Solstice, mentioned above as one of those companies that has met with great success in its efforts to engage employees, also recommends monitoring external metrics. In an <u> article he wrote for LinkedIn</u>, he indicates that they use their <u> <a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Solstice-Mobile-EI_IE643120.11,26.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  glassdoor.com </a></u> rating to keep an eye on how things are going internally. It&rsquo;s currently 4.6 out of 5 and 90% of those who have reviewed the company on the site would recommend it to a friend, so it seems like strategy seems to be going well.<h3> Get Started Right Now</h3>&ldquo;Take look at your numbers,&rdquo; says Huerta. &ldquo;How are your retention numbers trending what does customer churn look like?&rdquo; These metrics, which you&rsquo;re no doubt already gathering, will likely tell you a lot about the state of your employee engagement. &ldquo;They tend to trend together.&rdquo;<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/F40JAs0sH0MOK3s3BJ04Bp0PF4C4M8K3Mi68H9KUg04MYDCiMi780Q079I5C1.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/F40JAs0sH0MOK3s3BJ04Bp0PF4C4M8K3Mi68H9KUg04MYDCiMi780Q079I5C1.jpg \"/></a>Take a look at your cultural DNA. Does your leadership know what this is? Do you? What is your company&rsquo;s vision, what is your mission, what is your purpose?Then, Huerta says, ask yourself these questions: 1) On a scale of 1-10 how important is culture to your business? (We hope you know the answer to this by now). 2) How important are people to culture and business?

According to research, about 60 percent of employees still print and sign documents, then <u> <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/resource/ebook-ultimate-guide-document-scanning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  scan them </a></u> back in to their document management system, while 64 percent print, sign, and file paperwork manually.And this is all happening when employees are out of the office more than ever before, between business travel and working from home.<strong> But e-signatures reportedly offer many benefits, Roe writes. For example, they allow users to:</strong><li> <strong>  Experience 80 percent faster turnaround time </strong></li><li> <strong>  Save $20 per document </strong></li><li> <strong>  Generate five times more customer loyalty </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ship 117 percent more proposals per rep and per month than non-users </strong></li><li> <strong>  See ROI within six months (37% of the time) </strong></li><img alt=\"\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/keyboard.jpg\" width=\"350\"/>One of the things that&rsquo;s held e-signatures back is the lack of a notary. But along with e-signatures, there are<u> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/realestate/the-e-notary-public-is-slow-to-catch-on.html\" target=\"_blank\">  now e-notaries </a></u>, at least in Virginia, writes the New York Times.&ldquo;As of 2012, Virginia became the <u> first state to allow certified notaries to use technology</u> to notarize documents remotely, with the signers being anywhere in the world,&rdquo; the paper writes. &ldquo;Signers must appear before the notary by means of a live, two-way video conference, and the notary must keep a recording of the meeting.&rdquo;Meanwhile, supporters of e-signatures still have to struggle sometimes. For example, in Kentucky,  <u> Independent gubernatorial candidate Drew Curtis</u> was recently told by Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky&rsquo;s chief election official, that online signatures wouldn&rsquo;t count toward his petition because the office wouldn&rsquo;t be able to compare signatures with voter identification cards.So just how does someone celebrate ESIGN Day, anyway?

I&rsquo;m in the final stages of authoring a book on values-driven leadership. My premise is that whether you are a celebrity, an individual leader, or a corporation managing your brand reputation &ndash; if your internal reality and your external marketing is not governed by the same set of core values, then one of your faces is lying.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> Yes, exactly, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> In the short term it might feel like a good idea to present something that is not real to the world in order to make a quick buck, but in the long-term that will backfire big time.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> Yeah, I agree.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> I get a lot of people who say, &ldquo;Wow, this is amazing, more people need to be thinking this way, but it&rsquo;s hard to figure out how to follow through.&rdquo; Other people say, &ldquo;Yeah, you can&rsquo;t do that, you can&rsquo;t be wildly successful in business without cutting corners.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> That&rsquo;s absolute unmitigated horse manure. I don&rsquo;t know how you can succeed without living the same face both directions. I suppose it might be possible, but I don&rsquo;t believe it really happens. Not in the long haul. It can&rsquo;t create a sustainable culture.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> I&rsquo;m aware that in 2013 Chipotle outstripped Starbucks and McDonald&rsquo;s by 9-10%. I know that you and Steve Ells held co-spots at number four on Fortune Magazine&rsquo;s 2014 Business Person of the Year list. I watched one of your Mad Money interviews when Jim Cramer asked you, &ldquo;How do you achieve a values-driven corporate culture throughout a large chain with so many locations when you&rsquo;ve had such explosive rapid growth?&rdquo; And you said that your employees are taught to look at people and know them. Tell me more about that.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> We start out by trying to hire the right kind of people for Chipotle, hiring is very important. We hire an extraordinary number of employees &ndash; 50, 60, 70 thousand people a year.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> That&rsquo;s a big job.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> Yeah, when we hire we don&rsquo;t care about experience at all. We&rsquo;ve always insisted on hiring people with what we call the 13 characteristics, which I came up with, that I do not believe can be taught. By the time you are 10 or 12 years old you either have them or you don&rsquo;t.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Wow!</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> I don&rsquo;t want to hire people who lack those characteristics and then try to teach them, because it&rsquo;s an exercise in futility. Once you hire people for character, you have a better chance of getting people who can be sensitive and open and understanding, and caring about the people around them. Before I came, Chipotle hired for experience, which was as often a disadvantage as it was an advantage. It was very hard to break employees of terrible &ldquo;fast food industry&rdquo; habits.</p><p> Once we hire people, our foundational principle is that each person will be judged and rewarded based on their effectiveness in making the people around themselves better. And that foundational principle drives everything we do in regards to how we compensate, how we promote, who becomes our future leaders, who we exalt, who we hold up as examples of great leaders.</p><p> When I started, only 18% to 20% made it from crew to manager. Now, all of our GMs come from crew except for a scarce few. First you hire people who are fantastic, then you operate on this foundational principle, then you start rewarding people based on their effectiveness in making others better. Then you see your younger leaders in the company start trying to help the people around them.</p><p> And when they do, you make heroes out of them, you announce it, you promote them. Every single promotion we make in the company of any consequence, we share why they got the promotion. And the reason is always: &ldquo;this guy makes others better, this lady makes others better, look at what she&rsquo;s done. She&rsquo;s took this many crew and turned them into managers. She took that one and turned him into a restaurateur, etc.&rdquo;</p><p> We celebrate the successes of making others better. Once people start to see, &ldquo;Oh my God, they really do reward you when you make others better&hellip; &rdquo; what happens is a multifold win.</p><p> First, you get lots of people who are being developed. </p><p> Second, you get people who start to love each other and realize what it means to care about someone, to devote themselves to someone, to commit and empower somebody.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-15 14:52:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-15 14:52:00.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_iFs6fC2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/chatting-with-chipotles-ceo-empowerment-part-i/\", \"post_id\": \"6091\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-15 14:52:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-15 14:52:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"chatting-with-chipotles-ceo-empowerment-part-i\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6090\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2790\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-7.53.23-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"862\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442426400,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}

This is the case in inspiration versus influence.</p><p> A thesaurus helps us here!</p><p> <strong>  Some INFLUENCE thesaurus entries: </strong></p><li> effect result</li><li> shape power</li><li> mold outcome</li><li> charm force</li><li> act upon determining factor</li><p> <br/> <strong>  INSPIRATION entries: </strong></p><li> divine guidance</li><li> thought intuition</li><li> idea inhalation</li><li> aspiration</li><p> <br/> Many times, a musician or writer will be asked, &ldquo;Who are your influences?&rdquo; In reality, apart from an ongoing relationship with a mentor, the word inspiration better fits a question of style.</p><p> Cynthia Morris, of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.originalimpulse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.originalimpulse.com  </a> </u> , describes the difference as:</p><p> <strong>  Inspiration sparks an emotional quickening. It uplifts, infuses us with hope, generates new ideas and gives us the sense of possibility and faith. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Influence exerts a specific, directive force to provoke change on a sometimes daily or consistent basis. Influence makes things happen. </strong></p><p> Inspiration doesn&rsquo;t have intent. We take our inspiration and do what we will with it. Influence has a goal, and end game. You can be someone&rsquo;s inspiration without knowing you are. Influencing others requires a conscience awareness of the influence actions from the influencer. Inspiration is passive. Influence is active and intentional.</p><h3> Motivation vs. Influence</h3><p> <br/> Another word that frequently enters our vernacular and is used interchangeably with influence is &ldquo;motivate.&rdquo; There is again a difference here. Motivating' requires giving someone a 'motive', usually self-interest or self-preservation along the lines; while influencing is a higher-level skill that makes the desired action their idea.</p><p> One adage says,</p><p> <strong>  Motivation gets you going. Influence is what makes you go in a particular direction. </strong></p><p> But aren&rsquo;t we as humans always motivated, even if that motivation is to sit on the couch, eating potato chips, and watching soap operas? Something is driving our deepest affections, whether that is to veg-out or train for a marathon. Influence is what takes us in a particular direction.</p><h3> Influence Wins</h3><p> <br/> Influence is the primary ingredient needed to move others toward an objective. Influence best happens when it is intrinsic, as extrinsic motivation is fleeting. Money, perks, and extra time off are temporary and are not tied to the actual task at hand. Those motivated by them can quickly disassociate from the mission as soon as better money, perks and extra time is offered by a less noble cause or objective. But&hellip;let someone understand THE WHY and they will see the objective itself as vital. In this case they will be influenced to join arms and march the streets of Selma for no pay while in fact putting themselves in danger. Build THE WHY into a team and you&rsquo;ll have a soldier risking his life to get a fellow injured soldier out of harms way. At that moment, he won&rsquo;t be thinking about a medal as motivation, rather the influence that has been poured into him will take hold as he risks life and limb to not leave any man behind.</p><h3> The Two Roles of Influencers</h3><p> <br/> The world is filled with shallow motivators, able to inspire people for short-sprints, but soon that wanes. What the business world needs is influential leaders who view themselves as WHY-TEACHERS and POTENTIAL EXPANDERS.</p><p> <strong>  WHY TEACHERS </strong></p><p> Simon Sinek is the current leading spokesman about why THE WHY is so important.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t seen his TED Talk on Start With Why, please do yourself a huge favor and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sioZd3AxmnE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   view it here  </a> </u> .</p><p> Spend a majority of your time teaching others WHY the dream is important, and soon you&rsquo;ll find yourself with an army of committed volunteers. The best influencers don&rsquo;t just know what they do and how they do it, but WHY the organization exists and why should anyone care. Get people to believe in the WHY, and they are bought in for life.</p><p> The great influencers think backwards, starting with THE WHY. The what and the how merely support THE WHY. (See Simon Sinek&rsquo;s Apple example in the video above).</p><h3> Potential Expanders</h3><p> <br/> A few people think highly of themselves in this world, but most wonder, &ldquo;Do I really have what it takes?&rdquo;  They significantly undervalue their potential. This means there is untapped energy and solutions that remain trapped deep inside people, corked by self-doubt. A true influencer realizes that uncorking the bottle is key to growing people.</p><p> Athletic coaches are famous for getting more out of their athletes than the athlete ever thought possible. In fact, the newest research on cyclist suggests the &ldquo;quit factor&rdquo; occurs in the mental sphere long before the physiological limits truly take full effect.</p><p> The classic scene from the movie  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-sUKoKQlEC4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facing the Giants  </a> </u>  is a fantastic visual picture of this.</p><p> Think of the favorite leaders under whom you have served? They probably pressed you and squeezed more talent and energy out of you than you ever imagined was within you. They probably drove you mad at times as they popped the cork of self-limitations, BUT THEY INFLUENCED YOU!</p><h3> The Challenge of Influence</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t take the easy way out using only nebulous inspirational poster or temporary motivation tactics. Tap into your ability to TRULY influence others. The potential IS within you (see, I am acting as your coach right now). The WHY of my life is to help others grow in their influence. The what is the Keller Influence Indicator&reg;, developed to help me accomplish the WHY. This assessment let&rsquo;s you uncork your potential and then proceed to develop your own WHY and influence others to buy into that vision. Soon you&rsquo;ll be influencing others to increase THEIR influence. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-15 15:31:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-15 15:31:34.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_WC42w1b.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/influence-vs-inspiration-vs-motivation-understanding-why-influence-wins-in-the-end/\", \"post_id\": \"6093\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-15 15:31:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-15 15:31:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"influence-vs-inspiration-vs-motivation-understanding-why-influence-wins-in-the-end\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6092\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2791\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-14-at-6.46.56-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"847\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442403900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2721,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 PR Lessons for Financial Firms in the Face of Market Turmoil","link":"5-pr-lessons-for-financial-firms-in-the-face-of-market-turmoil","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenmicklow?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jen Micklow  </a> </u> When advisers worry about quelling investors&rsquo; fight-or-flight response in times of financial turbulence, their instincts might tell them to become more insular in the way they operate &ndash; a &ldquo;batten down the hatches&rdquo; approach during stormy times. But, as we&rsquo;ve witnessed many times before, a calm voice of reason in an otherwise noisy stew of negativity can help counter any pain an adviser&rsquo;s business might face during periods of market mayhem.Here are five of our go-to tips for meeting bad headlines head on, whether it&rsquo;s related to a significant market correction or a more specific failure of a preferred market instrument (remember the &ldquo;break the buck&rdquo; moment money markets faced?):</p><li> <strong>  Conduct due diligence. </strong>  Learn everything you can about the issue (in this case, market volatility and its impact on investments &ndash; What factors led to the downtrend? Who does it affect? What&rsquo;s being done about it? What are other experts saying?). Gauge public perception by listening to clients, reading articles and sifting through comments, and scouring social media to better understand how investors feel. Once you know their concerns, you can craft a response to address them.</li><li> <strong>  Develop strategic messaging. </strong>  Envision your ideal end result &ndash; here, perhaps your objective is to keep investors calm and reduce a mass exodus from the market or from investing altogether. Then, think about what you learned during your research and how it affects your goal. Assess potential threats, identify opportunities and map out thoughtful, informative talking points containing your key messages. Brainstorm possible questions from investors and the media and incorporate those responses into your messages. Make sure each person on your team is informed of your collective stance and designate key contacts to disseminate information publicly.</li><li> <strong>  Refine your media skills. </strong>  Again, trust comes into play here &ndash; you must project confidence to reassure investors that you know what you&rsquo;re talking about. A nervous spokesperson in a shaky market adds to investors&rsquo; fears and detracts from the messaging you so carefully crafted. Convey competence, concern and candor in all conversations with the media. For TV appearances, own your talking points, maintain eye contact, steady your voice and perfect your posture &ndash; staying poised speaks volumes.</li><li> <strong>  Remind your audience why they trust you. </strong>  Sure, investors are scared, but market volatility is natural. Acknowledge their fears and provide reassurance that this, too, shall pass. Position yourself as a thought leader and subject matter expert through blogs, social media and targeted media relations efforts. Discuss past market volatility, the current situation, your plan of attack and why your strategy is an effective one.</li><li> <strong>  Monitor ongoing chatter.  </strong> Remember our first tip &ndash; conduct due diligence? Repeat as necessary, for as long as necessary. Continue to monitor the evolution of the issue at hand and the public&rsquo;s reactions, tweak your talking points as needed and respond to investors&rsquo; and the media&rsquo;s inquiries in a timely fashion.</li>If all else fails, remember these takeaways: be informed, be transparent, and be timely. Know the subject matter; commit to factual, uniform messaging; and be quick to communicate with your stakeholders.Crises notwithstanding, credibility and trust &ndash; the foundation of any successful adviser-investor relationship &ndash; are the key ingredients for a successful approach to public relations. Building and maintaining those key components of your business requires unique skills, especially during periods of market turbulence when investors&rsquo; confidence is upended.We counsel clients on best practices and help financial services professionals navigate difficult situations to maintain client relationships, polish images, and protect businesses regardless of (or in response to) any roadblocks.<strong> Preparation is key, and arming yourself with an effective crisis communications plan can help ensure you are able to weather the storm of the next turbulent market.</strong>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-15 16:38:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-15 16:38:09.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_vkZOwV5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-pr-lessons-for-financial-firms-in-the-face-of-market-turmoil/\", \"post_id\": \"6097\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-15 16:38:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-15 16:38:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-pr-lessons-for-financial-firms-in-the-face-of-market-turmoil\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6096\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2793\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-9.39.30-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"601\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442404800,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2722,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Steps to Genius","link":"7-steps-to-genius","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Science of People  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  What do geniuses do differently? </strong></p><p> Do they have a unique morning routine? Interesting daily rituals?</p><p> To answer these questions, let us turn to one of the most brilliant minds in history: Leonardo da Vinci.</p><p> You might know Da Vinci as an artist, but he was also an architect, scientist, musician, mathematician, inventor, anatomist, geologist, astronomer, cartographer, botanist, historian and writer. He didn&rsquo;t just excel in one area, but rather he flourished across disciplines and created concepts that have lasted for centuries. Da Vinci had a very specific approach to life that anyone can learn. In this post, I will show you how:</p><p> You can develop your essential elements of genius.</p><p> Michael J. Gelb excavated Da Vinci&rsquo;s notebooks, writings and creations to figure out how he thought and lived differently. He found:</p><h3> The 7 Da Vincian Principles</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440508827/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0440508827&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=A6OM6E6NXGM63AJB\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p><p> I chose  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440508827/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0440508827&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=A6OM6E6NXGM63AJB\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci </a>  for our Science of People book club because I thought it was a fascinating look into the daily habits of a genius. Gelb explores how Da Vinci approached life and, most importantly, lays it out for readers in a practical framework for self-improvement.</p><p> If you didn&rsquo;t get a chance to read the book&ndash;which I highly recommend since it is filled with Da Vinci&rsquo;s original drawings and illustrations, I have outlined the 7 Da Vincian Principles for you here:</p><h3> #1: Curiosit&agrave;</h3><p> <br/> Curiosita is an insatiably curious approach to life and unrelenting quest for continuous learning.</p><p> Da Vinci is not the only one who embodied a seemingly infinite supply of curiosity. Many of history&rsquo;s great inventors and leaders had the desire to unlock the mysteries of life. If you&rsquo;re like me, this one seems fairly obvious and something you already know is important. So, I think about curiosity in 2 basic questions:</p><li> What if?</li><li> How come? <br/>  </li><p> I know I am embracing curiosity if I ask myself these 2 questions multiple times each day.</p><p> What If: Asks your brain to project into the future. It helps you see opportunities where you might have missed them, it helps you make connections and it is a sneaky way to get your brain more goal-oriented. What if I started a conversation with this person? What if I tried this new activity? What if I started that new workout program? What comes after &lsquo;what if&hellip;&rsquo; is typically magical.</p><p> How Come: How come gets you into &lsquo;why&rsquo;. Instead of passively observing the world or going into automatic responses, &lsquo;how come&rsquo; helps you question both your actions and other&rsquo;s motives. I believe this question keeps me honest and alert. It forces me to live more purposefully. Da Vinci didn&rsquo;t waste a second of his life. He was always creating and guessing and tinkering. &lsquo;How come&rsquo; helps you use every second of your life with a mission.</p><p> Here are some ways you can capture more Curiosita:</p><li> A Hundred Questions: Write down 100 questions that are important to you. These could be questions you wish to answer yourself such as, &ldquo;What is my purpose?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is the meaning of life?&rdquo; or questions you want to know about everyone you meet like, &ldquo;What is your passion? or &ldquo;What makes you happy?&rdquo; This is the ultimate &lsquo;what if&rsquo; and &lsquo;how come&rsquo; exercise.</li><li> Ten Power Questions: After you have brainstormed a list of 100 questions, select the 10 that have the most powerful impact when you read them. Which ones spark a feeling of motivation or achievement? These are your catalyst questions. For example: <li>  When am I most naturally myself? </li> <li>  What is my greatest talent? </li> <li>  What is my heart&rsquo;s deepest desire? </li></li><li> Daily Themes: Da Vinci was an avid writer and note taker. He had a journal everywhere he went. I have a journal at my desk AND at my bed to take notes when all kinds of ideas pop into my head. Carry a journal with you everywhere and write down your ideas and observations. Each day, choose a theme or word. You can do this at the beginning of the day to set the intention or at the end of the day as a cool down or wrap-up. <br/>  </li><h3> #2: Dimostrazione</h3><p> <br/> Dimostrazione is a commitment to test knowledge through experience, persistence and a willingness to learn from mistakes.</p><p> I love this principle, because it is empowering. Dimostrazione is the embodiment of taking your life into your own hands. This principle tells us:</p><p> Test every idea.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t take anything for granted.</p><p> Experience life first hand.</p><p> I believe life should be an experiment. That we should have a series of amazing hypotheses every day, and we should be testing them. A hypothesis consists of a 2 part statement:</p><p> If&hellip;, then&hellip;</p><p> For example, if I take this personal development class, then I hope to be happier. Or as small as if I reorganize my closet, then it will be easier to get ready in the morning. The &lsquo;If&hellip;, then&hellip;&rsquo; exercise puts you into opportunity-hunting mindset, so you are always looking for and testing solutions.</p><p> Here are some ways you can capture more Dimostrazione:</p><li> Find Your Greats: You have probably heard of all the most popular artists and authors, but who are your favorites? Set out to find your greats. Don&rsquo;t take anyone else&rsquo;s word for it. Start your own search for the artists, classical musicians or writers that inspire you. Go to a museum and look at the paintings without glancing at the names.</li><li> Be Devil&rsquo;s Advocate: Try playing devil&rsquo;s advocate against yourself. Try making the strongest possible argument against one of your own beliefs just for the mental exercise. Write at least 3 points against yourself. <br/>  </li><h3> #3: Sensazione</h3><p> <br/> Sensazione is the continual refinement of the senses, especially sight, as the means to enliven experience.</p><p> Fill in the blank:</p><p> ___is so beautiful.</p><p> I love the way _____ smells.</p><p> What a lovely _____.</p><p> I adore the feeling of ____ on my skin.</p><p> The sound of ____ is music to my ears.</p><p> We forget to savor and sensualize our experiences. We have all heard &lsquo;stop and smell the roses,&rsquo; but when was the last time you actually stopped and smelled the roses? Sure, literal roses, but also metaphorical roses. When was the last time you stopped to savor an experience? Da Vinci was incredibly inspired by the world around him and the more he honed his senses, the more heightened his genius became.</p><p> Here are some ways you can capture more Sensazione:</p><li> A Sense a Day: Plan out 5 experiences in the next few months where you practice honoring each of your senses. <li>  For smell, go to the local botanical gardens, make your own perfume or cologne and learn to recognize herbs by their scent at the local grocery store. </li> <li>  For taste, (this one is easy!) eat a bunch of your favorite foods and try one new cuisine. Figure out your favorite spice. </li> <li>  For sight, go to your local museum, then hike to a vista or view point and learn some new photography techniques. </li> <li>  For touch, go to your local animal shelter and volunteer petting pups and kitties. Go through your closet and organize it by fabric. Go shopping and try to buy one new fabric you have never owned before &mdash; suede? Velvet? Flannel? </li> <li>  For hearing, go to a concert, stop by your local music store and try to play an instrument you have never heard before. If you are really ambitious, try to learn   <a href=\"http://www.bioacoustica.org/gallery/aves_eng.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bird mating calls  </a>   or spend some time trying to draw sound. For example, if you had to draw the sound of a trumpet, how would you do it? (mine looks like a messy swirl).  <br/>    </li></li><h3> #4: Sfumato</h3><p> <br/> Sfumato is a willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox, and uncertainty. Da Vinci had a very unique ability to understand the extreme opposites of opinions and phenomenon. He was also able to explore unknowns and revel in the uncertainty. Most of us are uncomfortable with not knowing or unanswerable questions, so we avoid anything out of our control. We stick to what we know and immediately do a Google search the moment we don&rsquo;t know something.</p><p> A Story:</p><p> The other day, I was hiking with some friends in Columbia Gorge (one of the most beautiful places in the world) and we began passing all of these old wagons&ndash;like really, really old wagons. Now, I live in Oregon very close to the end of the Oregon Trail where Lewis and Clark explored, so we started to wonder if the wagons were somehow connected to the Oregon Trail. The more wagons we passed, the more perplexed we got. We had no service where we were hiking, so we couldn&rsquo;t just whip out our phones and consult Google. This began to drive us crazy. We are so used to knowing things or being able to figure things out almost instantly, that it was driving us nuts to not know. But a cool thing happened. We started to brainstorm all of the different reasons that all of these wagons were on the trail&ndash;a massive flood carried them across the plains, a wagon cult lived in the woods nearby, etc. And that was a really hilarious and fun exercise. It reminded me of the Sfumato principle that not knowing is actually the best mental activity. You search, you think, you create.</p><p> *We eventually Googled it and found out we had stumbled upon a  <u>  <a href=\"http://trails.gorgefriends.org/trail/weldon-wagon-trail/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1900 wagon trail  </a> </u>  that used to transport apples.</p><p> Here are some ways you can capture more Sfumato:</p><li> Stop Googling: For the next week, anytime you need to look up a word or trivia fact, try to guess the answer instead. You can phone a friend for help as well, as long as they brainstorm with you too!</li><li> Embrace Your Ambiguity: List some situations from your life where you are confused or feel ambiguous about an outcome and explore the feelings that come up.</li><li> Cultivate Confusion Endurance: Tap into your own paradoxes by asking questions like, &ldquo;How are my strengths and weaknesses related?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is the relationship between my saddest moments and the most joyful ones?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> #5: Arte/Scienza</h3><p> <br/> Arte/scienza is the development of the balance between science and art, logic and imagination.</p><p> Although Da Vinci wasn&rsquo;t around for the research on right and left brain thinking, this concept speaks directly to the idea of whole brain thinking. Mark the statements that sound like you:</p><p> Right Brained:</p><p> ___ I like details</p><p> ___ I am almost always on time</p><p> ___ I rely on logic</p><p> ___ I am skilled at math</p><p> ___ I am organized and disciplined</p><p> ___ I like lists</p><p> Left Brained:</p><p> ___  I am highly imaginative</p><p> ___ I am good at brainstorming</p><p> ___ I love to doodle</p><p> ___ I often say or do the unexpected</p><p> ___ I rely on intuition</p><p> ___I often lose track of time</p><p> Which one had more statements that you agreed with? Were you balanced? Da Vinci was a big believer in using both parts of your brain. He did this in his notebooks by tying ideas with drawings. Specifically, he was the original mind-mapper. Here is a cool overview on mindmapping:</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nMZCghZ1hB4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-10.14.57-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><p> Here are some ways you can capture more Arte/scienza:</p><li> Warm-up by mind-mapping the main ideas in your favorite TED Talk. Here are my favorites:</li><p> <strong>  Amy Cuddy: </strong> <br/> <br/> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ks-_Mh1QhMc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-10.17.18-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><strong> Cameron Russell:</strong><br/> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"636\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-10.47.40-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/></a> <li> Create a mind map of your life: Have you ever thought about how the different parts of your life are connected? Make a mind map of your major life moments and how they are connected.</li><li> Here is a pretty cool  <a href=\"https://litemind.com/mindmaps/how-to-think-like-leonardo-da-vinci/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mind map of the book </a> :</li><br /><h3> #6: Corporalit&aacute;</h3><p> <br/> Corporalita is the cultivation of grace, ambidexterity, fitness and poise. Da Vinci was incredibly athletic in addition to his mental prowess. From early on, he realized that if he wanted his mind to perform at optimal levels, his body also had to be in top shape.</p><p> I couldn&rsquo;t agree with this more. If I have a bad night&rsquo;s sleep, my work suffers. If I don&rsquo;t eat well, my energy slows. If I don&rsquo;t get enough movement, my back kills me.</p><p> Here are some ways you can capture more Corporalita:</p><li> Learn the  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/06/the-science-of-eating/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Science of Eating </a> : I did a whole post on the science of eating on some really easy ways to make your food intake more purposeful.</li><li> Get on a Sleep Schedule: Everyone has different sleep needs and different sleep rhythms. For the next week, track your sleep times and hours and see which days you have the most energy. Are you a night worker? A morning person? Learn your cycles and then honor them by building a sleep routine.</li><li> Cultivate Ambidexterity: Da Vinci used both his right and left hands as he worked. You can do this by trying to brush your teeth with your non dominant hand or get a really patient person to play a game of pool, tennis or catch where you switch hands! <br/>  </li><h3> #7: Connessione</h3><p> <br/> Connessione is a recognition of and appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things and phenomena.</p><p> I think this is one of the most complex and interesting Da Vincian principles. It has to do with something called &lsquo;systems thinking&rsquo;. Systems thinking is when you are able to take vast amounts of information and create routines, lists and organization. It also has to do with pattern recognition. I LOVE connessione. As many of you know, I have a number of courses and books&ndash;my favorite part of the curriculum creation process is taking huge amounts of research and condensing it down into an outline. I also love hunting for patterns. In our human behavior research lab, I am constantly looking for patterns in body language, thinking and relationships. For example:</p><li> In my  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/happiness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  School of Happiness course </a> , I had 128 pages of research and notes to condense into a 10 week program.</li><li> For my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/people-skills/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Master Your People Skills course  </a> </u> , we had over 7,000 people take our body language and personality surveys. We had to pour over the data to find patterns to make the course.</li><li> For our next book, I will be using 9 years of research, over 2,400 studies and 356 in-depth interviews! <br/>  </li><p> When you can create systems and recognize patterns in your life, you are able to cultivate true genius.</p><p> Here are some ways you can capture more Connessione:</p><li> What&rsquo;s Your Book Outline? If you had to create a table of contents for a book about your life, what would it be if you couldn&rsquo;t make it chronological?</li><li> 3 Objects: Pick 3 random objects in your house. If you had to find connections between them, what would they be? For example, I chose my blender, my garage clicker and a bottle of nail polish. Can you think of three connections? I thought: With all three of these things, the faster they work, the better. The faster the blender, the better the smoothie, the faster the garage door opens, the faster I get home and the faster my polish dries, the less risk there is of my mushing up my toe nails. This is a great one to play with kids! <br/>  </li><h3> Bonus: Felicit&agrave;</h3><p> Felicit&agrave; is the cultivation of deep joy, happiness and life fulfillment.</p><p> Looking over Da Vinci&rsquo;s masterpieces, inventions and works of genius, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about his happiness levels. Did his genius fulfill him? Does an active mind mean an active heart? I have been studying the science of happiness in our labs and I think joy is an essential part of genius. <strong>  I&rsquo;ll be presenting all of my findings in a FREE class on September 16th at 12pm PST!

{"original_id":2723,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Getting Personal About Privacy","link":"getting-personal-about-privacy","source_link":null,"content":"<strong> Thirty years ago, it happened to me. Someone I knew well, a friend who had spent time in my home and who had access to my personal information, stole my identity.</strong>Identity and data privacy is all over the news today, but back then it never occurred to me to keep my driver&rsquo;s license, social security number, and financial records under lock and key&mdash;especially from someone who knew my birthday by heart. And yet my privacy was violated, and my information was used to rent property and open lines of credit in my name. Not only was it a personal blow, but the credit aftermath was an absolute nightmare. I spent months correcting information and attempting to clean up my credit score, and 30 years later some of those false addresses remain attached to my name. The event plagues me to this day. As a result, I&rsquo;m a bit obsessive about the privacy of personal and financial information. Privacy matters. Here&rsquo;s why:The data-sharing aspect of the internet has shifted the way we work, the way we shop, and the way we communicate. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also made it easier for sophisticated hackers to grab personal information and use it for criminal activity using these key forms of fraud:<img alt=\"b2ap3_thumbnail_idtheft_catergory_graph.gif\" src=\"https://kleinadvisors.advisorproducts.com/images/easyblog_images/705/b2ap3_thumbnail_idtheft_catergory_graph.gif\"/>It&rsquo;s a widespread problem, and it&rsquo;s only getting worse. During the 2013 holiday season, <u> <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/40-million-card-accounts-affected-security-breach-target-21279\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  hackersstole 40 million debit and credit card numbers from Target </a></u>. <u> <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/neiman-marcus-hack-widespread-initially-feared-22793\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Neiman Marcus </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/michaels-breach-exposed-3-million-cards-23859\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Michael&rsquo;s </a></u> were hit the next January, and the 2014 epidemic continued with breaches at <u> <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/p-f-changs-data-breach-spans-33-restaurants-16-states-25949\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  P.F. Chang&rsquo;s China Bistro </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/supermarket-chains-hacked-credit-card-data-26726\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Albertson&rsquo;s </a></u>, and <u> <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/ups-stores-reveals-data-breach-51-stores-26855\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  UPS </a></u>. This year, the IRS announced a huge breach in which stolen Social Security numbers were used to file more than $39 million in fraudulent tax refunds. Just last month, <u> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/17/423893626/ucla-health-says-4-5m-may-be-affected-in-data-breach\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  UCLA Health </a></u> announced that hackers had gained access to the personal information of more than 4.5 million people.Clearly, no matter how quickly the government or other organizations and corporations work to fight new attacks, hackers are working just as furiously to identify new ways into the systems that house our personal data.The result: there&rsquo;s a better chance than ever that, sooner or later, you too will be a victim of fraud. And while you may not be able to prevent criminals from accessing your data held in someone else&rsquo;s database, start with these basic steps to keep your data as secure as possible.<h3> 1. Make &ldquo;password hygiene&rdquo; a priority.</h3>Passwords are a necessary evil for protecting your information. The new iPhones and iPads use fingerprint authentication for access (it all feels very James Bond!), but for other devices and online accounts, it&rsquo;s important to <a href=\"http://www.computersecurity.com/white_papers/creating-a-password.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> use strong passwords</a> and to change them regularly. Never write passwords on Post-its, in notebooks, or saved in a Word file. Instead, consider using an encrypted password management app like <u> <a href=\"https://keepersecurity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  KeeperSecurity </a></u>.<h3> 2. Be cautious when shopping online.</h3>E-commerce consumer sales hit $1.5 trillion last year. That&rsquo;s a lot of online shopping&mdash;and a lot of opportunity for online theft. Internet scams are becoming more elaborate, so be sure any site you use encrypts your personal information. If the company&rsquo;s URL begins with &ldquo;https&rdquo; (note the &lsquo;s&rsquo; for &lsquo;secure&rsquo;) or has a padlock icon next to it, security measures are in place to protect your personal information. Only use a private internet connection for banking or making purchases&mdash;never enter secure information when using a public wifi. My personal rule: use credit cards&mdash;not debit cards&mdash;when shopping online to protect your cash in case of fraud.<h3> 3. Shred documents that contain personal information.</h3>Shredding may seem like a basic practice, and while (I hope!) you&rsquo;re not tossing your bank statements into the trash, it&rsquo;s easy to forget how much personal information is included on bills, receipts, forms, insurance statements, and other records. Criminals can use this information to piece together data to create fraudulent accounts in your name. When you can, opt-in for electronic communications, but be sure to remove and destroy all downloaded information and stored passwords before recycling or donating your computer.<h3> 4. Protect your personal information.</h3>No matter how much trust you have in those around you, remove the temptation by protecting your personal data&mdash;especially your Social Security number&mdash;even in your own home. When you do need to share information (when making a purchase, completing a transaction, etc.), take similar steps to protect yourself. Never provide personal or financial data to a caller, no matter who they claim to be; legitimate sources value your security and will not ask you for secure data over the phone. The IRS NEVER, EVER calls by phone. Financial institutions don&rsquo;t ask for sensitive information via email, so if you receive a legitimate-looking email asking you to click on a mysterious link or requesting your Social Security number or password, call the official customer service number or go directly to the known website. Never use the &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; link provided in the email.<h3> 5. Check your credit activity and financial accounts regularly.</h3>Monitoring your credit report information, account balances, and financial transactions regularly can help catch fraud and stop it before it becomes a problem. I use a personal financial management app from Intuit called <u> <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mint </a></u> to receive activity alerts and pending charges to my credit accounts, and automated account alerts from <u> <a href=\"https://www.chase.com/digital/alerts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Chase </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/fraud-protection-center/how-we-protect-you.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  American Express </a></u>. <u> <a href=\"https://www.creditkarma.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CreditKarma </a></u> offers a free credit monitoring service that will notify you when something significant changes on your credit report. And requesting and reviewing your free credit reports each year from <u> <a href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AnnualCreditReport </a></u> can help you identify and rectify any issues to help maintain an accurate credit score. If you are dealing with fraud, consider placing a <u> <a href=\"http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs\" target=\"_blank\">  credit freeze </a></u> on your account that requires institutions contact you before approving any new request for credit.<h3> It&rsquo;s happened to me! What now?</h3>If, despite the best precautions, you are a victim of fraud, contact your financial institutions and the appropriate government agencies immediately to prevent additional theft. Here&rsquo;s a quick list offraud-related agencies that can help:<strong> Federal Trade Commission (FTC): (877) ID THEFT</strong><strong> Social Security Administration: (800) 269-0271</strong><strong> Internal Revenue Service (IRS): (800) 829-0433</strong><strong> Creditbureaus:</strong><strong> Equifax: (800) 525-6285</strong><strong> Experian: (888) 397-3742</strong><strong> Trans Union: (800) 680-7289</strong>Yes, fraud can be difficult to manage, but it is possible to reduce any long-term impact on your credit. The key is to take an active role in protecting your privacy, and take swift action if you do fall victim to a scheme.

{"original_id":2724,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Areas to Upgrade Your Effectiveness","link":"10-areas-to-upgrade-your-effectiveness","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;How can my organization be even more effective?\" It's a great question from my clients, and one answered first and foremost as an &ldquo;inside job&rdquo;&mdash;that is, I suggest and help the executive to look at their own leadership choices in 10 practical areas and identify opportunities for improvement.</p><p> <strong>  Thinking about your own leadership and organization, how about giving it a try? Here's how: </strong></p><p> Below I explain the factors, and attached, you'll find a do-it-yourself evaluation sheet that walks you through an assessment, and asks you to identify actions you can take. The stronger you are in each of these areas, the higher the likelihood for success for all you hope to achieve.</p><h3> On to the 10 factors:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Factor One: Select and retain highly capable, self-motivated people to do the job, and avoid hanging on to others. </strong> <br/> <br/> Getting the right people on board and the wrong people out can be a challenge. A VERY common error is to hang on to chronically low-performing people. A capable, self-motivated person can make the difference between a good outcome and a great one, while someone lacking these qualities will drag you down. Setting high standards for the people you choose, and not hanging on to others, is critical to any objective.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Two: Give your people clear guidelines, and then let them deliver in their own way&mdash;don&rsquo;t hover or micromanage. </strong> <br/> <br/> To get the most out of your excellent people, show them the game, playing field, and the values, guidelines, and milestones required to win. Then, let them play in their own way. This requires trust and verification on your part, but it is more effective than riding herd over them. Your team needs clarity from you about values, deadlines, revenue, cost, and how you define success&mdash;what will literally delight you. By combining clear guidelines and good delegation, you increase the likelihood of success, and also retain your outstanding players. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Three: Give your people a sharp picture of the desired outcome from the start.  </strong> <br/> <br/> Projects and businesses can fail because the definition of what you hope to achieve is fuzzy or a moving target. Take all of the necessary time to define up front what measurable outcomes will delight you. Studies show vagueness about key outcomes often leads to failure. Go over it repeatedly with your team until any assumptions are replaced with actual information. Leaders who have the courage to pause and clarify outcomes significantly increase the likelihood of success. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Four: Create a culture where people are rewarded for being brutally honest.  </strong> <br/> <br/> Extraordinary results require a culture in which those you lead are rewarded for telling the grit-your-teeth truth. Take inventory of the culture you are creating, and be on the lookout for hesitation when it comes to full disclosure. By modeling and inviting brutal honesty, you enable your team to detect its own errors, and correct them, while providing you the &ldquo;real story,&rdquo; on which you can base smart leadership decisions. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Five: Supply adequate resources to the task at hand. </strong>   <br/> <br/> Problems are often caused by either a shortage or a glut of resources. The fast-paced culture in the workplace tempts us to jump in now and be more precise about resource needs later. It takes leadership to carve out the time to calculate resource needs from the very beginning. By doing great job of allocating resources from the start, you stand a better chance of success. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Six: Challenge your people by setting a high bar. </strong> <br/> <br/> Capable, self-motivated people tend to work best when they are truly challenged. It is important to understand what motivates each key person, and set expectations within their grasp yet beyond their immediate reach. This keeps it interesting enough for them, producing a positive creative tension. Your best people are then more likely to run at full speed, even as you improve the chances for success. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Seven: Implement simple yet profound measurements for success and failure. </strong> <br/> <br/> How do you measure success? How do you know if you failed? If it&rsquo;s not crystal-clear, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to look more closely at your definitions of each. A great and simple measure for success and failure provide a compass for everyone involved that answers the question: where are we now, and where are we heading? Such a compass sets the stage for your team to act independently and effectively toward a common goal. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Eight: Set up reliable, honest, and concise reporting on current and look-ahead progress, and watch it carefully. </strong> <br/> <br/> A clear progress report requires three elements: reliability, honesty, and brevity. Low reliability of information causes issues. Incomplete or anecdotal information leads to bad decisions. Too much information creates an inability to focus on what&rsquo;s important. Careful and ongoing attention to each of these elements greatly increases the likelihood of success. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Nine: Establish clear consequences linked to the success or failure of milestones and outcomes. </strong> <br/> <br/> The consequences related to interim milestones and final outcomes are often glossed over or ill-defined. Set milestones that - if missed - could threaten the overall effort, and link them to predefined consequences. In this way, success and failure will be clear to everyone, and no one can be surprised when consequences - either positive or negative -follow. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Factor Ten: Create a stream of continuous feedback that helps you detect and correct problems. </strong> <br/> <br/> Outcome is a result of people, resources, and process. Great processes are designed to self-educate &ndash; that is, they are designed to identify and correct errors in a timely way. Building in real-time error-detection and correction feedback mechanisms will improve the quality of intended outcomes continuously.

{"original_id":2726,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Ten Years And One Day: Why Ben Affleck And Jennifer Garner May Have Waited To Split","link":"ten-years-and-one-day-why-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garner-may-have-waited-to-split","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Celebrity divorces make headlines much more often than they make any real difference in the lives of ordinary folks like you and me. Occasionally, though, an interesting angle to a high-profile case gives all divorcing women something useful to think about. One recent example: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, celebrated movie star couple and parents of three children, have decided to call it quits. Their announcement was reportedly made one day after their tenth wedding anniversary. Why is that significant? <strong>  Is there something special about a marriage that lasts ten years plus one day? </strong></p><p> Every breakup involves a variety of different issues, and I don&rsquo;t have any inside information about what happened between Affleck and Garner. However, I can envision several possible rationales behind their timing. For example, when you think about it in psychological terms, ten years is a nice round number. A decade represents a good chapter of our lives, and for many, it makes emotional sense to begin the next chapter with an announcement of the previous chapter&rsquo;s conclusion. It&rsquo;s also often true that when a couple shares publicly that their marriage is ending, the wrenching emotional work of breaking up is largely behind them. By the time the news gets beyond closest friends and family, they are through agonizing over whether splitting up is the right thing to do. In short, a couple might be essentially done with thinking emotionally; now, they&rsquo;re ready to think financially.</p><p> On that note, here are some of the financial considerations that come into play, regarding the timing of the Affleck/Garner split:</p><h3> Establishing a Date of Separation</h3><p> <br/> Whatever else a divorce represents &ndash; the end of a once-loving relationship, a new parenting arrangement, the beginning of separate lives &ndash; legally speaking, divorce is about  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2011/04/12/understanding-how-assets-get-divided-in-divorce/\" target=\"_blank\">  division of assets </a>  and debts. To determine various property interests and establish a valuation date for certain assets, the courts designate a formal  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2011/09/28/why-divorcing-women-need-to-pay-careful-attention-to-the-date-of-separation/\" target=\"_blank\">  Date of Separation </a>  (DOS).</p><p> In some cases (especially if the parties disagree), nailing down a DOS can be tricky. By making a formal, joint announcement of their intention to divorce, Affleck and Garner have streamlined that whole process, taking any uncertainty out of the picture, and reinforcing their stated desire for a cooperative, amicable split.</p><p> So, why do it one day after their tenth anniversary?</p><h3> Allowing for More Spousal Support</h3><p> <br/> In California, where the Affleck/Garner divorce will be adjudicated, marriages of ten or more years are deemed &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; marriages. That has implications for the amount and duration of spousal support that can be ordered by the court. After a long-term marriage, the court retains jurisdiction over such decisions, and a judge can award the lesser earning spouse alimony of greater amount and/or duration than if the marriage had lasted less than ten years.</p><h3> Ensuring Eligibility for Social Security and Military Benefits</h3><p> <br/> If a marriage passes the ten year mark, the lesser earning spouse (still, most often, the wife) can receive Social Security benefits based on the other spouse&rsquo;s earning record, when she reaches an eligible age. She is not eligible for this benefit if her marriage lasted less than ten years.</p><p> The same is true of certain military benefits. Ten years of marriage, it appears, signifies to the government a degree of seriousness sufficient to warrant federal benefits for the lesser earning spouse.</p><h3> Meeting Time-Sensitive Provisions of a Prenuptial Agreement</h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t know if Affleck and Garner have  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/10/16/how-key-portions-of-prenups-and-postnups-can-be-invalidated/\" target=\"_blank\">   a prenuptial agreement  </a> </u>  in place, or if so, what it says. If they did have a prenup, it&rsquo;s possible that the agreement specified different terms after ten years of marriage. Several such provisions might have influenced the timing of the announcement of their decision to divorce.</p><p> For instance, some couples include a clause in their prenups dictating that after a certain number of years of marriage, an additional financial benefit is to be paid to the dependent spouse if they divorce. Some agreements specify an actual sum that the lower earning spouse is to receive for each year of the marriage; the amount may increase with each passing year. The amount itself, of course, depends on the earnings and assets of the wealthier spouse.</p><p> Many prenups contain something called a &ldquo;sunset provision,&rdquo; stating that after x years of marriage, the entire prenup, or certain of its provisions, becomes null and void. If Affleck and Garner have such an agreement and wanted certain provisions to lapse, that could explain their decision to delay their formal split until after ten years had passed.</p><p> Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, as an exceptionally high-earning couple, were probably not primarily concerned with some of these factors. Still, they are important for most divorcing women to consider. Financially speaking (all else being equal), waiting to end a marriage until after its tenth year can be a good move.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/p70-97.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Census data  </a> </u>  show that in the U.S., the average duration of first marriages that end in divorce is eight years. If you&rsquo;ve been married almost a decade and the relationship is beginning to unravel, there might be sensible reasons to take a cue from the Affleck/Garner case and stick it out for ten years and a day. When it comes time to collect Social Security, you might be glad you did.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-15 19:47:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-15 19:47:31.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_gUTJIpu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ten-years-and-one-day-why-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garner-may-have-waited-to-split/\", \"post_id\": \"6112\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-15 19:47:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-15 19:47:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ten-years-and-one-day-why-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garner-may-have-waited-to-split\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6111\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2799\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-12.48.02-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1153\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442419200,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2727,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Straight Talk about Volatility and Compound Interest – the Snowball Effect","link":"straight-talk-about-volatility-and-compound-interest-the-snowball-effect","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Compound interest is, simply put, the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment has already earned.</p><p> Why is it important? Because your two potential advantages when it comes to maximizing potential earnings over time are:</p><li> The power of compound interest</li><li> Investing regularly through market highs and lows <br/>  </li><p> Let&rsquo;s break this dynamic duo down:</p><h3> The Power of Compounding</h3><p> <br/> Compound interest is often compared to a snowball. If a 2-inch snowball starts rolling, it picks up more snow, enough to cover its tiny circumference. As it keeps rolling, its surface grows, so it picks up more snow with each revolution.</p><p> If you invest $1000 in a fund that pays 8% annual interest compounded yearly, in 10 years you&rsquo;ll have $2158.93, in 20 years that will be $4660.96, in 30 years it will be $10,062.66, and in 40 years it will be $21,724.52. All it takes is patience to turn $1000 &ndash; the price of one ski weekend &ndash; into $21,724.52.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to start saving early.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"chart25\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chart25-1024x786.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> The above chart is hypothetical and assumes an 8% rate of return compounded annually. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any specific investment.   Investment return and principal values will fluctuate so that your investment when redeemed may be worth more or less than its original cost. Rates of return do not include fees and charges, which are inherent to other investment products. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.</p><h3> Volatility &ndash; Market Highs and Lows</h3><p> <br/> But what happens if the market dips and your investment loses value?</p><p> Volatility &ndash; when market value fluctuates up and down &ndash; can be an opportunity for disciplined savers who contribute regularly to their investments, regardless of share price. When prices are low, you&rsquo;re able to buy more shares. When prices are high you&rsquo;re able to buy fewer shares for the same amount but those shares earn more interest, which is called Dollar Cost Averaging (Dollar cost averaging does not protect against a loss in declining markets. Since such a plan involves continuous investments in securities regardless of the fluctuating price levels, the investor should consider his or her financial ability to continue such purchases through period of low price levels.)</p><p> Imagine that snowball again, rolling down a hill, acquiring more and more snow as it goes. What happens when it hits a bare patch with no snow? Often it picks up rocks and pebbles, which add even more surface volume. So, when it hits the snow again, it picks up even more because it&rsquo;s larger.</p><p> That&rsquo;s how compound interest, coupled with regular investments, may work too: the &ldquo;rough patches&rdquo; produce more volume, which then allows you to acquire more compounded interest. So if you buy more shares during a dip, when the market recovers you could hypothetically not only earn compound interest on more shares, you earn more interest. So long as the price of your particular investment recovers, of course.</p><p> As Josh Brown points out in his recent blog post about Warren Buffett and David Tepper, both these legendary investors have gotten to where they are today because they&rsquo;ve successfully ridden out volatility. In 1998 Warren Buffets own Berkshire Hathaway&rsquo;s &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares had dropped in price from approximately $80,000 to $59,000 but Buffet didn&rsquo;t sell. Those shares just hit a high of $229,000 this year.</p><p> <strong>  If you see volatility &ndash; like what we experienced in August &ndash; as a tool and keep contributing regularly to your investments, you&rsquo;ll potentially maximize the effect of compounded interest and watch your investments snowball over time! </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-15 19:55:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-15 19:55:19.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_WevuDcI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/straight-talk-about-volatility-and-compound-interest-the-snowball-effect/\", \"post_id\": \"6114\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-15 19:55:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-15 19:55:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"straight-talk-about-volatility-and-compound-interest-the-snowball-effect\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6113\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2800\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Snowball-Compounding-Interest3-752x480.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1587\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442408400,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

What is a good client? This ideal client varies for different people, but I think there are some important characteristics that are nearly universal. Here are 9 of them.</p><h3> Good clients:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Are capable, motivated, and ambitious.  </strong> Whether they are a manager or a CEO, they want to improve their business, shake things up, and take them to the next level. Machiavelli wrote in The Prince, &ldquo;A prince who is not himself wise can never be well advised.\"</p><p> <strong>  Are confident.  </strong> They are comfortable in their own skin and secure in their abilities. They are not threatened by having smart advisors around them. On the contrary, they welcome working with other talented people.</p><p> <strong>  Have the confidence of their leadership. </strong> If their own company doesn&rsquo;t think they are competent, your work may end up in the trash after a perfunctory review.</p><p> <strong>  Are in a position to do something in their organizations. </strong>  If your client can&rsquo;t make decisions and has no authority to act, you&rsquo;ll be endlessly frustrated.</p><p> <strong>  Have a bias for action but also a long-term orientation. </strong> They want to get things done&mdash;now&mdash;but realize they must apply steady pressure to their organizations and to the problems they are facing in order to get results that endure.</p><p> <strong>  Find value in long-term relationships. </strong>  Usually you know this because they have a history of building trusted relationships with external service providers and also with their key constituencies internally.</p><p> <strong>  Are loyal and willing to give others credit. </strong>  If you deliver for them consistently and do a good job, they want to tell others about you and recommend you to their colleagues and friends. They aren&rsquo;t afraid to introduce you to their boss and to other executives in their company.</p><p> <strong>  Treat you with respect from the get-go.  </strong> If a top client executive gets on the phone and immediately is respectful of me and of my experiences, I almost always find that they remain that way as the relationship develops. But clients who treat me like a vendor in the first conversation often keep that attitude throughout the engagement.</p><p> <strong>  Are a good strategic fit for your offering and your firm. </strong>  Everyone's criteria for this will be a bit different&ndash;a company that is too small for one provider may be too large for another! What is it for you? What types of clients are a good fit for your services and business model? </p><h3> Correspondingly, when these qualities are lacking, it&rsquo;s bad news.</h3><p> <br/> Avoid clients who are insecure, are poor performers, lack authority, are all talk but no action, don&rsquo;t value relationships, and only begrudgingly give others credit!</p><p> How do you act on this?

The most prestigious and glamorous sailing event in the world.</strong>It brings those passionate about sailing and the sea together with big business and serious advertising.At the last America&rsquo;s Cup, the contest was particularly exciting. The match was the longest on record both in calendar time, and the number of races, with the U.S.&rsquo;s Golden Gate Yacht Club staging an improbable come-from-behind victory, winning eight races in a row to defend the Cup with nine points to New Zealand&rsquo;s eight.With all of the media coverage and big name sponsors associated with the Cup (Louis Vuitton, BMW, Oracle, etc.) the event is a showcase for our oceans.The excitement about the 35th Cup, being held in Bermuda, is unprecedented and with this they have the opportunity to remind us all about the importance of protecting the sea and helping to clean up oceans.<h3> Unfortunately, the America&rsquo;s Cup is not off to a good start.</h3>After achieving the highest honor possible during the 34th Cup for implementing environmental sustainability best practices, it is surprising that the organizers of the 35th Cup created potential harm to the ocean by <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1175348529158245&amp;id=119505771409198&amp;refid=17&amp;_ft_=top_level_post_id.1175348529158245\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> releasing balloons</a> in Gothenburg.

Benet   </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Socialancer   </u> </a> Would you like to know the real secret of growth hacking and what you should do to use it in your business?In this post we will summarize the five key issues you should ask yourself when you want your business to grow exponentially .This is a summary of the workshop in which we accompany  <u>  <a href=\"http://fullstackmarketer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Casey Armstrong  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://vlaskovits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Patrick Vlaskovits  </a> </u> , two of the leaders in growth hacking in the United States last June 6 in Madrid. <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Growth-Hacking-Madrid-02.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Growth Hacking Madrid 02\" src=\"http://www.socialancer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Growth-Hacking-Madrid-02-e1434057487768.jpg\"/> </a> What you will understand through all the points, but at the end of the post I will explain where the real secret.I leave the 5 key .</p><h3> # 1. The medium is the message. Innova in the middle</h3>One of the major problems when it comes to innovation is that usually stay in the \"traditional innovation\", ie, that part of our own context. However, to think beyond is necessary to seek ways of disruptive innovation.This article Enrique Dans explained very well the difference between the two types of innovation: <u> <a href=\"http://www.enriquedans.com/2013/11/innovacion-incremental-versus-radical-te-gusta-conducir.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  incremental versus radical innovation: do you like to drive? </a></u>Summarize the fundamentals to explain these two ideas. In the automotive sector is very clearly the difference from the first vehicle created has innovated a lot, but the cars still in its conception, the same, that is, are conducted with the steering wheel, with the driver sitting in a seat and powered combustion engine. It has been innovated, therefore, within the same idea or concept.A disruptive innovation is the case of <u> Toyota FV2</u>, driving a car without a steering wheel and body movements.This book image Patrick quote below summarizes very well the difference between traditional and disruptive innovation: <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/innovation-spectrum-2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Print\" src=\"http://www.socialancer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/innovation-spectrum-2.jpg\"/></a>While in traditional innovation well understand what we face in disruptive innovation we enter a new market in which innovation changes the rules , the market is unpredictable and not traditional methods work .That is, if you want to change the way you innovate in your business, you must think in an original way ( out of the box ) and open-minded enough to take very different from those to which we are accustomed rules.<h3> How to innovate in the middle</h3>One way to achieve this is to realize that the medium is the message .An example: in the 70s are used to sell music through concerts. At that time the band \"The Eagles\" decided to create music \"sound good in the car\", knowing that many people would consume his songs on cassette and in that space (middle).So much so that they had their own car for testing.In the 80s they have to change again, as the average at that time began to be audiovisual due to MTV.Adapt your content to a medium other than usual will allow you to grow exponentially because you can present your proposal in the context of \"surprising\" and surely appeal to a good portion of your public use.<h3> # 2. Apply the 6 Principles of Influence your communication</h3>Another aspect to keep in mind when communicate are the six principles of influence of Robert Cialdini . That is, what will make people believe that your content or product worth can be summarized in 6 points.I explain this with the example of online content you can offer in a blog:<li> Principle of Reciprocity . If you offer your users valuable content, people will want to \"return the favor\" and be more receptive when you offer a payment product, for example.</li><li> Principle Commitment and Constancia . In the case of a blog, publish regularly and not leave. It is a way that your audience know that you are going to deliver content consistently and want to come back to you.</li><li> Principle of social proof . Social buttons. When many people share a content, that is proof that produces interest.</li><li> Principle of Authority . Demonstrate your content that you know what you're talking about. The content should always be quality.</li><li> Sympathy principle . It is easier to let ourselves be influenced by the people we like it not for one that does not attract us.</li><li> Principle of Scarcity . When the buyer of a product knows that there are many units, it is more likely to feel the need to not miss this opportunity.</li>In this video you will understand better the first one, which no longer respond to cultural factors:<a href=\"https://youtu.be/YxWokYaJKYw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-2.33.07-PM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/></a><h3> # 3. Original Collaborations</h3>One way to go further is to collaborate or partner with other parties who may have a common interest , whether or not of your sector.In this case Patrick put a personal example: when he published his book <u> <a href=\"/category/grow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Lean Entrepreneur: How visionaries create new products, develop innovative projects and transform markets </a></u>, which ended up being bestseller in the New York Times, he proposed a collaboration with American Airlines.The proposal made ​​to them was to do a book tour in which American Airlines United States accompany around an author who was to become a celebrity in his field.Note that, in a normal context, an airline probably would not have raised the collaboration with the author of a book on a tour of a country. However, it is again an original proposal in which all earned: Patrick bulged free American Airlines flights while sending a message to a public interest they shared: support to entrepreneurs.<h3> # 4. SEO is everything</h3>It is not to do a full audit of all aspects of SEO you need your website, but what you can do is touch those who will help you optimize what you already have .In the case of a blog, for example, you can re-optimize content you already have posted in reformulating the following:<li> Title</li><li> Menus</li><li> URLs</li><li> Metadescriptions</li><li> Alternative text for images</li>They are obviously many possibilities offered by the SEO, but sometimes the simplest goes unnoticed.<h3> # 5. Marketing Pay</h3>Usually we talk about <u> <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/category/posicionamiento-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  natural position </a></u>, but often find the position from certain <u> <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/tag/curso-facebook-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  cash shares </a></u> may be a necessary strategy. It is not just about putting advertising to sell something, but to better position your own content and attract a site facing your target.Sometimes there are more opportunities in sectors that do not fully exploit. For example, AdWords provides to non-profit organizations the opportunity to receive up to $ 10,000 per month on advertising with <u> <a href=\"http://www.google.es/intl/es/grants/\" target=\"_blank\">  Google Grants </a></u>, something that certainly can enable them to reach a more targeted audience.<img alt=\"\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-2.36.26-PM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/><h3> The real secret of growth hacking</h3>The real secret? As Casey and Patrick told us: \"Testing, testing, testing\" .There are no magic formulas it out of your head. Or tactics that will make your business a quantum leap if they are not supported by a clear strategy (and based on a constant trial and error that must assume). Note that rather than tactics, in this post -in Workshop- we talked about strategy.Yes there are <u> <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/recursos/herramientas-marketing-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  tools that facilitate </a></u> the implementation of certain actions, but my advice is to choose the tool once you have clear strategy, not vice versa. We tend to look for tools that allow us to solve specific problems when, in fact, not clear whether these problems we need in our business.Now, although I would not say that \"anything goes\" sometimes the boundary between right and could not be considered right is more blurred in this field. And, they say, that's not necessarily bad.There is no web hack, but sometimes you can touch the limit. And that is something you will find only imagination and, above all, knowing full well your <u> <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/claves-modelo-negocio-para-marketers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  business </a></u> and your <u> <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/espiar-competencia-mejorar-estrategia-sin-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  competition </a></u>.What made ​​Airbnb and Casey Armstrong explained in this post (<u> <a href=\"http://www.socialancer.com/growth-hacking-airbnb-uber/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why Growth Hacking How Airbnb and Uber innovate Marketing and Product </a></u>) was a hack -rozando as \"unethical\" - based on a clear strategy: to reach a hearing at that time had no Airbnb from a bot that ran from Craigslist users to your own site. Was it right or ethical what they did? The debate is open, but in any case was a strategic and very smart move.

They could allow advisers to help more people, regardless of their financial stage in life.</p><h3> Exposing the gate-keeper&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> From inception, the financial services industry has told consumers they don&rsquo;t have the skill or ability to manage their own affairs so there&rsquo;s no use trying. Some financial planners became gatekeepers to wealth solutions, forcing consumers to go through them.</p><p> Thankfully, that self-interested Berlin Wall is slowly crumbling, as it should. In the process the &lsquo;gate-keepers&rsquo; nakedness is at last being exposed . Technology is shaking the industry from its complacency, challenging status quo, and I say &lsquo;bring it on&rsquo;.</p><p> More Australians should learn about wealth management, tax, behavioural finance, budgets and investing. However any business model that aims to become an alternative for professional financial advice, without the invisible hand, is flawed.</p><p> Only 20 per cent of Australians seek advice.</p><p> A new fintech claiming their financial tools and education will give a greater number of Australians more control over their money (which I assume is their intended meaning of democratising financial advice) is similar to saying the internet will give us more control.</p><p> Choice, yes, but control?</p><p> Robo-advice is misnamed at present as it lacks the invisible hand. It&rsquo;s not advice but better financial product selection and education.</p><p> In time, however, robo-advice will evolve with an invisible hand.</p><p> I predict that like the Wright brothers with only bicycle-making experience championing flight, the pioneers that crack robo-advice with an effective invisible hand will come from left-field, and I&rsquo;m guessing with strengths in the humanities, not the financials.</p><p> What do you reckon?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 13:46:37.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 13:46:37.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_HK1XdMs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-robo-advice-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"6124\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 13:46:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 13:46:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-robo-advice-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6123\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2805\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-16-at-11.30.46-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"625\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442487600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2732,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Ways to Know When To Call It Quits","link":"8-ways-to-know-when-to-call-it-quits","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Unfortunately, many relationships never get off the ground, because one or both parties have always had one foot out the door&mdash;never able to really commit and hoping (and looking) for something better to come around.</p><p> And then there are relationships on the brink, with just a little help and enhanced communication, can actually be saved, rehabilitated, and actually set up to thrive.</p><p> But, how many relationships just keep going and going, despite the clear warning signs that things just will not get better?</p><p> <strong>  Here are some very clear signs that, no matter how scary it may be, it is time to call it quits and move on. </strong></p><h3> 1. You have been physically abused</h3><p> Oftentimes, if you are the abused, you fall for the apologies afterwards and the promises that it will not happen again. The truth is, the fear of leaving and being out on your own in many ways trumps the fear of continued abuse, so you stay in the &ldquo;comfort zone&rdquo; of misery and despair.  Once you are physically abused it is time to cut the cord.</p><h3> 2. You are verbally abused</h3><p> Physical abuse usually doesn&rsquo;t happen on a daily basis, but verbal abuse does. And you may justify the abuse, by being happy you are not getting abused physically. Sometimes both come together, but many times not and the abuser doesn&rsquo;t see anything wrong. But the adage that &ldquo;sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can never hurt you&rdquo;, is the biggest falsehood. Words stick and the longer you remain in such a situation, the more you begin to believe them and the more impotent you will become.  </p><h3> 3. You are afraid of your partner</h3><p> Are you excited when your partner comes home? Or are you shaking in your boots, walking on egg shells, hoping you don&rsquo;t say anything that may upset him (or her)? What will the next barrage be? The next blowup? Will it leave you with a fat lip, bruised ribs, or an unrepairable self-esteem? You should never allow yourself to live in fear and when you find yourself living there, it&rsquo;s time to relocate.</p><h3> 4. Your partner blames you or others for their bad behavior and choices</h3><p> When 9/11 happened, the terrorists blamed the debauchery of the United States for their actions. At the time, I likened this to an abusive husband who might rationalize his actions by saying, for example, &ldquo;if only she would have my dinner waiting for me when I get home, then I wouldn&rsquo;t have slugged her!&rdquo; People who constantly blame you or others for their plight, refuse to accept personal responsibility, and act out with rage, are dangerous. Whether they are terrorists or your wife, makes no difference. If that is your relationship, then it&rsquo;s time to split.  </p><h3> 5. Your partner&rsquo;s behavior jeopardizes the safety of children</h3><p> This is nonnegotiable. When your children are in danger, it is your duty as an adult to protect them.</p><h3> 6. Your partner is dependent on someone else other than you</h3><p> For many years, in-law jokes have been choice fodder for comedians. Parents are often reluctant to let their children go, even when they are adults. A relationship in which one partner has a co-dependent relationship with their parent can be the seed to a toxic relationship&mdash;your relationship. Co-dependent is exactly what it states&mdash;each person is dependent on the other. You do not want your partner to be dependent on anyone, especially their parent who has their own agendas, usually not considering your needs and wants. The same goes for a &ldquo;best friend&rdquo;. If your partner is dependent on his or her best friend for decisions, look out!</p><h3> 7. Your partner is a serial liar, manipulator, and/or cheater</h3><p> The phrase, &ldquo;Once a cheat, always a cheat,&rdquo; may or may not be true. Same with liar or manipulator. But it tends to be true if it happens more than once. I do believe a relationship can survive an infidelity, but only if each partner is open and completely honest with each other&hellip;and themselves. This will take a lot of work, most likely including relationship counseling.  If you do not think you can handle that, then it is likely to eat at you for the rest of your days in the relationship.  </p><h3> 8. You feel the need to change your partner</h3><p> The only person who can change your partner is your partner. If you do not love him or her for who they are, then they are not for you. It is important to understand just what it is that caused you to fall in love in the first place.  Was it that you felt protected, rescued from your insecurity? Was it purely sexual chemistry? Connection that brings us together, based purely on our automatic (primitive and animalistic) brain, is never long lasting. When the foundation of a relationship rests squarely on this, it is fragile. Unless you or your partner are aware that you need to take it to another level, nothing will change.   But that change must be self-induced.</p><p> I am fortunate to be married for over 25-years. During this time, I have seen many of my family and friends&rsquo; relationships end. Some of them could have been salvaged with a little work, but the others should have ended a long time ago. Life is short and we can&rsquo;t take back the past. That&rsquo;s why it is important to assess your current situation and decide whether it is time for you to begin living again.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 14:49:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 14:49:52.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_k65LsD0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-ways-to-know-when-to-call-it-quits/\", \"post_id\": \"6126\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 14:49:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 14:49:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-ways-to-know-when-to-call-it-quits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6125\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2806\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442366783285-838b5f033cc8-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"682\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442502000,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

As someone who spends much of his awake time (and a fair bit of sleep time) thinking about techniques to accomplish more, I recently found myself thinking about slowing down.</p><p> Between the contraptions, devices, apps (on my!), friends, relatives, bosses, customers, and anything else with two or four, we move from rise time until pillow time. It&rsquo;s astonishing we haven&rsquo;t somehow re-calibrated space and time to lengthen what we consider &ldquo;a day.&rdquo;</p><p> Since that&rsquo;s unlikely to happen anytime soon, I thought I&rsquo;d offer up twenty-one of my tricks to slow down your day.</p><p> I wanted to be Speed Racer growing up. I sometimes still do&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Do things slower. </strong> Duh. Wake up slower. Get out of bed slower. Shower slower. Eat slower. Drive slower. Pet your dog slower. It works. I even typed that sentence slower to test my theory. That&rsquo;s one for the plus column.</p><p> Where&rsquo;s Olivia Newton-John when you need her?</p><p> <strong>  Exercise. </strong> As in get your heart rate elevated. Do it whenever you can schedule it in-morning, lunchtime, nighttime. Anytime is better than no time, but morning time is un-steal-able if you can fit it in. It&rsquo;ll make everything else seem like it&rsquo;s moving slower&hellip;even your heart rate when you&rsquo;re done.</p><p> Is it a Leap Year yet? I could use the extra time&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Schedule less. </strong> Super Duh. Schedule fewer things throughout the day because something unexpected will undoubtedly come up. If nothing does, you can use the unscheduled time to be more productive. When your schedule is full, you have no time to handle the unexpected so you toss it at the end of the day (if you didn&rsquo;t already slide everything else later). Your day just got longer. Congratulations.</p><p> <strong>  Schedule, uh, nothing. </strong>  If you just can&rsquo;t help your I-need-to-fill-my-calendar compulsive self, then insert a few blackouts. That way you have a little cushion for the unexpected.</p><p> <strong>  Schedule email. </strong> For most, this is not only the biggest distraction, but also can send your schedule unnecessarily off course as you attend to what you think is urgent. Try checking your email when you arrive at work, when you return from lunch, and before you leave work. If you&rsquo;re an incessant type, try doing it once each hour instead of sixty times each hour. If you must check your email because it&rsquo;s a job requirement, try to limit it to opening only those that possibly require urgent care.</p><p> &ldquo;Sit up straight&rdquo; was darn good advice. Thanks Mom.</p><p> <strong>  Sit correctly. </strong> As in anatomically correctly the way your spine was meant to fluctuate. Sitting correctly at your desk or wherever you sit is important. Hunching over makes you feel more tight and stressed. If you stand for work, stand correctly.</p><p> <strong>  Stand up periodically. </strong> Assuming many of us sit most of the time at work, make sure to take a break and stand. Walk for a few minutes to wake up your butt.</p><p> <strong>  Stretch. </strong> See previous only be more aggressive.</p><p> What time is it? It&rsquo;s now silly.</p><p> <strong>  Stay present. </strong> Attempt to stay in the present moment for one hour. I bet you can&rsquo;t do it. Try it anyway. It&rsquo;s a fact that 12% of human thought is about the future. That&rsquo;s two of your awake hours every single day. Do you realize that in an entire year you spend 730 hours thinking about stuff that will likely never happen? Moving right along&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Breathe. </strong> One great way to stay present is to breathe deeply. Try this. Breathe in through your nose so that your belly expands. While it&rsquo;s expanding, breathe in through your mouth so your chest also expands. Repeat five times. There. All better.</p><p> <strong>  Notice. </strong> Pay attention to the little things. Pay attention to the unexciting things. The more you focus on them the more exciting they become.</p><p> <strong>  Stay grounded. </strong> This is part of the graduate program of the Stay Present curriculum. If you can stay grounded and not lose your mind for the moment, you&rsquo;ll likely remain present. It&rsquo;s a transitive property thing.</p><p> I thought it was impolite to stare.</p><p> <strong>  Focus on people. </strong> It&rsquo;s one thing to stay present and another to stay grounded, but it&rsquo;s quite special to truly focus on people. Some jobs require more human interaction than others, but take what you can get. Any chance you&rsquo;re able to engage with another, make an extra effort to soak in all of him or her. You will find that what you think about you bring about. Think about their great qualities. Imagine their journey. Learn from them. You&rsquo;ll be amazed in more ways than one.</p><p> <strong>  Coffee! </strong> Who doesn&rsquo;t love coffee? If you&rsquo;re not a coffee drinker, have tea or whatever you drink. Take a break. Better yet, take a break with some other people.</p><p> It&rsquo;s been two minutes since I last checked. Omigawd. I wonder what I missed on Facebook.</p><p> <strong>  Become Anti-Social. </strong> As in Media. I love social media! Just take a break every now and then.</p><p> Lost&mdash;Have you seen my cell phone?</p><p> <strong>  Unplug. </strong> That means no electronics. Not even a hairdryer.</p><p> Found&mdash;I knew I should have looked there first!</p><p> <strong>  Find joy. </strong> Look for the joy in everything you get to do. You&rsquo;ll never find it if you don&rsquo;t look for it. It&rsquo;s a fact that joy exists in virtually anything you can imagine. You just need to look closely enough.</p><p> But I&rsquo;m supposedly a grown up&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Play. </strong> I don&rsquo;t care what it is&mdash;video games, rugby, checkers, or chess. I stopped right after I typed the lead in to this section to play hide and seek with my dogs. I wanted to make sure I ate my own dog food so to speak. Huge pun intended. They found me every time. Suspense over.</p><p> <strong>  Goof off. </strong> You have no idea how hard we laughed after we took this picture. I still laugh just as hard as I did two days ago when it was taken. This little one is a gift that keeps on giving.</p><p> Who doesn&rsquo;t love a list?</p><p> <strong>  Write down three things. </strong> The reason many organized people have trouble executing a productive day is because they have too many items on their to-do lists. I accomplish a ton and I never have more than three major items that have to be accomplished on a given day. If you can focus on the truly important acts, you&rsquo;ll be amazed at how much extra credit you can earn in a day.</p><p> Can you just give me the CliffsNotes?</p><p> <strong>  No. </strong> Well, yes. Just say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I probably could have saved the first thousand words I wrote and just given you these few. It&rsquo;s the silver bullet. If you can simply and tactfully say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the many requests you receive throughout the day, you&rsquo;ll be cured. This becomes much easier to do when you focus on only those things that are truly important to you.</p><p> I&rsquo;d love to hear from you: Any tips to slow down the day?</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 18:08:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 18:08:27.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Ze7nUIC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/21-not-so-secret-ways-to-slow-down-your-day/\", \"post_id\": \"6128\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 18:08:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 18:08:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"21-not-so-secret-ways-to-slow-down-your-day\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6127\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2807\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1441716844725-09cedc13a4e7.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"404\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442505600,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2734,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Give ‘em Something To Talk About!","link":"give-em-something-to-talk-about","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Popular advice says that you should create client experiences to get ahead in business. I agree with that, but I do think there is something even more important. The real differentiator comes when you give clients a  <strong>  memorable </strong>  experience.</p><p> What kind of experience is your firm giving to your clients? If you suspect that your clients are not talking about you, it may be time to make a change. To borrow a phrase from singer and songwriter, Bonnie Raitt, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give &lsquo;em something to talk about.&rdquo; Because if we don&rsquo;t give them something to talk about, it is highly likely they will never say anything at all.</p><p> When clients want to talk about the experiences they have with your business (assuming it&rsquo;s positive talk, of course), it means you&rsquo;re doing something really right. And it means they&rsquo;re much more likely to refer their friends and colleagues to you.</p><p> So, consider making a list of the possible &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; you could offer your clients. You may want to brainstorm ideas with your colleagues. It could be a small gift you give to a client after every meeting (like a book or candy), a proactive phone call, or a holiday surprise that you personally deliver. However, most often I see the memorable experiences consisting of extraordinary service. And, this service is extraordinary because it was delivered with consistency and passion.  <strong>  Does your team deliver service with consistency and passion? </strong>  It may be the greatest way to give someone something unexpected to remember and talk about.</p><p> Keep in mind that &lsquo;giving them something to talk about&rsquo; is serious business, but is best delivered while authentically enjoying your job and having some fun along the way.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 18:30:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 18:30:46.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_3W3lFvU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/give-em-something-to-talk-about/\", \"post_id\": \"6130\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 18:30:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 18:30:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"give-em-something-to-talk-about\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6129\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2808\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-16-at-11.31.21-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"480\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442494800,"author_id":322,"chart_url":""}

And the bigger question: do you actually have to choose? </strong></p><p> When you think \"servant leader,\" who comes to mind? </p><p> How about \"goal-driven leader\"? </p><p> Which would you rather be - service-hearted or goal-driven?</p><h3> And the bigger question: Can you be both?</h3><p> <br/> I completely, whole-heartedly believe so. You can set goals - even revenue goals - with a service-based heart. And when you can fully live and work in both, as most of my coaching clients do or strive to do, that's the sweetest spot. </p><p> I will declare this until the end: You can make a difference and make a living. In this situation, you do not have to choose.</p><p> That being said, there is a difference between inspired action and frenetic activity. My clients aim for bold goals but with meaning and purpose - not just busy-ness. Here are 5 key habits I've discovered among meaningful achievers that you can assess and incorporate in your work and life:</p><h3> 1. They decide, proactively, what matters most.</h3><p> You can't do everything all at once. (Trust me, I've learned the hard way!) Meaningful achievers choose what matters most, then invest time, energy, and resources selectively.</p><h3> 2. They focus on inspired action rather than \"busy-ness.\"</h3><p> If you ask someone, \"How are you?\" and they respond, \"Busy!\", are you impressed? Me neither. I am a rapt audience, however, when someone shares the energizing, purposeful actions he's taking to grow, change, or serve. </p><h3> 3. They create goals in alignment with their values.</h3><p> Depending on your values, a revenue goal in and of itself might not be motivating. But how about a revenue goal with the desire to take your family on vacation, contribute significantly to a nonprofit, and support three community programs this year? Meaningful achievers know their core values and live and work in accordance with them. </p><h3> 4. They designate time to plan, reflect, and think.</h3><p> When talking about preparing for battle, Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, \"I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.\" Even if you don't follow your plans to the letter, the act of creating them will help you achieve with meaning and purpose.</p><h3> 5. They live and work within the ripple.</h3><p> When you pursue your passion, serve with joy, and strive for meaningful goals, you set off a positive ripple effect that, far-fetched as it may sound, can change the world. Meaningful achievers get this. They also recognize that being part of the ripple means asking for help, hiring support, and reaching out. No need to go it alone!</p><p> Which of these habits do you practice? </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 18:39:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 18:39:49.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_zHO6UGf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-habits-of-meaningful-achievers/\", \"post_id\": \"6132\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 18:39:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 18:39:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-habits-of-meaningful-achievers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6131\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2809\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-16-at-11.48.02-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1116\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442509200,"author_id":150,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2736,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do You Project Confidence When Seated?","link":"do-you-project-confidence-when-seated","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Consider the posture of these participants in several of my recent seminars:</p><p> &bull; The woman who did not raise the seat of her chair and, as a result, sat significantly lower than the individuals on either side of her. It looked like her older siblings had brought her to the meeting.</p><p> &bull; The manager who crossed her arms and perched her reading glasses on the tip of her nose. She gave the appearance of looking down at others in the meeting.</p><p> &bull; The boss who leaned way back in his chair and seemed to be sleeping. His employees thought he wasn&rsquo;t interested in their input.</p><p> Your posture when you are seated at a meeting sends a message about you. You want that message to be professional. Here are some suggestions for ensuring that your seated posture conveys confidence &ndash; whether you are one of 20 sitting around a large table, or meeting one-on-one with your boss.</p><p> <strong>  1. Stay still. </strong>  Don&rsquo;t swivel in your chair or tap your foot. Such actions become a distraction to others, and can give them the impression that you are nervous. Also, don&rsquo;t lean back and balance on just two legs of the chair. Not only does this convey the impression that you are uninterested or bored, it is potentially dangerous. If the chair tipped over, causing you to fall, you would certainly look foolish, and you might even be injured.</p><p> <strong>  2. Adjust seat levels. </strong>  You want to be on the same level as the other members of the group. If this means your feet don&rsquo;t touch the ground, raise the chair seat as high as you comfortably can, or rest your feet on something, such as a large dictionary or a short stool. My office manager, Joyce Hoff, is 4-feet-11 and I am 5-feet-8. We always adjust our chairs when we confer at the same table.</p><p> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t slump or look sloppy. </strong>  Sit up tall, and leave a little space between your lower back and the back of the chair. Of course, you may lean back slightly in your chair at times. Avoid folding your hands on the table (you are not in school), or crossing your arms (you appear defensive). Spread out, but don&rsquo;t encroach on someone else&rsquo;s space. In her book, Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg referenced a posture study in the professional journal Psychological Science:</p><p> --&ldquo;When people assumed a high-power pose (for example, taking up space by spreading their limbs) for just two minutes, their dominance hormone levels (testosterone) went up and their stress hormone levels (cortisol) went down. As a result, they felt more powerful and in charge and showed a greater tolerance for risk. A simple change in posture led to a significant change in attitude.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  4. Pay attention to your lower half. </strong>  Depending on the type of table at which you are seated, your legs may be visible to others. Keep both feet on the floor, although you may cross your ankles. Try not to cross your legs &ndash; it&rsquo;s bad for your circulation, among other things. (More information on crossing your legs can be found in Chapter 23 &ndash; &ldquo;If Crossing Your Legs Turns Women into Ladies, What Does It Do to Matt Lauer?&rdquo; &ndash; in my book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pachter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Essentials of Business Etiquette: How to Greet, Eat, and Tweet Your Way to Success  </a> </u> .)</p><p> Also pay attention to your clothing. One man wore black slacks, black shoes and white socks, which everyone noticed when he crossed one knee over the other. And be aware that if you are wearing a short skirt, it will hike up and expose a lot of your legs when you are seated.</p><p> <strong>  5. Make sure you take a seat at the table. </strong>  Do not sit on one of those chairs that are often arranged against the wall. You want to be part of the discussion, not an observer.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 18:40:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 18:40:05.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_UDWasdt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-project-confidence-when-seated/\", \"post_id\": \"6134\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 18:40:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 18:40:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-project-confidence-when-seated\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6133\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2810\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/people-woman-girl-writing-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"414\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442512800,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}

I actually had to sit on this for a few days and I find I&rsquo;m still shaking my head. The daily content shared by The Muse is quite good so this one perplexed me for so long that I&rsquo;m coming to my followers to see what you think.</p><p> The premise of the information is to help those who are not outwardly confident. It would be remiss of me to say this is an article for introverts because I know quite a few of those who have the confidence for certain situations when they are warranted.  It&rsquo;s aimed at those who struggle with confidence, &ldquo;&hellip; in unfamiliar situations or with unfamiliar people.&rdquo;.  The overall feel of this content, to tell someone to  &ldquo;Fake it &rsquo;til you make it&rdquo;  left me feeling dirty. Yuck!</p><p> We are surrounded by messages all the time to be yourself.  How about Oscar Wilde reminding you to: Be yourself, everyone else is taken.  I don&rsquo;t see anywhere in that message to be kind of like everyone else or to fake it &rsquo;til you make it, right?</p><p> Jim Morrison, the American songwriter, said to have total freedom in friendship, you must be yourself. I don&rsquo;t see any messages here about staying still, keeping your hands visible and making eye contact like the article says.  That sounds more like instructions for someone who is about to be arrested than someone applying for a job!</p><p> Paulo Coelho, one of my  <strong>  favorite </strong>  authors, shared the secret to success was to never lie to yourself.  Guess what? Pretending to be someone that you are not is lying to yourself.</p><p> We all have a tribe we subscribe to; a community where we belong.  If you&rsquo;re trying to appear to be one way and in reality you are not, there is going to come a time where someone will flush out your inner pheasant and discover the real you.  So why not make that where you begin instead?</p><p> I was recently at a content marketing conference in Cleveland, Ohio where the overarching message was about authenticity and courage.  I think that&rsquo;s <strong>  what&rsquo;s </strong>  really important here.  If you own who you are and have the courage to show that side of you to others, guess what?  You&rsquo;re going to be happiest in your own element and the person you are sharing the real you with will appreciate that side far more.</p><p> We each have a talent, a treasure, that is uniquely ours.  Please  <strong>  don&rsquo;t </strong>  fake it &rsquo;til you make it.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I still believe the everyday content at The Muse is quite good and encourage that you sign up for their newsletter  </a> </u> , but whether it&rsquo;s this article or any others telling you to be someone that you are not question if that is what you are really seeking.

{"original_id":2739,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Military Families Should Reconsider Using 529 College Savings Plans","link":"why-military-families-should-reconsider-using-529-college-savings-plans","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The 529 College Saving Plan is often one of the most common tools talked about in the world of financial planning.  Think about it, what&rsquo;s more important than taking care of your beloved little ones and ensuring they are set up for success in life. Well&hellip; I&rsquo;d often say taking care of yourself financially first so that they don&rsquo;t have to take care of YOU later in life, might be a slightly more important priority, sometimes we just need to have the peace of mind that college is going to be taken care of.</p><p> In comes the easiest sale in the world of financial planning for financial advisers and institutions.  The 529 plan.  It offers tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals for all qualified college expenses! Truly, this is great and if you already have one, be happy about it.  There are plenty of ways we can make this an effective tool for you later in life.</p><p> However, when we are thinking more specifically about our military community, do the majority of parents really need to get a 529 as the first option for college savings?  There are lots of ways to save for college that will give you the exact same benefits as a 529 without any lack of flexibility to your greater financial goals.  Lets take a look at a few of the downsides one should consider before entering into a 529 plan.</p><h3> 529&rsquo;s are better suited as an Estate Planning tool.</h3><p> <br/> &ndash; Unlike an IRA with small yearly minimums for a retirement plan, 529&rsquo;s can take much larger contributions without being subject to the Gift Tax.  So, are young parents going to be making these larger contributions, most likely not.  Usually, they&rsquo;ll be making $100-$500 monthly contributions depending on their budget.  Then who on earth do these gifts benefit?  Grandparents!  529&rsquo;s are great if Granny has a bunch of money she wants pass to her grandchildren for college, but not ideal for parents to do a monthly allotment.  Our military members are often focused on sending their children to college.  A noble goal, but that $100-$500 often should be directed elsewhere.</p><h3> 529&rsquo;s can count against Financial Aid.</h3><p> <br/> &ndash; Qualifying for financial aid is determined by a number of factors.  Income is one, but 529&rsquo;s are also sources of available assets.  Parents have to list most of their financial investments on the FAFSA form, regardless of whether or not those assets are meant to pay for college.  So they certainly have to report 529&rsquo;s.  Sounds like a double edged sword to me; a vehicle meant to help with college ends up hurting a middle class family&rsquo;s ability to qualify for the aid that is readily available.  Most military income levels put them at a level to qualify, and most military assets are in retirement funds that need not be reported on the FAFSA form.</p><h3> Most military qualify for the post 9/11 GI Bill.</h3><p> <br/> ​- When used properly, parents can significantly leverage this amazing benefit.  ​Not that they shouldn&rsquo;t have assets available for college in a multiple child scenario.  However, there are better places to save that money for college that will give parents similar tax benefits while also allowing more flexibility for using the funds rather than only for educational costs.  They would have the freedom to use the money for retirement, if it ended up not being needed for college.  529&rsquo;s get taxed and penalized on gains if not used for qualified college expenses.  If possible, Military should leverage the Post 9/11 GI Bill and focus more on saving for their own retirement rather than the assumption that their children will need it for college or even attend college at all.</p><h3> What happens if your children don&rsquo;t need college savings money?</h3><p> <br/> If you have more than a couple kids, chances are you will need to dip into savings as the GI Bill won&rsquo;t cover everything for all kids. But, do we ever consider the chances that the children of military parents (if they decide to attend college at all) may qualify for numerous scholarships?  They may end up in ROTC, directly enlist and qualify for the GI Bill themselves, or do what I did and attend a Military Academy. College was free for us!  Well sure, we paid for it in different ways but it was nice not to have to dig into my parents&rsquo; savings.  If one of these scenarios happens with your child, do you want to have 10&rsquo;s of Thousands of dollars locked up in a vehicle with minimal flexibility?  In fact, if you want to use the money for something other than college, not only will you have to then pay taxes on the gains but a 10% penalty to the IRS as well.</p><p> The primary question with any financial plan should always be &ldquo;what is best for us NOW, at this second, going forward in regard to saving and investing?&rdquo;  For the many in the military community with children, the easy answer would be to buy a 529 plan through a well known bank we are all members of.  Its the easy sale.  But the better solution is to implement a plan that will encompass saving for college without negatively impacting your other financial goals.</p><p> So, let&rsquo;s find a solution that will not count against your financial aid package.  It also won&rsquo;t penalize you for using the money for other financial needs, and it will be flexible enough to get the same tax benefits for you, regardless of how you use it.</p><p> I love that we want to do everything for our children.  But sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to forget the bigger picture.  With a &ldquo;Wholistic&rdquo; financial plan, I&rsquo;m pretty confident we can do it all.  </p><p> Are you in a situation where you need to plan for your children&rsquo;s college?  Do you already have a 529 plan?

{"original_id":2740,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Think Twice Before Rehiring Former Employees","link":"think-twice-before-rehiring-former-employees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> While it may be tempting to bring back a former employee, great leaders should give such a practice a second thought.</p><p> I was consulting at a publicly held company that had gone through much change over four years, just like so many other companies that have been trying to adjust to the trials and tribulations of the economy.</p><p> One of their changes was the movement of management team executives. There were terminations, hirings, decisions to not &ldquo;back-fill&rdquo; and then the tenuous &ldquo;re-hire.&rdquo;</p><p> One management position in particular was a revolving door for the company: five leaders in four years. Actually, one individual (Pat) has been the leader three of the five times. Newly rehired, he was beginning his third attempt at this position.</p><p> Why did the company bring him back? In the 18 months since leaving the position, Pat gained in-depth skills and became an expert in Compensation Programs and Organization Design.</p><p> When Pat returned, the company released an in-house statement telling all employees that the company was welcoming Pat upon his return and stating the newly acquired expertise.</p><p> Pat&rsquo;s reputation prior to this third hiring was relatively good. He was a VP with the ability to administrate activities. Known as an excellent delegator, he is excellent at managing up to the next level. However, he is not so good at managing/developing his direct-reports.</p><p> In general, in the past, Pat has always been disrespectful to his direct reports: rarely prompt to meetings, often a no-show, last minute requests on Friday afternoons, poor planning skills and a lack of consideration of others&rsquo; time. He had an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very important&rdquo; mentality justifying his disrespectful behavior.</p><p> When he was brought back to the company, despite his newly acquired expertise to perform at this managerial level, the impact of his re-hiring was felt throughout the organization.</p><p> His disrespect to direct reports did not improve since he was last in the position. Instead, he picked-up where left off:</p><li> He was late to meetings or was a no-show without providing any notification.</li><li> He requested work of subordinates, but then provided no acknowledgement when work was complete.</li><li> He requested work of by direct reports in a last-minute fashion and then did not use the deliverables. In fact, in some cases he discarded them in the presence of the individual. <br/>  </li><p> As a result, employees went online to various social media sites and voiced their thoughts and opinions about the re-hiring of Pat. Most comments showed dissatisfaction about the decision to bring him back. In fact, the criticism was not toward Pat, but toward top-level management and their judgment.</p><p> Many incumbents within the functional area Pat leads stated skepticism, stating:</p><li> Clearly the company is not thinking about progress.</li><li> Upper management must not think much of our function and contribution to the organization.</li><li> What chance of upper movement is there if the company continues to re-hire Pat? Does this imply I am not considered a valued employee for future promotion?</li><li> Is this the company&rsquo;s way of ensuring no further development of people below the management level? There&rsquo;s no investment for the future?</li><li> Is the company comfortable with the status quo? Does this imply that the company wants to stay in the past?</li><li> A &ldquo;no-hire&rdquo; would have been better than Pat&rsquo;s re-hire. No-hire would have been progress. <br/>  </li><p> Then, three incumbents within Pat&rsquo;s functional area resigned voluntarily. During their exit interviews, when they needed to provide a reason for resignation, they stated &ldquo;better opportunity.&rdquo; I probed deeper to discover the truth was directly related to the re-hiring of Pat. They cited the following:</p><li> Pat is self-centered and has never availed training/development to subordinates.</li><li> Disrespectful: requesting work and discarding, no-show to meetings, non-prompt entrance when he does show up.</li><li> Taking credit for other&rsquo;s work.</li><li> Clear statement by organization they are interested in status quo for this department. <br/>  </li><p> Thus, in situations like this, when leaders may consider bringing back a former manager, they really need to give heed because people rarely change their ways. A tiger does not change his stripes.</p><p> Pat returned to a familiar environment and physical location with the same people since his exit. When people return to familiar venues with familiar people, they tend to return to familiar behaviors from that past as well. Pat was no exception and quickly slipped back into his ways of disrespectful behavior.</p><p> While Pat may serve upper management well and hence this was the reason to consider hiring for a third time, one has to wonder, was it worth the residual effect permeating the organization?</p><p> A great leader should ask: Is management&rsquo;s familiarity with this possible rehire better than continuing the search to fill the position?</p><p> Before pursuing a past employee as a rehire always consider:</p><li> Never compromise a hiring decision, no matter the reason.</li><li> It is rarely a better consolation prize filling a position with someone familiar rather than no one.</li><li> Familiarity can breed contempt.</li><li> Survey incumbents directly impacted by a re-hiring. While the incumbents do not make the decision, knowing/understanding their perspective will help address potential issues. <br/>  </li><p> The choice is yours!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 19:00:06.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 19:00:06.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_M3sgLjc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/think-twice-before-rehiring-former-employees/\", \"post_id\": \"6142\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 19:00:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 19:00:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"think-twice-before-rehiring-former-employees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6141\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2814\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/black-and-white-businessman-man-suit-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"904\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442490300,"author_id":458,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2741,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Happens When You Have Different Retirement Planning Goals?","link":"what-happens-when-you-have-different-retirement-planning-goals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s your second marriage or you married late in life. Keeping your finances separate seemed the sensible thing to do. The basic costs such as the mortgage, utilities, taxes and insurances were split 50/50. You took care of your own personal needs and lifestyle costs. You have your own savings and retirement accounts.</p><p> This seems to be working perfectly fine and you assume it will continue on even into retirement. You have your pension from your 30 years of service that will cover your entire half of the basic costs. In addition, you aggressively saved over the years. When the mortgage was paid your portion of the payments was redirected right into your RRSP. You did everything right with the help of your road map created many moons ago by your financial advisor.  <u>  Retirement planning </u>  has never been a worry for you.</p><p> Then the day comes when you decide it is time to take it easy and either slow down at work or stop working permanently. Your dream was to start traveling with your spouse, taking up hobbies and entertaining more. This &lsquo;retirement&rsquo; phase looks to be quite eventful and worry free due to your years of planning and saving.</p><p> However, it dawns on you one day that you and hubby have never actually discussed retirement and what possibilities lay ahead for you both. So one day you approach them and are shocked to learn that their version of &lsquo;retirement&rsquo; is quite different from yours. What do you do then?</p><h3> Retirement Planning With Separate Accounts</h3><p> <br/> Your goal was to stay in the family house as long as possible. Maybe even do Reno&rsquo;s to accommodate future health issues &ndash; anything to avoid the care home life. You also assumed costs in retirement will increase as you are no longer working 50 to 70 hours a week and then going home and zoning out in front of the TV. You now have a lot of time on your hands to fill and you plan on spending whatever it takes to make your days interesting.</p><p> Unfortunately your spouse has  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rhondasherwood.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   never planned for retirement  </a> </u> . This is marriage number two for them. They lost half their assets and half their pension 10 years ago as an aftermath of the divorce. Trying to pay child support and half their current living costs has left very little extra for savings. If anything, they have racked up their line of credit and now have a lot of debt and very little RRSP&rsquo;s. Retirement has never been on the radar even though they are entering their late fifties now. They just assumed they would continue to work until health issues kicked in and then sell the home, down size and hopefully have a bit of money from the sale for some lifestyle costs.</p><p> However, you want to retire at age 57 when your full unreduced pension kicks in. You now find out that your spouse is planning on working until they drop dead. So what do you do?</p><h3> Open the Retirement Planning Conversation</h3><p> <br/> Well this is where a lot of frank conversation needs to take place and a lot of compromises and sacrifices. A &lsquo;no blame&rsquo; open discussion on what your dreams and expectations are is important.</p><p> Start by writing down all your fixed retirement costs. Now tally up each of your &lsquo;guaranteed&rsquo; pension income. Can you each pay half your costs with your pension income? If you can- GREAT! Technically you can retire. The basics are covered. If one of you can&rsquo;t pay your share then compromise needs to take place.</p><p> &bull; Are you willing to downsize the home freeing up some cash for your partner? <br/> &bull; Are you willing to pay more than half your share of the basic costs if it keeps you in the home? <br/> &bull; What if your partner works part-time? Would that cover his shortfall? <br/>  </p><p> If retiring sooner than later is important to you and making that transition with your partner is equally important then you will need to make some real sacrifices if his pension income and savings doesn&rsquo;t cover his share of the costs.</p><p> Next you both need to tackle your individual bucket lists. What do you want to do in your retirement? What dreams and aspirations do you have? Or how do you want to fill your days. If as a couple you have figured out how to pay the basic costs you then need to discuss the &ldquo;extras&rdquo;.</p><p> Lifestyle costs can get expensive. They can add anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 to your budget. If your spouse is challenged just to make their half of the basic or fixed costs then the &ldquo;extras&rdquo; might really be unachievable. What then? Do you have the pension income and savings to fund both your activities? Are you willing to pay more than your fair share and again its all about compromise and sacrifices?</p><p> If you really resent paying the bulk of your retirement expenses you will have to either except that retirement will be a &lsquo;solo&rsquo; journey for you. And you also may have to accept some changes you didn&rsquo;t want to make such as selling the home, relocating to a more affordable city and having less of the extras.</p><p> There is no right or wrong way to live in retirement or decisions how to fund it between spouses. It is whatever agreement each couple has decided works best for them. Often in second marriages people keep their finances separate due to their negative and costly past experiences and because they want to ensure hefty portions of their savings passes on to their children (ensure the Will is properly set up for this). Sometimes couples keep their finances separate because they married late in life and have a hard time compromising or sharing their hard earned monies. Again neither is a right or wrong but you need to discuss your expectations and dreams so when retirement comes you are not completely floored to learn you will be taking the journey on your own.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 19:07:37.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 19:07:37.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_F02apl3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-happens-when-you-have-different-retirement-planning-goals/\", \"post_id\": \"6144\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 19:07:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 19:07:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-happens-when-you-have-different-retirement-planning-goals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6143\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2815\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Retirement-Hammock.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"3507\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442671200,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

In other words, inefficiencies and painpoints identified in the current state will be eliminated when the script is rewritten for the future state. This should be differentiated from a &ldquo;wishful state map,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ll define as an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink-wouldn&rsquo;t-that-be-cool-if-it-could-do-that kind of experience map. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get there someday, but for now, let&rsquo;s focus on what&rsquo;s realistic for the future state, since that&rsquo;s challenging enough for most to achieve. <br/> <br/> I love when people are excited to map the future state; that means that change is about to happen, and for most customer experiences, this is a great thing! But know that the future state map is not the first map you&rsquo;ll ever create, nor is it something you&rsquo;ll do immediately after creating the current state map. There&rsquo;s some research that needs to be done first. <br/> <br/> Why? <br/> <br/> Because you can't transform something you don't understand. <br/> <br/> And you can't jump ahead to the last chapter of the book without reading the 17 chapters that come before it. <br/> <br/> Let&rsquo;s step back a second and look at the current state map. During the current state mapping exercise, you&rsquo;ll uncover what the customer is doing, thinking, and feeling; what&rsquo;s going well; what isn&rsquo;t; and what those key  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/08/moments-of-truth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   moments of truth  </a> </u>  are. Today. What you won&rsquo;t be doing is problem solving or designing the experience of tomorrow. You&rsquo;re not looking for solutions at this stage; you&rsquo;re simply trying to understand what the customer experience is now. <br/> <br/> After that current state map is complete, you are not yet equipped to create a future state map. Why? Because of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/08/the-most-important-rule-of-journey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the most important rule of journey mapping  </a> </u> . If you create a future state map now, you&rsquo;ll be perpetuating  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/08/outside-in-vs-inside-out-thinking.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   inside-out thinking  </a> </u> ; you&rsquo;ll map an experience based on what you believe the customer wants rather than asking &ndash; or listening to &ndash; the customer. There are a couple more steps before you get there. <br/> <br/> Your next step is to ensure you bring the customer voice into the map,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/08/validating-your-journey-maps-for-cx.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   validate  </a> </u>  the current state, and talk to customers about what they are trying to achieve, what problems they are trying to solve, what their expectations are, and more. <br/> <br/> During your map validation exercise - after you've validated the current state - you might pose the following to customers: <br/> <br/> I&rsquo;m going to put you in the driver&rsquo;s seat now. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to think about this task again and tell me how you would design the journey. </p><li> What would the ideal experience look like to you?</li><li> How would you change the process/steps you go through now to {insert your scenario}?</li><p> <br/> Let customers know that you&rsquo;re looking for their ideal experience and that this exercise is informative and will help direct your thinking as you move into ideation, innovation, and redesign. Only with this information can you begin to formulate what the future state map will look like. Create the map based on your customer listening and research. <br/> <br/> Here's the bottom line. We can&rsquo;t design the future state without first understanding the current state. We can&rsquo;t move from current state to future state without customer research. We need to stop ourselves from wanting to design the experience for the customer without customer input. That&rsquo;s how we got to where we are. That&rsquo;s why the experience is what it is today. <br/> <br/> We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. -Albert Einstein</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 19:13:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 19:13:41.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_4qMdiH0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/cant-get-to-future-state-without-knowing-current-state/\", \"post_id\": \"6146\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 19:13:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 19:13:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"cant-get-to-future-state-without-knowing-current-state\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6145\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2816\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442347504183-965bd14449ac-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"805\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442491200,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

Generating a steady flow of client introductions, however, tends to be a significant challenge for most advisors &ndash; constantly concerned about crossing the line between proactive and pushy.</p><p> It&rsquo;s wonderful to have a &ldquo;who&rsquo;s who&rdquo; roster of important and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clientwise.com/blog/-temporary-slug-3559b6d3-548e-4831-bfb5-8a247827e2c2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   influential clients  </a> </u> . And certainly that&rsquo;s a luxury that can greatly aid in opening doors and facilitating new relationships. But it&rsquo;s the what you know about your clients that ultimately will be the principal driver of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clientwise.com/Blog/bid/83230/Building-a-Referral-Process-for-Financial-Advisors-Top-10-Tips\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   introductions  </a> </u> .</p><p> Simply put, the better you know your client, the more you know about their hobbies, their profession and place of employment, nearby close friends and relatives, and groups or associations they belong to, the more you&rsquo;ll be able to strengthen the professional bond, allowing it to cross over to the personal. So start doing a little research on your clients BEFORE you meet with them, and then consider some of the following conversation starters:</p><h3> Associations/groups: <br/>  </h3><li> Don&rsquo;t you belong to the _________?</li><li> Tell me a little more about that? How often and where do you meet?</li><li> What types of things do you talk about?</li><li> Is there a core group of people who always attend and call the shots?</li><li> Tell me a little bit about those people. <br/>  </li><h3> Profession/employer: <br/>  </h3><li> Tell me a little more about your office.  </li><li> How many people work at your facility?</li><li> Do you have a core group of people who you lunch with regularly?</li><li> What types of community service projects is your company involved in?</li><li> I was thinking about contacting [NAME]. Would you be comfortable if I mention that we work together?   <br/>  </li><h3>  Family/friends: <br/>  </h3><li> I noticed on Facebook that your sister and brother-in-law just moved back from ______</li><li> You live in the same subdivision as Dr. ______, don&rsquo;t you? Are you two friendly?</li><li> I know you&rsquo;re an avid golfer&hellip;do you get to play much these days? Do you have a foursome you regularly play with?</li><p> <br/> Finally, try to also leverage these conversations to gather additional  <u>  useful client information </u> . Identifying the name of your clients&rsquo; attorneys and accountants can be a great method of establishing new professional advocates. &ldquo;Last week, I had someone refer me to his estate-planning attorney. It&rsquo;s information I should really have on hand, just in case god forbid anything happened. I&rsquo;ve also had several clients refer me to their accountants around tax time, so that we can work together to resolve any investment-related tax issues. Who&rsquo;s your CPA?&rdquo;</p><h3> Coaching Questions from this article: <br/>  </h3><li> Think about your current approach to client meetings. Are you spending more time talking than listening? What are some ways you can more actively engage your clients in conversation?  </li><li> How much do you really know about your clients&rsquo; lives beyond their financial picture? What sort of approaches might you implement into your process to research and gather more client data and information?</li><li> Are you comfortable asking your existing clients for introductions? Choose two or three key pieces of information that would most help, and then strategize a game plan for how to uncover that information.</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 19:22:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 19:22:55.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_KISot2P.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-you-know-will-open-more-doors-than-who-you-know/\", \"post_id\": \"6148\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 19:22:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 19:22:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-you-know-will-open-more-doors-than-who-you-know\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6147\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2817\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/red-school-blur-factory-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"835\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442486700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2744,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Need a Prenuptial Agreement","link":"why-you-need-a-prenuptial-agreement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjburnscompany\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   JJ Burns  </u> </a>  </p><p> We&rsquo;ve all heard of the celebrity divorces&mdash;and payouts. Remember Tiger Woods&rsquo; massive divorce settlement from Elin Nordegren that was reportedly between $200 to $500 million dollars? Years ago, Amy Irving negotiated her prenup with director Steven Spielberg and also walked away with a substantial sum.</p><p> Over many years of experience, we&rsquo;ve found that prenuptials have been a positive planning vehicle to help create a happy and healthy marriage.</p><h3> A Prenup Makes All the Difference</h3><p> <br/> You don&rsquo;t have to be a celebrity, athlete or a business mogul to benefit from the financial protections of a prenup. They&rsquo;re recommended for everyone.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re like most people, you&rsquo;ve worked hard to save for retirement, invest wisely and perhaps own a property or two. When you think about it collectively, your assets can be worth quite a bit. And you also may not want to take on your spouse&rsquo;s existing debts or other financial issues if your marriage dissolves. This is where a prenup can help protect your assets.</p><p> Now, if you live in any of the nine community property states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin), if you should divorce, you will be required to divide equally all the assets that you acquired during the marriage. In non-community property states, a judge will decide how to divide the property equitably.</p><h3> Protecting Your Finances</h3><p> <br/> A prenuptial agreement, where properly negotiated, can protect you:</p><li> <strong>  If you have greater assets than your spouse. </strong>  A prenuptial agreement can protect your savings and investments in case of divorce. Many people may have accumulated retirement or education funds, or life insurance policies before marriage. They may also independently own property or have an inheritance that they wish to keep intact. A prenup can help give you peace of mind that these funds stay where you have intended.</li><li> <strong>  If you are less affluent than your spouse. </strong>  Prenups are not just for the wealthy. If you happen to have a smaller portfolio than your potential spouse, then you will want to ensure that you are financially protected in case of divorce. The same applies if one spouse plans to stay at home and raise any children. This time out of the workforce impacts the spouse&rsquo;s earning ability and Social Security contributions for several years. A prenup can compensate the stay-at-home spouse for lost earnings.</li><li> <strong>  If you are remarrying </strong> . If you have children from a previous marriage, you may have child support payments, college funding, a home, business or other obligations that you wish to keep within your &ldquo;first&rdquo; family. You may also want to include your new spouse and any children in your wishes. Like a will, a prenup can help ensure that you are able to provide for your families in the manner you intend.</li><li> <strong>  If your potential spouse has a lot of debt. </strong>  Marriage merges many financial obligations. So if you do not want to be responsible for your spouse&rsquo;s student loans, credit card or car loan debt if your marriage should end, then a prenuptial agreement can help protect your individual assets.</li><li> I <strong>  f you are a business owner.  </strong> Your business may be a significant asset. Without a prenuptial agreement, if your marriage ends, your spouse may end up owning a part of the business. If you have business partners, they may not be too pleased to have the ex as part of the deal. A prenup can ensure that your spouse stays out of the business equation.</li><h3> What a Prenuptial Agreement Can&rsquo;t Do</h3><p> <br/> While prenuptial agreements are very useful for financial planning, they cannot be used to resolve general divorce issues such as:</p><li> Determining child support and custodial arrangements.</li><li> Determining who has the right to live or sell the marital home.</li><h3> Helping You Navigate the Financial Waters</h3><p> <br/> Getting married&mdash;or remarried&mdash;is an exciting, happy time. We want to help take the financial stress out of the equation. Some may not see a prenup as the most romantic step toward their future union, however, it can be a useful tool to protect everyone.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 19:31:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 19:31:12.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_f4VArCg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-need-a-prenuptial-agreement/\", \"post_id\": \"6150\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 19:31:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 19:31:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-need-a-prenuptial-agreement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6149\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2818\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MG_2477.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1110\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442510100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Indeed, 53 percent looking to leave said that they would reconsider their decision if their current employers improved their job advancement and promotion prospects.</p><p> In a second  <u>  <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-talent-2020-consumer-products-102213.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Talent Edge 2020 survey  </a> </u>  of executives, 71% of respondents expressed a &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;very high&rdquo; concern about retaining critical talent over the next 12 months, and 66% had the same concern about keeping high-potential talent. As noted in this second report, &ldquo;Since companies can easily match compensation packages, Deloitte believes companies can differentiate themselves in the talent marketplace by going beyond financial incentives and creating customized retention strategies that address issues such as career advancement and greater recognition.&rdquo;</p><h3> COMPENSATION &ne; RETENTION      </h3><h3> COMPENSATION + CAREER GROWTH = RETENTION</h3><p> <br/> Raising salaries, by itself, isn&rsquo;t the solution to an employee retention issue. Giving them the chance to show their stuff, build stronger skills, and grow at the company&mdash;this is the solution, or at least an essential part of the solution.</p><p> The two important takeaways from these Deloitte studies?</p><li> Your people want&mdash;actually demand&mdash;opportunities to grow and fulfill their potential.</li><li> Finding a new job is a hassle, and, all else being equal, employees will stay if they believe their manager will help them grow within the company. <br/>  </li><p> The more skilled and talented employees are, the more likely they are to be motivated to learn new skills, develop their talents and expertise, and improve their perceived value both at your company and in the marketplace. Any top performer who works for you wants to be better tomorrow than they are today. Moreover, those top performers may even be imagining the day when they themselves are in your job or at a similar level within your organization or somewhere else. And that&rsquo;s a good thing. Such ambition should be acknowledged and applauded because it means they&rsquo;re thirsty for more and are driven to excel and grow.</p><p> <strong>  ON POINT </strong> &ndash; When you recognize ambition in your people and help them reach their potential, you&rsquo;ll capture their hearts and souls. As the research shows, most of those who are secretly looking to leave would actually prefer to stay&mdash;as long as you give them a compelling reason to do just that.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 19:37:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 19:37:44.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_f1GWs8s.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-raising-salaries-isnt-the-sure-cure-for-your-employee-retention-problem/\", \"post_id\": \"6152\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 19:37:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 19:37:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-raising-salaries-isnt-the-sure-cure-for-your-employee-retention-problem\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6151\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2819\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-16-at-1.22.05-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"481\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442489400,"author_id":309,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2746,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"abc.xyz for Google","link":"abc-xyz-for-google","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  In case you missed it, Google announces Alphabet.  Welcome to .xyz! </strong></p><p> G is for Google</p><p> As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, &ldquo;Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.&rdquo; As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make &ldquo;smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.&rdquo; From the start, we&rsquo;ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. </p><p> We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven&rsquo;t stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant.</p><p> Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President.</p><p> What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences (that works on the glucose-sensing contact lens), and <a href=\"http://www.calicolabs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Calico </a>  (focused on longevity). Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren&rsquo;t very related.</p><p> Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We&rsquo;ll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we&rsquo;ll determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.</p><p> This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I&rsquo;ve been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation&mdash;continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world&rsquo;s information. Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress. Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth.</p><p> Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort <a href=\"http://www.hooli.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  . </a>  We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure.</p><p> Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG.</p><p> For Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Google&mdash;the birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity&rsquo;s most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it meansalpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for! I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products&mdash;the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.</p><p> We are excited about&hellip;</p><li> Getting more ambitious things done.</li><li> Taking the long-term view.</li><li> Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish.</li><li> Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see.</li><li> Improving the transparency and oversight of what we&rsquo;re doing.</li><li> Making Google even better through greater focus.</li><li> And hopefully&hellip; as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can. <br/>  </li><p> What could be better? No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family. Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re still getting used to the name too!</p><p> <br/> <img alt=\"Larry Page\" src=\"https://abc.xyz/img/signature.jpg\"/></p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-16 20:45:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-16 20:45:23.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_vvaY8bN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/abc-xyz-for-google/\", \"post_id\": \"6154\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-16 20:45:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-16 20:45:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"abc-xyz-for-google\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6153\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2820\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-16-at-1.45.33-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"730\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442500200,"author_id":146,"chart_url":""}

In fact, almost by definition they believe their sole responsibly to their clients is to provide financial advice or guidance to help them reach their financial goals.</p><p> They do so in the mistaken belief that &ldquo;performance&rdquo; is the primary motivator for everyone selecting a financial advisor. After all the thinking goes, &ldquo;if we can produce better returns than the next guy, why wouldn&rsquo;t you select us?&rdquo; </p><p> But any advisor who has been around long enough might tell you it&rsquo;s not that simple though they might be hazy on the details.</p><p> The reality is that women, in particular, rarely, if ever, consider past performance as the most important factor when they are looking for an advisor &ndash; and very few even have stated financial goals.</p><h3> For women financial goals play a backseat role to their emotional goals.</h3><p> <br/> They aren&rsquo;t likely to get excited about a 10% return on equity, but paying off their mortgage three years early or helping kids with tuition is very attractive indeed. One may not be possible without the other but it is the emotional reasons they will consider as their priority.</p><p> So how do you attract female clients? It&rsquo;s not about trying to impress them with your performance. For them it is a given that you know your trade and will work on their behalf. If they didn&rsquo;t believe that, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be in your office to begin with. </p><p> Women want to be listened to and treated with respect. They are looking for advisors who are sincere and authentic, advisors who take the time to learn about them and build a true relationship, not just a financially expedient relationship.</p><p> Recently we interviewed a young woman who had come into some money and was looking for a financial advisor. On friends and colleagues recommendations, she interviewed three. She told us they all seemed to be equally successful, so we asked her how she made her final selection. She said she chose the advisor who made her feel the most comfortable. Rather than tout his own credentials, she told us, he ask about her life, her interest, her hopes and dreams for the future &ndash; not her financial goals. </p><h3> Take away</h3><p> <br/> Listen and act on women&rsquo;s life goals to understand what you need to deliver on the financial side to make those dreams a possibility.</p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

Between my clients, training, and attempts at a life, it's taken me longer than I'd like to admit to crunch the data, come up with solutions, and figure out the best way to support you. </p><p> So, I'm super excited to share 3 things with you today:</p><li> The results of the survey (Yes, you're normal)</li><li> The FREE series you don't want to miss</li><li> A tool to manage distractions (Actually, 15 to be more specific) <br/>  </li><p> So let&rsquo;s get started.</p><p> When surveyed, thousands reported that procrastinating, prioritizing, and managing distractions are their biggest time management struggles. (Check out the results in the word cloud below.)</p><p> So why am I telling you this? To let you know that you&rsquo;re normal and that you're not alone! </p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it. We probably should have been taught &ldquo;Life Skills 101: How To Be An Adult&rdquo; in school. And while I can&rsquo;t give you a time machine, I can give you a solution.

And, I&rsquo;ve got a huge announcement to make soon, but til then, I hope these exercises, tips, infographics, and videos help you to feel more balanced, productive, and energized.</p><p> So here&rsquo;s the first one:  <a href=\"https://alignedholistics.leadpages.co/15-tips/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   15 Tips To Manage Distractions (Infographic)  </u>  . </a>  Most of us take 1 hour to do what we could be doing in 20 minutes. Personally, my weakness is Facebook.

Either way, we all could stand to be more efficient and use the extra time for the things we really want (whether it's fun, family, or a few more hours of sleep!) To make that happen, I created an  <a href=\"https://alignedholistics.leadpages.co/15-tips/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Infographic of the 15 BEST tips to keep you focused (no pills required!)  </u>    </a> And, because I&rsquo;m human (just like you) I have this posted as a reminder on my office wall.

{"original_id":2750,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Intimacy? Are You Serious?","link":"intimacy-are-you-serious","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  What thoughts come to mind when you hear the word intimacy? </strong> This may be a dangerous theme to open with because for many people, the word intimacy feels awkward or uncomfortable. For others, it's almost laughable. With the rise in popularity of personal development and self-help books, blogs, and TV shows, intimacy has become a mainstream buzzword. It's generally used in reference to male/female relationships. You know, you've seen the women's magazine article: \"Six Ways to Improve Intimacy with Your Partner&hellip;Tonight.\" I think the word intimacy has gotten a bad rap simply because it's misunderstood, much like the term \"affirmation\" did back in the days of Stuart Smalley on Saturday Night Live. Remember his powerful affirmation? \"I'm good enough, smart enough, and gosh darn it, people like me.\" We all had a good laugh and dismissed as nonsense what is actually a pretty useful development tool.</p><p> Same thing goes for intimacy. Many people have been turned off simply because of incorrect or over usage. So, before we go any further, I'm asking you to release any preconceived notions of intimacy. For us to build lifelong and multigenerational clients, we need it.</p><h3> Why Intimacy?</h3><p> <br/> I use intimacy for two reasons. First, it's because I truly believe it's the best word for what we are trying to create. And, secondly, because I feel it causes us to think. And isn't that really the definition of learning? After all, as professor and author Howard Hendricks said, \"It's not what you think you are; rather it's what you think, you are.\"</p><p> If we look at the word intimate, it comes from the Latin intima, signifying the deepest, most internal part of something. The key word here to me is something. I argue that of all the service providers your clients have-as well as the prospective time-stealers and those attempting to add some value in the lives of your clients-your role and duty is the deepest, most internal part of their life. Not more important or deeper than their family or faith, perhaps, but certainly deeper and more internal than say, the mechanic, plumber, local politician, medical doctor, or nurse. Medical doctor? Really? Yes, perhaps even him or her.</p><p> There is one thing that each medical professional has in common. Eventually he or she will lose 100% of their clients, which he or she calls patients. Each one of them will die. But what you do, the trusted wealth professional, has the ability to go on for generation after generation. That's powerful.</p><p> In medicine, the intima is the inner lining of the arteries, the tunica interna, or inner coat. This joins with the endocardium, the inner lining of the heart. The intimate layer is the most profound and the most tender. To be intimate with another is to be open and uncover one's inner thoughts. We tend to do this with great anxiety and vulnerability, but that's exactly what is needed from you with your best clients to create the mutual intimacy that leads to lifelong relationships and passes to future generations.</p><h3> Why Does Intimacy Matter?</h3><p> <br/> The data and the told and untold stories of this industry indicate that most of your clients don't feel that you care about them, their family and their needs. You may care about the size of their wealth, the products they use, and the \"suitability\" for those products. Consider this:</p><li> <strong>  98% of adult children switch financial advisers once they have received their inheritance from their parents. (\"Engaging and Retaining Families,\" Investments &amp; Wealth Monitor, IMCA, September/October 2011) </strong></li><li> <strong>  On average, affluent clients with more than $5M in assets have seven advisers in their lifetime. </strong></li><li> <strong>  25% of the affluent claim they are looking for a new \"planner\" not because of performance, but rather, lack of contact. (Phoenix Wealth Management Survey.) </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Therefore, intimacy in your practice with your best clients matters because it's how you will perform your noble calling, attract and keep your clients, and inherit more clients because of not just what you do for them, but how you do it.</p><p> In journalist Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink (Back Bay Books, 2005), he looks at medical professionals and their likelihood of being sued for malpractice. The net of the example is those medical professionals whose patients consider them to have a favorable bedside manner, regardless of their technical proficiency and competency of the MD, were less likely to be sued for malpractice than those doctors who had real or perceived bad bedside manner. He found out that in many cases, the patient's feelings of a good bedside manner versus a bad bedside manner came from just three minutes more of dialogue (connection) with the patient. That was from 15 minutes to 18 minutes of intimacy. A bit of interest, compassion, and concern from the doctor created a much healthier, productive, and profitable relationship. It was not just the medicine; it was also the relationship.</p><p> So, three more minutes of genuine, caring conversation means a doctor is less likely to be sued than a doctor who is technically more proficient, but perceived as less caring, compassionate, and does not take the time to know his or her patient. What does this have to do with you, the wealth professional? Everything. I believe this example is absolutely transferable to your business and our industry. We need to improve our bedside manner (our intimacy) for all the right reasons.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 17:15:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 17:15:14.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_emRc3Qg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/intimacy-are-you-serious/\", \"post_id\": \"6163\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 17:15:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 17:15:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"intimacy-are-you-serious\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6162\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2824\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-10.17.09-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"990\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442592000,"author_id":490,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2751,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Computer Says No, But We Have Alternative Funding.","link":"computer-says-no-but-we-have-alternative-funding","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Alternative funding organisations offer customers borrowing capabilities that traditional banks are unable or unwilling to support. Bank finance and alternative finance is currently run very separately, but with the threat of legislation upon banks, as suggested by the Basel Committee, which could force them to to give more information to customers about alternative lending options, there is now an opportunity to get ahead of the regulations and find a mutually beneficial way to work with alternative funding providers.</p><p> With a new approach to working together, banks and alternative funding providers could create comprehensive financial packages that promote entrepreneurial spirit and support SME growth, while being more transparent and making it easier for SMEs to understand their options and choose the best one for them.</p><h3> The many guises of crowdfunding</h3><p> <br/> The term &ldquo;alternative funding&rdquo;, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;alternative finance&rdquo;, covers a wide range of funding sources. Crowdfunding is the one that has hit the headlines and created mass awareness of these opportunities. Crowdfunding sites have given individuals a new route into the investment market, as well as giving community-based projects a way to channel their messages and gain donations.</p><p> The primary alternative funding models are summarised below:</p><p> <strong>  o      Investment-based crowdfunding </strong>  is where investors fund projects in return for a financial gain, either in terms of equity or interest payments.</p><p> <strong>  o      Equity based crowdfunding  </strong> is a lending model whereby a person or organisation can appeal to many investors to buy equity in their business in return for funding. Using online platforms, brands such as Indiegogo, GoFundMe and Crowdfunder connect would-be investors with new start-ups, brands, or causes that need a cash injection.</p><p> <strong>  o      Peer to peer lending </strong>  sites, such as Funding Circle, connect businesses with multiple small investors to acquire the funds they need. The business pays interest on the amount borrowed. In April, Funding Circle announced that it had completed $150m of fundraising, resulting in the business being valued at $1bn in under 5 years.</p><p> <strong>  o      Donation-based crowdfunding </strong>  is popular for charities, arts, and cause-related fundraising in situations where an investor is generally motivated by a social or moral cause to participate.</p><p> <strong>  o      Reward or incentive based crowdfunding </strong>  typically offers an escalating level of reward in return for increased investment. Rewards may include discounted products, VIP access to new products or events, or simply an email of thanks or a mention on social media. Kickstarter is a great example.</p><p> <strong>  o      Online loan platforms </strong>  enable users to set and control the amount of money they require, and select a suitable repayment term. Some of these platforms demand astronomical APRs, but they can feed a need for quick turnaround of cash provision which can be available within days or hours instead of weeks or months.</p><h3> We&rsquo;ve already said no</h3><p> <br/> Many in the banking industry fear alternative funding providers, but I believe this fear is unfounded. Those who look for alternative funding typically do so only after approaching (and being turned down by) traditional banks. John Allan, the National Chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses, recently reported that 35 per cent of SMEs are still being refused loans by the big four banks. Faced with a closed door, these businesses are looking at alternative funding solutions for the means to make their ambitions a reality.</p><p> Another reason why SMEs are flocking to alternative funding providers is that they can move quickly; Ezbob claims to be able to approve loans of up to &pound;120,000 online in just 30 minutes. By uploading business accounts, bank statements and other key financial data, the computer systems are able to calculate risk and determine an offer for the customer without the applicant leaving their desk. This may be more of a concern for the banks, who are often saddled with clunky legacy systems that do not enable them to move quite as fast this, but even if they could, the risks of lending in this way would currently be too great for the banks to take on.</p><p> Alternative funding providers can take the risks traditional banks do not allow, and offer customers increased flexibility in the face of rigidity. This model can work in harmony with the banks&rsquo; lower-risk policies without giving the banks anything to fear &ndash; after all, these are customers who they have already turned down.</p><h3> The rise of alternative finance</h3><p> <br/> Alternative funding is growing at an astonishing rate, almost doubling in value year on year for the last five years, to an estimated value of &pound;1.74 billion in the UK alone in 2014. Total lending by the industry has now reached &pound;3.15 billion. This growth is partly attributable to the financial crash, which saw traditional banks less able to take risks with business or personal loans. Along with social trends and technical advances which have seen an increase in online peer to peer collaboration and a decrease in the monopolies of traditional organisations, conditions have been perfect for the exponential growth of alternative funding.</p><h3> Reining in the crowd </h3><p> <br/> In October 2013, the FCA announced plans to impose new rules on the crowdfunding market, afraid that naive investors could be lured into crowdfunding in search of healthy returns for their savings, with little awareness or consideration of the risks. The new rules came into place in April 2014, introducing criteria for investors&rsquo; eligibility to ensure they are aware up-front of the risks of their investments, and able to withstand any losses they may incur.</p><p> Investment-based crowdfunding platform providers are now only allowed to market crowdfunding opportunities to regular investors, or those that take regulated advice, or those who can confirm their investment does not exceed 10 per cent of their net assets.</p><p> And it is not only the regulator who is apprehensive about alternative funding practices. Research carried out by Nesta and the University of Cambridge (Understanding Alternative Finance: The UK Alternative Finance Industry Report 2014) found that would-be customers also have concerns about using the services. A lack of regulation sparks fears over safety and longevity, and a lack of understanding of alternative funding business models makes it uncomfortable to proceed. I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t also confess to having concerns when reading about some of these practices during the research for this blog.</p><h3> The vital role of traditional lenders</h3><p> <br/> Removing some of this anxiety and concern for customers who are dealing with alternative funding is where banks could come into their own. As trusted experts in the lending markets, the banks could take up the role of offering help and advice to customers who have not met the criteria for traditional lending services, but need guidance in finding an appropriate alternative finance solution.</p><p> A long-term lending package, in consultation with a bank, could combine alternative finance solutions for a business while they are still considered high risk, with the conditional acceptance of a more traditional bank loan further down the line. This would set the business up for a financially healthy future, as long as they can get through the more risky early stages.</p><p> Being open to working with alternative funding providers could help banks to re-establish their reputations as enablers rather than obstructors. Embracing innovative and colloraborative alternative finance models would allow banks to access new markets and new technologies, while demonstrating that they are modern &lsquo;full service&rsquo; customer-centric brands, focused on helping customers find the most appropriate solution at the time of need. Collaboration such as this would bring good old-fashioned banking principles to our digital age &ndash; and not a moment too soon.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 17:28:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 17:28:20.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Y6vcIwk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/computer-says-no-but-we-have-alternative-funding/\", \"post_id\": \"6165\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 17:28:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 17:28:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"computer-says-no-but-we-have-alternative-funding\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6164\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2825\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-10.28.02-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"514\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442603700,"author_id":129,"chart_url":""}

We may be at the end of the rope while working on a project or we may be experiencing a sense of isolation as a solo entrepreneur. It may seem that everyone around us is moving forward while we are tethered to the same workload or types of opportunities coming our way. This happens to all of us and can actually build if we don&rsquo;t choose to  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/06/16/are-you-tired-of-your-leadership-routine/#sthash.8qXCo6rP.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   make a change  </u>  . </a> Working with many managers and collaborating with influential leaders, I understand these feelings of discomfort and frustration. Here are some great strategies to propel you into a more positive mindset and they all involve leaving the leadership comfort zone.</p><h3> 1. Admit Discomfort</h3>Before we can address our need to change things up, we have to acknowledge that something is not working as well as it could. I recently asked a manager these questions:<li> What is at the center of your frustration?</li><li> If you could change the team direction or choices, what would it look like?</li><li> What is within your control and what is not?</li><li> How do your personal values align with your workplace values?</li><strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The+first+step+in+making+a+leadership+change+is+admitting+discomfort.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/07/20/five-ways-to-leave-the-leadership-comfort-zone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The first step in making a leadership change is admitting discomfort. </a></strong><h3> 2. Think of a Leader You Admire</h3>I begin many of my leadership presentations, by asking the attendees to think about a great leader in their life. Then we talk about what behaviors or attitudes that make that individual a role model for them. A fascinating discussion usually follows as each person comes to realize what leadership means to them. By reflecting on the meaningful leaders in our lives, we can identify the leadership behaviors that are important to us. If you want to learn more about how to use this activity for yourself or your team, just <a href=\"https://www.terriklassconsulting.com/empowered-leadership-ebook/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> download</a> it here.<h3> 3. Create a Visual</h3>Sometimes words need to be supported by images to help us discover our leadership change. Step out of your comfort zone using pictures that you either download or draw or photograph that help you visualize how the change may look. Put them up on a flip chart or whiteboard or bulletin board. Just find a place that is easy to see and can be a reminder of your next steps.<strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Images+can+empower+leaders+to+see+the+changes+they+need+to+make.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/07/20/five-ways-to-leave-the-leadership-comfort-zone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Images can empower leaders to see the changes they need to make. </a></strong><h3> 4. Ask a Question</h3>No leader is an island. No leader needs to stand alone. When we are feeling confusion, there is nothing more comforting than to speak to someone we trust or admire about our situation. Sometimes just sharing our thoughts out loud makes them real and empowers us to take action. This may be a perfect time to <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/06/09/finding-a-magical-leadership-mentor/#sthash.Tu2gSkC0.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> find a mentor</a> who can guide us with their perspective as well as present us with possible alternatives. Some questions we might want to ask them are:<li> How would you handle my decision?</li><li> Have you ever been in my shoes and what did you do?</li><li> Where else might I turn for direction?</li><li> What do you see as my risks and my true benefits in choosing a certain direction?</li><h3> 5. Design a Plan of Action</h3>After we have looked inside and turned to those around us, it is time to make a concrete plan. List the next steps with deadlines, breaking them down into more manageable pieces if necessary.

{"original_id":2753,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Influential or Invisible as a Leader?","link":"are-you-influential-or-invisible-as-a-leader","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Influence. Persuade. Convince. Sway. Engage. Motivate.  </strong> <br/> Your team. Your organization. Your community. Your relationships. Yourself.  <br/> <br/> How do you use your leadership voice to influence&hellip;to get the outcomes you want? To get the results you desire? To make your vision come alive? To realize your purpose?  <br/> <br/> What does being influential look like? How do you get people to follow you&hellip;to listen to you&hellip;to believe in you&hellip;to trust you?  <br/> <br/> Influence is not about your title: CEO. Manager. Parent. Owner. VP. Supervisor. You don&rsquo;t need a title to influence. You need confidence in your ability to set a vision and rally your tribe around that vision.  <br/> <br/> Influence is not about speaking LOUDER or SHOUTING your opinions. That only makes you look weak&hellip;not persuasive. Many times, the people have the most influence are not the people in power. The successful influencers have a quiet voice which is used as an persuasive force not only for their needs but for the needs of others as well.  <br/> <br/> Becoming a captivating leader who can influence means having a calm yet strong and confident tone so that your impact is understood and respected.  <br/> <br/> If you've been following our series about Finding Your VOICE as a Leader, you know that defining your values and establishing your outcomes are essential parts of becoming an effective leader.  <br/> <br/> However, discovering your values while aligning your outcomes aren't enough to Find Your VOICE as a Leader. You need to be able to inspire your team to achieve your vision. In other words, you need to develop and flex your persuasive muscle to engage your followers so that you are influential, not invisible. </p><h3> How do you build your Influence?</h3><p> <br/> Once you have identified your Values and created your Outcomes as a leader, how do you Influence and align yourself and your team to maximize your opportunities and garner the needed results? Recognizing and developing your spheres of influence is key to being successful in finding and using your leadership VOICE. To do this, you need to follow these steps:  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. You need to cultivate a trustworthy network. </strong>  Networking may be a catch-phrase from the 1980s, but the concept is as relevant today as it was thirty years ago. No one person has all of the answers or all of the ideas. The larger you build your community as a leader, the more opportunity you will have to influence and be influenced.  <br/> <br/> In addition, becoming a successful influencer means that you focus on what can you influence versus what you cannot. In other words, you need to determine your &ldquo;spheres of influence&rdquo; so you can focus your values and your outcomes on what you can change&hellip;what you can influence. Don&rsquo;t waste your time and energy on things you cannot change. Understand the difference.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. You need to sell your ideas.  </strong> Even the best ideas will languish if you're the only one who supports them. A good leader needs to also be a good salesperson--to garner support from your peers, from your leaders, from your investors, from your clients, from team members and from your community. Although considerable effort goes into the creation of your leadership vision, the harder part may be selling and advocating your vision so that people get onboard because they want to get onboard&hellip;not because they have no choice. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;telling&rdquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s &ldquo;selling.&rdquo; So don&rsquo;t shy away from being a salesperson&hellip;it&rsquo;s a key role that leaders play to realize their vision and build their influence. </p><p> <strong>  3. You need to be self-aware. </strong>  The best--and most effective--leaders know how to adjust their style to fit the diverse individuals and different types of teams they work with. To be successful in influencing your outcomes is to really believe in your values&hellip;your beliefs. How can you expect people to believe in what you say if you don&rsquo;t really believe it yourself? How can you expect to influence people, if you are not clear on the values that influence you? Knowing who you are as a leader: your strengths, your weaknesses, your ethics, your judgments, your preferences, your reactions, your insights&hellip;provides you the mirror and reflection so that you establish trust, credibility and influence within all of your relationships&hellip;and not remain invisible.  Let go of your ego.  <br/> <br/> By integrating the Emergenetics Profile into my executive coaching practice, I am able to guide leaders into greater insight and awareness of what is important to them in their life, and, thus, how creating their vision with aligned outcomes impact their leadership brand and create the vision they desire.  <br/> <br/> Finding your VOICE as a leader does not mean shouting to make an impact&hellip;it means using the Emergenetics Profile to reveal your brilliance as a leader by: </p><li> Discovering your critical leadership Values;</li><li> Creating a compelling vision to obtain the Outcomes you need; </li><li> Influencing your relationships with trust and credibility;</li><li> Making decisions that reveal your Courage and confidence to take a stand;</li>And<li> Communicating your overall Expression for lasting impact. </li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 17:48:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 17:48:22.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Y4BdITX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-influential-or-invisible-as-a-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"6169\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 17:48:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 17:48:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-influential-or-invisible-as-a-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6168\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2827\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-11.02.43-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"736\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442595600,"author_id":382,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2754,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Joy of Marketing: A Thoroughly Modern Financial Services Love Story","link":"the-joy-of-marketing-a-thoroughly-modern-financial-services-love-story","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  Danielle Stitt </u> Love your customers and they&rsquo;ll love you back. That&rsquo;s a key lesson from four days at Hubspot&rsquo;s #Inbound15 conference held in Boston, Massachusetts last week. And here is my step-by-step guide on how to build, spread and share that love.Inbound marketing is a movement. And it&rsquo;s a movement that&rsquo;s growing quickly if the 40% increase in conference attendees from last year is any indication. More important to us as marketers is why it&rsquo;s growing so fast. From my discussions with attendees from all over the US and the world the answer is clear: because inbound marketing works.Take conference organiser, the marketing and sales software company Hubspot, Inc.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/hubspot-reports-q2-2015-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What started as a two-man idea at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004 is now a 15,000 customer operation working in 90 countries on track to deliver revenue of US$172 million by the end of 2015  </a> </u> . All based on using the inbound methodology.In 1965, marketing was outbound, disruptive and it worked. With outbound marketing we interrupt whatever the customer is watching, reading or listening to with an ad or telemarketing call. Indeed, marketers in the era of Mad Men had it easy. They wrote an ad, bought media space, headed out to lunch with their girlfriends then home for dinner with the wife. Job done.Fast forward to 2015 and our audiences are blind to ads, have out of control inboxes, don&rsquo;t necessarily trust brands anymore and prefer to do their own research. They don&rsquo;t want to be disrupted.</p><h3> In 2015 the audience is king. Disruptive marketing no longer works.</h3>Inbound marketing at its core is about thinking about how we can be truly helpful to our prospects &ndash; and in so doing turn them into customers. By being helpful we become the brand our audience trusts, want to do business with (when the time is right) and ultimately love enough to tell their friends about.So how do we, as marketers, achieve this with the best marketing budget ROI? IN other words, how do we build, spread and share the love?<h3> Step 1: Know thy customer &ndash; it&rsquo;s all about the &ldquo;why&rdquo;</h3>Before you switch off, thinking &ldquo;yeah, heard the persona gospel before&rdquo;, consider these two questions that go to the heart of nailing your personas:<li> Why do customers buy from you in the first place?</li><li> And why do they keep coming back?</li>Yes, you&rsquo;ll also need to answer all the usual persona questions about demographics, lifestyle, pain/problem to be solved and so on, but remain focused on those two questions to stay on track.To help you out, try this neat buyer persona building tool [hyperlink:<a href=\"http://www.makemypersona.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  www.makemypersona.com </u></a>]. But go further to understand how and why they come to you at each stage of their buying journey to ensure you&rsquo;re helping to solve the right problems at the right stage.<strong> Pro tip:</strong>Three personas is usually the maximum. Ideally narrow it down to one or two. If you think you need more, go back to the &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions. While a potential additional persona may seem different from others at first glance, if they have a similar &ldquo;why&rdquo; they would come to you as your other persona/s, you may find that in practice, you already have them covered.<h3> Step 2: Be helpful &ndash; and get smart with search</h3>This is where your content comes into play.Brainstorm the problems each persona may face at different stages of their journey and the searches they might use to solve them. So, early stage problem solving might involve general searches such as &ldquo;licences for accountants&rdquo;. As your prospects work their way towards a solution, searches becomes more specific, for example: &ldquo;best solution for accountant looking to partner&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll need to be prepared with content that addresses your potential customers&rsquo; enquiries as they narrow in on the specifics of solving their problems.<strong> Pro tip:</strong>Top of the funnel (TOFU &ndash; a new buzzword I just picked up) searches tend to be shorter phrases, often using plural nouns (accountants). Middle and bottom of the funnel (MOFU and BOFU respectively &ndash; are you loving the buzzword bingo?) searches involve longer keyword phrases and singular nouns (accountant).<h3> Step 3: Be found &ndash; spread the love</h3>You may be the most loving financial service brand ever but unless people know about you it&rsquo;s all for naught. While creating your helpful content, make sure you&rsquo;re thinking about how you can amplify it across channels. For example, pull out great sentences that could be scheduled as tweets, think about 5 top tips that would make a good blog post or visually represent your report in an infographic (canva.com is a great free tool for creating these).Use these teasers to encourage people to read your content and include social sharing buttons so they can share with their networks. Let them spread the love.<strong> Pro tip:</strong>You can pay to promote your content but paid options work best when they appear as a natural find. Great examples of this are sponsored stories in Taboola or Outbrain or in social networks&rsquo; news feeds such as those on LinkedIn and Twitter. Just remember what mindset your customers are in and craft your message so it&rsquo;s the right content, in the right place at the right time.Of course this is a medium to longer-term strategy. It will take some patience to plan, execute, test and iterate before you become masterful. However, the rewards are a plenty and the field is open to those who are ready to move early.

If you really want to get your name out there and extend your social reach (who doesn't?), then you need to focus on boosting your company mentions.</p><p> A company 'mention' simply means every time someone posts about your brand on social media - a Twitter retweet, a LinkedIn share, an Instagram repost for instance. Ultimately, the more mentions, the wider your reach. But, you first have to convince users to become social advocates of your brand and share your content. Here are some tips on how you can do just that, as outlined in a recent Business2Community article:</p><h3> Interact: It's called 'social' media for a reason! </h3><p> <br/> Think of content creation as having a big conversation with your audience. The best posts prompt a response &ndash; ask questions, ask for feedback, reply to comments, thank customers for their comments, etc.</p><p> <strong>  Snap happy: </strong>  Visual content - including images - is more likely to get shared than text-based posts. Nevertheless, those images need be shareable! Memes, quote-based images and funny pics all stand a good chance of being shared. You could also share 'behind the scenes' snaps of your company - the office, your team, any milestones you celebrate or events you attend. These personal photos will help users identify with your brand which could boost loyalty - and mentions.</p><p> <strong>  Get social on the weekends:  </strong> Many marketers believe that Monday and Tuesday are the best days to post viral content. However, as weekends tend to be a little quieter on the social front, they provide an ideal opportunity for new and small businesses to \"create some noise and gain traction for their brands.\" Got better things to do with your Saturday? Simply schedule your posts beforehand.</p><p> <strong>  Make 'em smile: </strong>  If you fancy yourself a bit of a comedian and think you can make people laugh without being too cheesy or offensive, then go for it. Funny jokes, images and videos all get plenty of shares. We all love a light-hearted post, particularly on a wet Monday morning.</p><p> <strong>  Add value: </strong>  Think of ways you can add value to your content marketing. For instance, you could create an informative, industry-related 'how to' guide or video tutorial consumers will find useful and may share with their own community. Or, you could share insightful, engaging blog posts that will provoke a response from users; better still, write your own and impress your social media community with your knowledge.</p><p> Any other tips for boosting company mentions on social media?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 18:32:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 18:32:17.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_tHlnISa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/social-success-some-tips-for-boosting-your-companys-mentions/\", \"post_id\": \"6173\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 18:32:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 18:32:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"social-success-some-tips-for-boosting-your-companys-mentions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6172\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2829\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-11.34.45-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"319\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442599200,"author_id":492,"chart_url":""}

But in April 2014,  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/investment/im-guidance-2014-04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  the SEC issued new guidelines on the use of social media and online communications, </a>  which opened the door to something new: the ability for advisors share on their own websites and profile pages public comments about their services that are posted on independent websites (such as Yelp, Angie&rsquo;s List, Wallet Hub, and GuideVine).There are, of course, rules related to how the content from these third-party sites can be used on sites and profile pages the advisory firm controls. Here&rsquo;s how to think things through.</p><h3> No Cherry Picking</h3>The advisor must include both positive and negative reviews. This means there can be no cherry picking &mdash; the advisor must publish all comments, unedited. Financial advisors can&rsquo;t just copy and paste the good ones and leave the bad ones behind on the third-party site.The SEC guidance specifically says: &ldquo;The investment adviser may publish only the totality of the testimonials from an independent social-media site and may not highlight or give prominence to a subset of the testimonials.&rdquo;Advisors can also publish mathematical averages of the comments from third-party review sites.The best way to benefit from the third-party review sites, according to many industry consultants, is to post the logo and a link to the page where the third-party reviews live.In this writer&rsquo;s opinion, it could be worth linking to the third-party review page and monitoring daily to ensure that one is comfortable with any new comments. If the comments on the third-party review site ever become a concern, advisors have a couple choices &mdash; remove the logo and link to the third-party site or embrace the fact that studies show that companies that have a disproportionate number of marginal or negative reviews are seen as more credible and real.<h3> Consumer Trust Building</h3>Stats from social commerce company <u> <a href=\"http://www.reevoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Reevoo </a></u> show that, while it may seem counterintuitive, the presence of a few bad reviews is actually a good thing.&ldquo;Reevoo found that people that seek out and read bad reviews convert better, as the very fact that they are paying such close attention means they are more likely to be in purchase mode,&rdquo; says writer Vikki Chowney in <u> <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/8638-bad-reviews-improve-conversion-by-67\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  an article on eConsultancy.com </a></u>. &ldquo;68% of consumers trust reviews more when they see both good and bad scores, while 30% suspect censorship or faked reviews when they don&rsquo;t see any negative opinions on the page.&rdquo;The <u> <a href=\"http://www.edelman.com/2015-edelman-trust-barometer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Edelman Trust Barometer </a></u> shows that people now trust one another more than they do established institutions. People have always turned to their peers when making important decisions. Now, with social media&rsquo;s impact on online search, it is easier than ever for those doing research online to find &ldquo;a person like me&rdquo; or &ldquo; a regular employee&rdquo; &mdash; both of which are seen as more credible than a company executive or paid spokesperson.For more insights on building trust online read this Marie Swift piece on Financial-Planning.com: <u> <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/blogs/why-advisors-cant-ignore-social-media-2693601-1.html?utm_campaign=Jul%2023%202015-daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;ET=financialplanning%3Ae4808514%3Aa%3A&amp;st=email\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why Financial Advisors Can&rsquo;t Ignore Social Media </a></u>.<h3> No Influence on Third-Party Sites</h3>The SEC guidelines also state that financial advisors must not have the ability to influence comments from the general public on the third-party site. This means the advisor must not try to influence how they&rsquo;re portrayed on those third-party sites. The SEC is trying to ensure that potential clients get the full picture of an advisory firm.&ldquo;Advisers would violate the SEC&rsquo;s testimonial rule if they drafted or submitted comments to a third-party review site, paid others to submit favorable comments to the site or suppressed, edited or manipulated the order in which the commentary was presented,&rdquo; said tenured industry writer Mark Schoeff, Jr. in this article published by Investment News, <u> <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140401/free/140409995/sec-oks-use-of-third-party-social-media-endorsements\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SEC Oks Use of Third Party Social Media Endorsements </a></u>.<h3> Content Neutral Line-Up</h3>Beyond just the &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; restriction covered in the &ldquo;no cherry picking&rdquo; section of this article, Registered Investment Advisers must keep in mind that they may only publish testimonials from an independent review website in a &ldquo;content-neutral manner.&rdquo; According to the SEC guidelines, this means chronological or alphabetical order. It is not okay to put the best rankings at the top and the worst rankings at the bottom.This is one reason why this writer believes it is best to simply link to the third-party review site and then monitor the discussion threads on a daily basis.<h3> Be Careful What You Post on Third-Party Sites</h3>What would you do if you saw this post on a third-party review site?&ldquo;Found Jake Advisor to be out of touch, unresponsive and arrogant.&rdquo;How about this one?&ldquo;I have known John Planner for many years. One of the nicest guys you will ever meet! He knows his business and will take GREAT care of you and your assets.&rdquo;It is human nature to want to applaud the person posting the positive comment &mdash; but financial advisors should refrain from doing anything that might be construed as encouraging positive comments. So the best thing to do when a financial advisor sees a positive comment is to do nothing &mdash; at least not publically. It would be nice however to say, &ldquo;thanks for your kind comments on xyz review site,&rdquo; over a cup of coffee, while at the same time explaining why you can&rsquo;t try to encourage positive endorsements online.In the case of the negative comment above, it is human nature to want to defend oneself. As a marketing communications and reputation expert, this writer believes that it would be best if the advisor in question posted something simple such as, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. Please call me to discuss.&rdquo;, if the third-party site allows responses. And leave it at that. Check with compliance first, of course, to make sure their interpretation of the SEC guidelines is in alignment with this reputational recommendation.<h3> Bottom Line</h3>&ldquo;This rule would appear to put advisers in the clear regarding third-party review sites, such as Yelp, presuming that the adviser really does not have any affiliation to the site, and cannot control the comments posted (e.g., by trying to delete negative comments while allowing positive ones to remain),&rdquo; said Michael Kitces, director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group, on his blog, Nerd&rsquo;s Eye View.Check with your company&rsquo;s compliance department to learn more about internal policies and procedures and/or outside legal counsel to make sure all regulatory guidelines are being met at your firm. A recent report from McGladrey, LLC, a leading provider of assurance, tax and consulting services in the US, says that financial firms should be prepared for <u> <a href=\"https://rsmus.com/what-we-do/industries/financial-services/resources/investment-industry-insights-subscription/is-your-fund-prepared-for-the-secs-heightened-regulatory-focus-.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Heightened SEC Regulatory Focus </a></u>.

This is a period of explosive personal growth when an individual crosses over from a dependent child to an independent adult who no longer relies on their parents to provide food, clothing, shelter, laundry services, and gas money.   (This transition is not happening  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/yes-20-somethings-are-taking-longer-to-grow-up-but-why/265750/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   as early as it once did  </a> </u>  in America, but that&rsquo;s fodder for another blog.) </p><p> To assure a successful launch into adulthood and a path to a meaningful career, the emerging teen/young adult benefits from the help and support of three separate&ndash;but equally important individuals.</p><p> <strong>  THE MOTHER:  </strong> Throughout the transition, and even after they establish their independence, a young adult still needs a mother who is standing by to:</p><p> A) Provide advice (which is usually only followed if/when it&rsquo;s asked for).</p><p> B) Encourage them to endure the tough times and to help them understand why it&rsquo;s in their best interests to always take the high road and choose the difficult right over the easy wrong.</p><p> C) Give unconditional love, plenty of hugs, and an occasional bowl of homemade soup.</p><p> D) Push the bird out of the nest and let them fly &ndash; or fall &ndash; on their own accord. (Very difficult step for today&rsquo;s growing legion of tiger moms &ndash; and dads &ndash; who believe their job is to protect their adult children from the realities of this harsh world and to serve as their landlords, bankers, chief negotiators, agents, and best buddies.)</p><p> <strong>  THE MANAGER: </strong>  A manager&rsquo;s job is to get as much out of their employees as possible in the way of productivity and performance. This is optimized when the manager has taken the initiative to forge a relationship based on mutual trust and common interests, but if that occurs it is a bonus; not a condition of employment.</p><p> The manager must then:</p><p> A) Tell the employee what to do (i.e. provide clear and measurable results, training, and methodologies).</p><p> B) Give them the tools and workplace environment to do it.</p><p> C) Keep the employee on track toward the goals (holding them accountable for their outcomes).</p><p> D) Provide praise and recognition when deserved, and correction and discipline when required.</p><p> <strong>  THE MENTOR: </strong> In the classic Greek poem  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/context.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Odyssey  </a> </u> , Oddysseus entrusts his wise friend, Mentor, with the education and counseling of his adult son Telemachus. The word mentor is derived from that origin and is now used to describe one who accepts the responsibility for the professional growth and development of another by providing sage advice, counsel, and guidance.

{"original_id":2758,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Inconsistent Bossing: A Surefire Way to Disengage","link":"inconsistent-bossing-a-surefire-way-to-disengage","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We all have those days when our words and actions don't come out the way we intended. Or we take our stress out on others. We intend to give a compliment or a simple criticism and it instead sounds more critical than we really feel. Between friends, a simple &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m just stressed lately&rdquo; can repair these missteps. Our friends know that just because we were their loyal confidante one day and a nutcase the next is not necessarily a reflection on the friendship itself. The workplace, however, is a more delicate environment and a simple &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; may not be as effective, or even appropriate if we are talking about the dynamic between boss and employee. </p><p> Though we hate to admit it, our bosses can change the emotional tone of our day with a couple words, either encouraging or critical. Thus, it is extremely important for a boss to watch how they reinforce their employees&rsquo; behavior and maintain consistency. Inconsistent bossing can turn a great employee who is excited to come to work every day into a disgruntled nonplussed employee who allows him/herself to become complacent and disinterested.</p><h3> If a boss changes their tune on a daily basis, an employee will become confused.</h3><p> <br/> If an employee receives a &ldquo;Great job!&rdquo; one day and then a nitpicking criticism the next on a similar performance, the employee will simply be confused. Of course the boss may not have any idea that they did any damage. The boss may have spilled coffee on themselves on the way to work, someone may have looked at them the wrong way, or maybe there is trouble at home. Then, they got to work, saw a small error in the employee&rsquo;s performance and &ndash; instead of leading with the positive &ndash; they tell the employee the small thing that was wrong. The boss returns to their work, clueless that damage was just inflicted; the employee returns to his/her desk dejected and baffled.</p><p> Over time, repetitive inconsistent behavior like this on the part of the boss can lead to learned helplessness in the employee. Essentially learned helplessness means the employee once thought of themselves as competent and good at what they do, but because of their boss&rsquo; inconsistent reinforcement, their opinion of themselves degenerates and they&rsquo;ve come to think of themselves as incompetent. This of course can all be avoided by self-awareness.</p><p> Bosses can take a moment when they arrive to work (or whenever necessary) to self-evaluate their mindset, see where there thoughts lay to make sure they don&rsquo;t project their own whimsical emotions on others. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being in a bad mood or giving an employee constructive criticism. What we&rsquo;re after is ensuring that whatever reinforcement we give is constructive and is based on the job done and not an irrelevant fleeting emotion that we brought into the workplace. We&rsquo;re all human, things happen, but we can get better at training our minds, watching them.</p><p> There is a phenomenon called Emotional Contagion that deals specifically with this concentric projection of attitudes and feelings and it is very simple: if you smile and are positive around someone, they will feel good and most likely carry that positivity to the next place they go, which can create a ripple effect. It&rsquo;s pretty amazing when you conceive how powerful a small positive gesture can be. The same ripple effect can of course occur when projecting negativity. Want proof? Take a moment and think about whether you feel good or bad around a positive person and/or negative person. It doesn&rsquo;t take a brain surgeon to figure this one out.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s get scientific for a second. </h3><p> <br/> Sigal Barsade (2002), currently a Professor of Management at The Wharton School, conducted seminal work into the positive and negative effects of the emotional dance that takes place in every group.  For the study, she assigned 94 business school undergraduates to 29 different groups ranging in size from two to four participants, including one ringer (otherwise known as a confederate), an actor from the drama department. Each group would decide how to allocate money from a bonus pool. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, the ringer was instructed by Barsade to act out different mood and energy levels, such as cheerful enthusiasm, serene warmth, hostile irritability and depressed sluggishness. </p><p> Barsarde found that the participants acted differently, depending on the actor&rsquo;s performance. The actor&rsquo;s cheerfulness made the group more cheerful; the actor&rsquo;s anger made the group angrier. Positive emotions created more cooperation; negative emotions increased conflict and decreased cooperative decision-making.</p><p> Barsade observed, &ldquo;People are walking mood inductors, continuously influencing the moods and then the judgments and behaviors of others.&rdquo; The effect occurs in every type of organization, in every industry, and in every large and small work group. </p><p> Consistency creates stability and a stable work environment promotes well-being among workers, both superior and subordinate alike.  It is similar to a family dynamic. It has long been accepted that a stable home is the best home for a child to grow up in. It creates the nurturing backbone for a child to fulfill their potential.  An unstable home can lead to, well, I think we&rsquo;re all aware of the effects of unstable homes. <strong>  The workplace is no different. It&rsquo;s a kind of family. </strong></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 18:52:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 18:52:12.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_nISqT59.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/inconsistent-bossing-a-surefire-way-to-disengage/\", \"post_id\": \"6179\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 18:52:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 18:52:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"inconsistent-bossing-a-surefire-way-to-disengage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6178\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2832\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-12.16.37-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"742\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442601900,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2759,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Too Stressed to Sleep?","link":"too-stressed-to-sleep","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  It is becoming more obvious that stress plays a major role in insomnia. </strong> The development of insomnia is largely determined by how we react to stress&ndash;both psychologically and physically. We all may experience what we refer to as transient insomnia after a stressful event. However, for some of us, stressors such as illness, work schedule changes, and interpersonal conflict can lead to chronic insomnia. The question is&hellip;why?</p><p> <strong>  We know that those most vulnerable to stress-induced insomnia seem to have the poorest coping skills. </strong> They are more likely to ruminate and suffer frequent mental intrusions, especially around bedtime, about the stressful events of their lives. As a result, they present to sleep specialists such as myself with the classic complaint of &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t shut my mind down.&rdquo; This makes it very difficult for them to fall or stay asleep.</p><p> Many of us with chronic insomnia seem to be not only psychologically ill prepared to deal with stress, but physiologically as well. We know that many with chronic insomnia experience an overproduction of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Several studies have demonstrated that those predisposed to stress-induced insomnia have an overactive sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system as well as a hyperactive HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) axis resulting in the overproduction of stress hormones. As a result, sleep is severely impaired and disrupted.</p><p> Even more bothersome is the fact that deep slow wave sleep is known to reduce the levels of these stress hormones and decrease the activity of the HPA axis. Wakefulness, on the other hand, increases its output. Thus, insufficient sleep tends to promote a vicious cycle resulting in ever-increasing levels of sleep-inhibiting stress hormones.</p><p> Finally, add to this the fact that high levels of cortisol can decrease levels of melatonin, a major sleep-promoting neuro hormone, which results in an even poorer environment for sleep onset.</p><p> <strong>  Fifteen percent of Americans suffer from chronic insomnia with a majority experiencing it because of chronic stress. </strong> Therefore, stress coping skills are crucial. First, lifestyle changes needed. Regular daily exercise coupled with the elimination of nicotine and caffeine is a good start. Cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, hypnosis, and in some instances seeing a therapist can help diminish arousal levels and intrusive thoughts. There are also sites online that offer help in coping with stress and insomnia.</p><p> It is important to recognize that your lack of sleep may very likely be related to how you deal with stress. The reason so many insomniacs relapse when they stop taking sleeping pills is that they fail to deal with the underlying problem. That problem is their inability to manage stress. Learn to manage your stress. If you need help, get it. If you do, you are more likely to reap the benefits of uninterrupted deep sleep.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 18:55:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 18:55:11.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_kRhubBD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/too-stressed-to-sleep/\", \"post_id\": \"6181\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 18:55:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 18:55:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"too-stressed-to-sleep\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6180\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2833\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/img-article-are-you-too-stressed-out.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"766\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442602800,"author_id":157,"chart_url":""}

According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://aging.wisc.edu/midus/findings/pdfs/836.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization  </a> </u> , genetic factors predispose individuals to entrepreneurship, but that doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success.</p><p> A study by  <u>  Gallup </u>  assessed 2,500 entrepreneurs and found that highly talented entrepreneurs are three times more likely to build a large business.  But what does it take to be considered highly talented? Below is a list of the most important nine characteristics that every entrepreneur should display. Find out which ones you&rsquo;re born with and which ones you can learn.</p><h3> What You&rsquo;re Born With <br/>  </h3><li> <p>  <strong>   Passion:  </strong>   Although you can develop or deepen your understanding of your industry, you have to love what you do.   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/jeff-bezos-9542209#early-life-and-career\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Jeff Bezos   </a>  </u>   is the perfect example. He left his successful career as a vice president on Wall Street to start a little company called Amazon in his garage. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Resilience:  </strong>   A successful entrepreneur is willing to fail and able to get back up and try again. You have to compete with yourself and others to never give up. Apple forced out   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/steve-jobs-9354805#departure-from-apple\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Steve Jobs   </a>  </u>   in 1985, but he returned in 1997 to change the face and direction of Apple, giving it new life. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Self-motivation:  </strong>   You are either the type of person who waits for everyone else to tell you what to do, or you&rsquo;re the type of person that does whatever needs to be done. Entrepreneurs see the problem and offer a solution. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Creativity:  </strong>   Some individuals can look at a product and creatively see how to improve it; others accept the world as it is. While at Harvard,   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Zuckerberg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Mark Zuckerberg   </a>  </u>   saw a need for an online directory to connect college students. Thus, Facebook was born. </p></li><h3> What You Can Learn <br/>  </h3><li> <p>  <strong>   Future focus:   </strong>  You must learn to be a forward thinker.   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/biography\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Richard Branson   </a>  </u>   constantly expanded Virgin from a recording label to an airline, and even a nonprofit company. Look at your company&rsquo;s potential growth and figure out how you can take it in new and better directions. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Strong leadership:   </strong>  Entrepreneurs can&rsquo;t live in a bubble and complete every task on their own. Delegate work and shift responsibilities to employees who specialize in areas where you might not be particularly strong. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Expertise:   </strong>  Know what you know and know what you don&rsquo;t know. Read research, perform case studies, and constantly learn from your competitors so that you become the most knowledgeable about your industry. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Adaptability:   </strong>  You need to be able to go with the flow, accept change as it happens, work around obstacles, and adopt new technologies and ideas immediately. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Promotion:   </strong>  You have to be the best salesman in your company.   <u>   <a href=\"http://astrumpeople.com/elon-musk-biography/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Elon Musk   </a>  </u>   and Tesla Motors are synonymous. There is nobody more passionate about electric cars and how they can change the world than Musk. </p></li><p> Now what? If you embody the nine characteristics of an entrepreneur, you&rsquo;re well on your way to running a successful company. It&rsquo;s just a matter of constantly reevaluating yourself and your company because you are never done improving.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 19:00:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 19:00:11.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_NqcNSU8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-traits-successful-entrepreneurs-are-born-with-and-4-you-can-learn/\", \"post_id\": \"6183\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 19:00:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 19:00:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-traits-successful-entrepreneurs-are-born-with-and-4-you-can-learn\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6182\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2834\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/branson.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"381\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442605500,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2761,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Is It so Difficult to Successfully Transfer a Business to Insiders?","link":"why-is-it-so-difficult-to-successfully-transfer-a-business-to-insiders","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Last week we looked at the benefits of, or \"good news\" about, transfers to insiders. This week we'll check out the bad news (or challenges) that we face when designing Exit Plans for our clients who want to transfer their businesses to their key employees.</p><p> <strong>  1. Employees Prepared to Put Skin in the Game. </strong>  Asking key employees if they are willing to  personally guarantee  not only the loans necessary purchase shares of ownership and fund ongoing business needs is key to a transfer to insiders. If the answer is no, the buck stops here.</p><p>  BEI Member Greg Banner approaches the issue of employee willingness this way.</p><p> When an owner of a business tells me that he is going to transfer the business to a key employee, the first thing I ask is, \"Have you expressed this desire to that key employee?\" At least half of the time the answer is no. Owners commonly assume that their key employees want to take over the business at some point in time.</p><p> I once was asked to sit in on a meeting with an owner and key employee when the owner asked the employee that question. The employee's response was something like, \"Why would I want to go through and deal with all the headaches you have all the time? I am a simple guy who is happy getting my paycheck and going home at the end of the day without any of that responsibility.\"</p><p> This employee's response is not at all atypical. It is important for you to verify the key employees' willingness to buy a company before traveling down this exit path.  <strong>  Most importantly, if employees are not willing to personally guarantee loans, owners can't pursue this type of exit path without increasing the risk of not getting paid. </strong></p><p> One of the most effective transfer plans requires key employees to obtain bank financing to purchase an owner's remaining ownership after they have gained sufficient experience and have substantial ownership. Banks will require personal guarantees from these key employees. Only at this point (when owners have received the balance of their \"purchase price\" via bank financing) does control of the company transfer to the new owners.</p><p> Before losing control, owners should insist that all debt, leases and bonds that they've signed and guaranteed personally be transferred to key employees.</p><p> Again, if early in the planning process you discover that key employees are unwilling to put their names on the dotted line, it is foolhardy to recommend this exit path.</p><p> <strong>  2. Getting Paid. </strong>  Closely related to the willingness of employees to secure debt, is the risk of not getting paid. This challenge (unlike the first) can be overcome with planning well in advance of the owner's exit date. Key employees typically have little or no money, may be untested in ownership and unproven in ambition. To succeed, good plan design allots adequate time to address all of these concerns.</p><p> <strong>  3. The Business is not Ready to Run Without the Owner.  </strong> Usually, owners begin the transfer process before the future owners are fully able to run the business without the original owner's leadership, expertise and guidance. Businesses must be weaned from dependence on their owners and owners need to be weaned from finding their life's meaning in running their companies.</p><p> <strong>  4. The Owner is Ready to Exit. </strong>  The best transfer designs (those operating under the three guiding principles: minimizing risk, maximizing value and maintaining control until owners receive the cash to achieve financial independence) take time. Think years: five to ten years, on average, from the time owners start to transfer ownership to key employees until they are completely cashed out. Hence, it is imperative that you help the owner initiate a transfer plan  before the owner is ready to exit . Most owners need to stay involved with their businesses for some time before the future owners are prepared to take the reins.</p><p> <strong>  5. New Ownership is Untested. </strong>  Are key employees capable of one day replacing the owner?</p><p> <strong>  6. Cash Flow / Growth is Inconsistent. </strong>  If the company has a history of inconsistent cash flow, it may not be a good candidate for a transfer to an insider&mdash;or any transfer for that matter. Cash flow is an issue that must be addressed and resolved in that part of the Exit Planning process devoted to growing transferable value. The design of a transfer to insiders can require maintaining consistent cash flow as part of the performance standard that must be met in order for the KEG to be able to acquire ownership.</p><p> <strong>  7. I'm Using My Own Money to Buy Myself Out!  </strong> Owners suspect that a transfer to employees is just a way of using their own money to buy themselves out. They are correct, but only if the transfer is not properly planned.</p> ","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-17 19:05:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-17 19:05:00.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_90HIRm8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-successfully-transfer-a-business-to-insiders/\", \"post_id\": \"6185\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-17 19:05:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-17 19:05:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-is-it-so-difficult-to-successfully-transfer-a-business-to-insiders\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6184\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2835\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cold-nature-water-grass-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"353\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442588400,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2762,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Follow The Money: Sniffing Out Hidden Wealth Management Fees","link":"follow-the-money-sniffing-out-hidden-wealth-management-fees","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRudinGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   April Rudin  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.therudingroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Rudin Group  </u> </a></p><p> Financial advisors can be very creative about the fees they charge to clients in the distribution of investment instruments. Do you know what you are paying for? <strong>  Are your advisor's interests aligned with yours? </strong></p><p> Independent family offices and independent advisors generally provide the simplest and most aligned fee arrangements, given that the they charge a flat fee, typically on a quarterly basis.</p><p> But when investment advisors are also product providers or distributors that attempt to combine delivery of products with delivery of advice, fee structures start to get a little bit more complicated. In these arrangements, the purported advisors are typically receiving income, related to their client activity, which stems from a source other than their clients. In this case, it is legitimate to ask whose interests they place first.</p><p> \"Investors should make sure their investment professional is a fiduciary at all times,\" said Knut Rostad, president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard. \"The difference between 'advisers' and 'sellers' in finance is clear. Clients pay fiduciaries - or advisers - to get objective advice. Manufacturers pay product sellers - whether they're selling mutual funds or insurance policies -- to get sales. To mix up the two is like confusing the car dealer with the consumer report on the car dealer.\"</p><h3> 12b-1 Fees</h3><p> <br/> For starters, most retail share classes of mutual funds charge their clients, in addition to asset management and administration fees, 12b-1 fees (the industry term for marketing fees). These are usually subtracted from the value of your fund on a daily basis and periodically remitted to the agent who sold the fund to you. Are these agents recommending the funds that best meet your needs, or those that extract and remit the highest marketing fees? This is something clients need to know.</p><h3> Bond spreads</h3><p> <br/> If your portfolio includes single bonds, many brokers act as principal rather than agent in offering these bonds to you. This means that, rather than shopping the bond markets for the lowest price on your behalf, they will shop on their own behalf, buy the single bonds into their inventory, and sell them at an undisclosed spread to you. It can take a substantial research effort to find out whether the spread they earned can be considered fair based on current market conditions.</p><h3> Soft Dollars</h3><p> <br/> In a \"soft-dollar\" arrangement, a third- party broker that executes stock and bond trades on behalf of an asset manager or advisory firm will offer research services, data subscriptions, or even expensive Bloomberg terminals to its clients, with the understanding that a certain volume of trades will continue to flow in its direction.</p><p> At a minimum, this creates the perception of conflict, with an actual conflict developing if the client firm winds up directing trades to a \"friendly\" trading firm when those same trades could be executed on better conditions with a different third party.</p><h3> Hypothecation</h3><p> \"Hypothecation\" of securities, meanwhile, may be practiced in certain types of brokerage accounts. During the account opening process a client, usually unwittingly, will sign a package of documents that includes a \"hypothecation agreement.\" This means that the broker can, with no additional notification, periodically borrow securities from the client's account and return them at a later date.</p><p> These securities will be loaned to the \"prime brokerage\" side of the broker's business, which will, in turn, lend them to hedge funds, that can then sell them into the market as part of a legitimate \"short selling\" strategy. The conflict in this scenario is that the broker is earning additional fees while taking risk with securities that belong to the client.</p><p> All of these little fees add up and are best avoided by turning to investment advisers, who are looking out for client interests first.</p><p> \"Clients are willing to pay reasonable fees for caring professional advice; but if the fees are hidden, how can they evaluate if they are fair?\" said Michael Warszawski from Manchester Capital Management, a private family office. \"A reference which some of our clients find helpful is the list of 'Best Practices for Objective Financial Advice' published by the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard.\"</p><p> True advisors strive to align their interests with their clients in every aspect of their business practices, including their sources of income, compensation practices, and financial transparency. Financial product providers and distributors play an essential role in our industry. But it is unwise to think of them as impartial advisors, given the complexity and potential conflicts in their sources of income.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 15:02:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 15:02:13.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_vBJX2Lb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/follow-the-money-sniffing-out-hidden-wealth-management-fees/\", \"post_id\": \"6187\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 15:02:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 15:02:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"follow-the-money-sniffing-out-hidden-wealth-management-fees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6186\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2836\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-8.04.57-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"439\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442857500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2763,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Ways to Stop Over-Thinking and Make a Decision","link":"4-ways-to-stop-over-thinking-and-make-a-decision","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m prone to over-thinking, which shows up as ruminating and worrying about things I&rsquo;ve done (or not done) and said (or not said). My tendency to over-think also occasionally shows up when I&rsquo;m trying to make decisions and at times can stop me in my tracks. I spend too much time weighing the options, worrying about what could go wrong, or stalling because I&rsquo;ve not found the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; way forward. It&rsquo;s not always as simple as &ldquo;just decide and move on!&rdquo; Can you relate to any of this? If so, here are four tips for to overcome over-thinking mode and move yourself forward.</p><h3> Align to your values and strengths</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not always necessary or helpful to do this for smaller decisions (when you&rsquo;re in the midst of choosing new dishes, for example). But when deciding on what gets my time, attention, and energy, it is critical that I consider how the situation and the choices align to my core values. The more important or riskier the decision, the more important to me that the choice I make aligns to multiple values and that I leverage one or more character strengths.</p><h3> Get some space</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes as over-thinkers we want to keep working the problem until the solution comes. And sometimes that&rsquo;s the worst thing we can do. When I notice that I am pushing too hard, I&rsquo;ve learned to give myself space and set the decision process aside. I might work on something else for a while, or I&rsquo;ll take a break, read a book, grab a coloring book and some colored pencils, or go for a walk. When I have the luxury, I&rsquo;ll let the decision rest for a few days or a week. When I&rsquo;m really stuck, I leave it alone even longer. With enough time and space, the right answer emerges naturally. Some of my best ideas and resolutions have come when I&rsquo;m walking in nature.</p><h3> Process with others</h3><p> <br/> I tend to process problems in my journal and often see things more clearly after I write everything out. But sometimes after trying this or the other tactics mentioned above, I&rsquo;m still stuck. I am very fortunate to have a very active support network I can turn to when I need help. I&rsquo;ve processed problems with a family member, a dear friend, a trusted colleague, my coach, my accountability partner, and my spiritual director. Sometimes I discuss the same problem with multiple people for two reasons: each time I talk it through, another piece becomes clearer and each person adds their unique perspective. I have experienced both small shifts and major breakthroughs after discussing my challenges with one or more people.</p><h3> Notice your body&rsquo;s response</h3><p> <br/> Recently, I was contemplating making a fairly significant change to the scope of my work. There was one type of service in particular I liked doing less than all others but for a variety of reasons, I was having a hard time deciding to let it go. After contemplating this off and on for nearly a year, the time came when I needed to decide. I brought this up during a session with my coach and she asked me, for the sake of our discussion today, what if you just set that aside? You know it&rsquo;s there, you can come back to it later. But what if for now you just let it go? I noticed immediately that my body felt lighter, my shoulders relaxed, and I felt a wave of positive energy coursing through my body. The next thing I noticed was that it was my mind that had been fighting this decision all along. My brain was trying to drag me back down into the swirl with questions, doubts, and fears. But the message from my body was too loud to ignore: You&rsquo;ll be much happier without it. I decided shortly after that call to let that kind of work go for now, assuring my worried mind that that I can always come back to it again later if I needed to.</p><p> So, fellow over-thinkers, which strategies work best for you? I&rsquo;d love to hear what else you&rsquo;ve done to release the grip of over-thinking, make your decision, and move forward.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 15:08:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 15:08:03.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_LnXjsIr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-ways-to-stop-over-thinking-and-make-a-decision/\", \"post_id\": \"6189\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 15:08:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 15:08:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-ways-to-stop-over-thinking-and-make-a-decision\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6188\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2837\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-8.12.32-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"404\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442835900,"author_id":468,"chart_url":""}

Something like, &ldquo;Yes, please tell her it&rsquo;s about her lead processing, and I&rsquo;ll be happy to hold please.&rdquo;  This will work in most instances.  Once again, you must use the openings as I recommend them to avoid the screening that occurs naturally. </p><p> If you have used both of these openings and still get the objection, <strong>  &ldquo;She only responds to email,&rdquo; </strong> then you can try the following statements which may sometimes work:</p><p> &ldquo;I have emailed in the past, and I think they may be getting stuck in her spam folder.  Could you please tell her I need just a minute to confirm this please?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to email her my information, but I&rsquo;m not sure which brochure to send.

{"original_id":2765,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Stomach of Steel","link":"stomach-of-steel","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A few weeks ago, when the US markets started dropping dramatically, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal called. He asked me if I had received any calls from worried clients. I told him I had heard from 5% of my clients. \"What changes in their portfolios are you making?\" he asked.</p><h3> \"I&rsquo;m not making any changes to my investment strategy.\"</h3><p> <br/> He expressed amazement that I was not \"doing something.\" Most investors and their advisors he was speaking with were making \"adjustments\" to their portfolios. He told me I must have a \"stomach of steel.\"</p><p> Hardly. My gut is certainly not immune to those fearful sinking feelings that go along with market plunges. What I do have is enough experience to trust my long-term investment strategy.</p><p> The time most investors and advisors decide an investment strategy doesn&rsquo;t work is when their portfolios lose value, usually due to a decline in US stocks. This confuses me. Here's why:</p><p> First, I'm confused that so many investors believe it's possible to move in and out of markets in such a way that their portfolios will rarely, if ever, suffer a negative return.</p><h3> This is magical or delusional thinking.</h3><p> <br/> The only investor I&rsquo;m aware of who consistently produced positive returns, year after year, was a fellow by the name of Bernie Madoff. If you have never heard of this investment wizard, he's the one who is now serving a life sentence in a federal prison for propagating a Ponzi scheme that robbed billions of dollars from investors.</p><p> Short-term or moderate-term losses are inevitable in any portfolio that seeks to earn returns above those offered by a bank Certificate of Deposit. Usually, in the long run, markets recover and so does your portfolio.</p><p> Sadly, too many investors turn short-term losses into long-term losses by abandoning their investment strategy when the US markets turn down. This locks in their losses, never to be recovered.</p><p> If your portfolio is widely diversified among many markets&mdash;like bonds, emerging markets, commodities, real estate, TIPs, and various investment strategies&mdash;you will almost always have an asset class losing money. You will also almost always have an asset class making money. If not, you probably don&rsquo;t have a diversified portfolio.</p><h3> Here's the second reason I'm confused.</h3><p> <br/> Most investment strategies assume that the US market will decline, and they have a strategy in place for dealing with those declines. For a buy-and-hold investor, the strategy is to do absolutely nothing. For a strategic asset allocator like myself, it&rsquo;s to rebalance frequently by selling appreciating asset classes and buying into those in decline. By not making changes to clients' portfolios during a market decline, I am not \"doing nothing;\" I am simply continuing to follow an investment strategy.</p><p> Because most of my clients have learned over time to trust this strategy, relatively few of them make panicky calls to my office during downturns. Yet I have noticed a direct correlation between US stock market declines and my daily phone call volume. Many of the calls are from reporters wanting to know what I am doing and am telling clients. My response&mdash;that I'm not doing anything different&mdash;is the same thing I told them when the markets last declined in 2011 and before that in 2009, 2008, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1997, etc.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t the response an anxious client or a concerned reporter wants to hear. When the emotional center of the brain is overcome with panic and fear, taking action helps relieve anxiety. If that short-term action is selling into volatile stock markets, however, it often turns out to be a long-term mistake.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 15:22:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 15:22:41.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ZU88qvf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stomach-of-steel/\", \"post_id\": \"6193\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 15:22:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 15:22:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stomach-of-steel\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6192\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2839\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/train.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1019\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442851200,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

Want to travel more? Sometimes it&rsquo;s not all fun and excitement, but here are 7 ways you can put the adventure back into your business travel!Let me be clear. I have the travel bug. I caught it as a young girl, travelling with my parents around Australia in a caravan every time my Dad had long service leave or school holidays.  For that I am truly grateful.Then as a teen, I was lucky (I mean REALLY lucky) to be awarded a life-changing exchange to Alberta, Canada with Rotary.That was the start of a true journey for me&hellip; Forever bitten by the travel bug.  Since then I have experienced over 30 countries around the world.But since having kids my priorities have changed. I now want them to see the world, and that has been our priority for the past two years as I get asked to speak at more and more amazing conferences and my business takes me around Australia and beyond our shores.In that time, I have picked up a trick or two for making travel fun and I want to share them with you.</p><h3> When travel loses its shine</h3>There&rsquo;s no denying it. Travel for business to amazing places sounds exotic, but sometimes it can be tiring, and it does take you out of your daily routine and away from family. My biggest challenges are:<li> jet lag and recovery time on arrival and return (I live in Australia so it&rsquo;s not so easy to just do a short flight to a city in the States or Europe!).</li><li> missing my family &ndash; time away from them can be a chance to reboot but if you are heading to a busy conference, it doesn&rsquo;t always happen!  We try to all go together to some destinations, but it can be expensive.</li><li> keeping a workflow &ndash; I always have great intentions to keep working, but my travel bug kicks in and I want to see places and hang out with great people.  It&rsquo;s tricky!</li><li> eating well and getting exercise when away!  Finding healthy food can be a challenge in some locations!</li>So here are some solutions to these problems. I hope you find them useful too!<h3> #1  Travel for Business, Plan for an Adventure</h3>I know you might be heading to a conference or a business meeting, but it doesn&rsquo;t all have to be business. Plan for adventure.  I always try to fit in one exciting trip, tour, or &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; on every trip. It&rsquo;s better when I have my family with me, but you can still include awesome people no matter the circumstance or location:<li> Do a shout out on social media for a meet up &ndash; I can guarantee you will know some awesome people online, if you don&rsquo;t know anyone in the city.</li><li> Stay at AirBnB.   <u>  <a href=\"http://airbnb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AirBnB  </a> </u>  is an awesome service that focuses on social proof and recommendations and you get to meet and know the hosts.  It&rsquo;s social and as an ex exchange student, I love that!  My recent stay in San Diego in a gorgeous apartment by the beach before speaking at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/smmworld/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Media Marketing World  </a> </u>   <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thetravelclique/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  was </a> amazing. The host even took me to get a mobile sim card on the first day when I was at my most jet-lagged. How awesome is that!</li> <img alt=\"airbnb\" src=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/wp-content/uploads/airbnb.jpg\"/> <li> Get on  <u>  <a href=\"http://tripadvisor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Trip Advisor  </a> </u>  and find some great restaurants, cafes or attractions and tours before you go. I can guarantee having something planned or booked to look forward to, takes the stress out of it being all work, work work and long haul flights!</li><li> Use Trip Advisor or Google to find and plan for healthy eating. I always look up my local WholeFoods in the States, or local markets and organic grocery stores and juice bars!</li><li> Join your preferred airline club if you can &ndash; it helps to have a comfy place to hang out while waiting for flights and a bite to eat or a drink.</li><h3> And most importantly, say Yes.</h3>Now, I appreciate that not every opportunity that comes your way is a good one (and you also need to exert caution and be safe) but I have found, over many years, that travel opportunities arise that you have to say yes to!On a trip to Cuba, my husband and I met a young man, and after a conversation, he invited us to meet the drummer from Buena Vista Social Club. We said yes, knowing it could be risky (and may well be a wild goose chase) but then again, it was one of <u> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Buena-Vista-Social-Club-Cooder/dp/B000005J56/ref=ntt_mus_dp_dpt_3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  my favourite albums of all time </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgaja-e__2w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I loved the movie </a></u> and&hellip;fun fact&hellip;I play the drums.One hour later we were sitting in a very small apartment having a beer with a Grammy Award Winner speaking in my (very rusty) Spanish, while his Grammy Award sat hanging above our heads. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.Your adventure might not be to meet <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqm8_6ul8hg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Amadito Valdez </a></u> from the Buena Vista Social Club but I can guarantee you will find an adventure in any location.<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qgaja-e__2w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-9.06.18-AM.png\" width=\"849\"/></a>click to view<h3> #2  Get Your Rays &hellip;STAT!</h3>My husband is a health professional, and he told me this awesome secret a couple of years ago when we arrived in San Francisco, with our kids in tow and they were struggling after a long haul flight overnight.  He said this:&ldquo;Quick it&rsquo;s sunny outside, let&rsquo;s go and lay in the park&rdquo;.What? I need to get to the hotel. Let&rsquo;s get settled, I do NOT want to lay in a park in a strange city.&ldquo;We need rays on our forehead&rdquo; he replied.  hmmmmm ok&hellip;. and why?Here&rsquo;s why: our bodies go into &ldquo;what the&hellip;?&rdquo; mode after a long haul flight. We have crossed date lines, sometimes we have arrived (6am LA time) before we left (7am Sydney time) and we are out of kilter. Our circadian rhythm is out of whack.Your circadian rhythm is a physical, mental and chemical rhythm that your body adheres to over a 24 hour cycle.  You can get all the artificial light you want but REAL sun on your forehead helps your body to recognise that it is daytime at your new location.I can&rsquo;t stress this enough. This works wonders. Every time I have been able to get my forehead facing natural sun for some rays, it has helped me to recover from jet lag faster.I&rsquo;m not a health expert, and I don&rsquo;t advocate you stay out there for hours (I said circadian, not lobster) so don&rsquo;t get sunburnt. Even 15 minutes will help. And do it on the day you arrive if it&rsquo;s sunny.So there we were, all laying in a park in San Francisco, sunning ourselves. And I have been telling travellers ever since to sun themselves&hellip; and now I am telling you.Sun + forehead. Stat&hellip;. you&rsquo;ll be ready for your adventure!<h3> #3  Take a personal Tourguide (in your pocket)</h3>Don&rsquo;t have anyone to take you around and show you the sights? Yes you do!  There is no excuse now as we have sooo many apps and guides on our smart phones that we can easily tap in to!My favourite is <u> <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Trip Advisor </a></u>.  Just load the app on to your phone, open it up and click on Near Me Now&hellip;  You can immediately check out hotels, restaurants, cafes, attractions and more!Or use it before you leave to research your destination.  Work out what you want to see and where you would like to go before you leave.  It takes the stress out of finding great meals and getting your way around a city when you arrive.<a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Trip-Advisor\" src=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Trip-Advisor.jpg\"/></a>And I want to give a shout out about another awesome app for those of you coming to Queensland, Australia, my home state.  I was speaking at the <u> <a href=\"http://sometourism.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Social Media Tourism Symposium </a></u> on the Sunshine Coast 2 weeks ago and had the pleasure of hearing Chris Chambers (Director of Digital Marketing, Tourism and Events, Queensland) talk about this amazing app:   <u> <a href=\"http://www.queensland.com/Plan-Your-Trip/Travel-Tools/The-Queensland-App-Store\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  This is Queensland App </a></u> turns a trip to Queensland into an adventure.You can download it on the<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id933688368\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  iTunes store here </u></a> and<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.tq.connect\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  Android here </u></a>.<img alt=\"queensland\" src=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/wp-content/uploads/queensland.jpg\"/>The app helps you to find local visitor information centres in Queensland, WiFi and this bit I love&hellip; it helps you discover local secrets!  Isn&rsquo;t that what travel is all about?  I&rsquo;m excited to use it and I LIVE here!A hard-working business trip with an app like this in your hand can really turn your journey around into something special.So find the app that is used in the local area you are going to &ndash; do a google search for local attractions and destination organisations &ndash; see if they have one.  Even if it is just for an afternoon after you are finished at a conference, getting out and about can feel like an adventure!<h3> #4   Fly like a Rockstar</h3>Flights can be hard. Especially if you have kids in tow, or you are just tired and can&rsquo;t sleep well.  This may not be an &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo; thing, but you are on your way to your destination and you want to be arriving as fresh as possible, so you can have an adventure when there.Here are a few tips that help me to stay fresh and ready to go (as long as I get my rays &ndash; see tip 1) when I arrive:<li> <strong>  Take an awesome neck pillow. </strong>  I have a memory foam one. Trust me, if you get caught sleeping in a strange neck position it can put your body out of kilter and you can get sick.  Try to sleep with a neck pillow on as it keeps your neck in a safer position.</li><li> <strong>  Drink LOADS of water.  </strong>  I know that the rum and coke at 12pm (in whatever time zone you are in) seems like a GREAT idea but go easy on the booze and drink the water&hellip; you will be glad you did.</li><li> <strong>  Take lip balm &ndash; airplanes are VERY dry. </strong></li><li> <strong>  If you have allergies don&rsquo;t trust the food service, take some food with you </strong> &hellip; at least you will be better able to resist having that gluten snack at midnight when you know it will cause your belly to react the next day.</li><li> <strong>  Take regular walks around the plane. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ask for the seat you prefer on check in (aisle or window).  </strong> It might come down to whether you like clambering over people or whether you prefer them clambering over you.</li><li> <strong>  Say hi to the attendants, they are the ones that can sneak you spare snacks or make sure you have the right meal. </strong> If you have kids in tow this is crucial. Make friends.</li><li> <strong>  Bring entertainment.  </strong>  Don&rsquo;t rely on the movies. You might be the one poor person for whom the headset doesn&rsquo;t work or the TV is down. Bring an ipad with some pre-loaded movies or your laptop.  Most planes have chargers now.</li><li> <strong>  Check ahead about in-flight wifi  </strong> &ndash; sometimes you need to download the airline&rsquo;s app and you don&rsquo;t want to be attempting to do it on the runway.</li><li> <strong>  Dress comfortably </strong> &ndash; I know that you want to look good at the airport but here&rsquo;s the thing. Planes are hot around take off and then they get really cold. Dress with layers and make sure you use their pillows and rugs.  Take sneakers or comfy shoes.  And for the love of flying, please ensure you have a change of clothes and some essentials in your carry on &ndash; in case baggage goes missing.</li><li> <strong>  Pack Great headphones. </strong>  Noise cancelling if you can.  And include a set with an adaptor so you can plug it into your arm rest on the plane and watch the movies with awesome sound!</li><li> <strong>  Take many portable chargers. </strong>  I love my Mophie charger but there are many available. I have one that charges a couple of phones and an ipad and one that is a lipstick size charger. You can never have too many chargers.</li><u> <a href=\"http://trunkster.refr.cc/PNFM9G2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  oh and check out these guys </a></u> &ndash; Best. Luggage.

I know I do!  <u> <a href=\"http://trunkster.refr.cc/PNFM9G2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  You can now buy a Trunkster suitcase </a></u> after their successful kickstarter campaign.If you do all these things and still don&rsquo;t have a great flight, then win the lottery and fly business/first class. That&rsquo;s the bomb (just don&rsquo;t say bomb at the airport, ok?  That doesn&rsquo;t end well).<h3> #5  Do Jet Lag like a Resort Guest</h3>I&rsquo;m getting older. I can&rsquo;t backpack like I used to (ah the days of backpacking) and I don&rsquo;t recover from long haul flights as quickly as I used to.So I had to face facts. I need me some jet lag days.What&rsquo;s a jet lag day? It&rsquo;s a day either side, where you just &hellip; jet lag.You take it easy, relax, maybe take a stroll, check out the local area, but don&rsquo;t do too much.  Sleep at the sleep times in your location (avoid sleeping during the day) and eat well. That&rsquo;s it!Now when I travel, I allow for at least one jet lag day on arrival, and one when I get back. It&rsquo;s tricky if you are busy but believe me it&rsquo;s better than having the effects of jet lag to cope with over a full week.You will recover quicker grasshopper. And remember&hellip;. Rays + forehead. Refer to Tip #1.<h3> #6  Become a Day Stay-er</h3>I&rsquo;ve discovered the day stay and I love it. Often we get so caught up in all of our transfers and getting from A to B and it sometimes involves a LOT of waiting.Why wait somewhere unappealing?  I&rsquo;ve been caught out trying to work at LAX before waiting for a flight that afternoon after arriving early morning &hellip; and it&rsquo;s just not fun.  Book a day stay!You can do this in an airline lounge and lucky you if you are a member of an airline club. Do that.If not then check out options for a day stay before you arrive. Some airlines offer a day stay rate. Believe me if you are stuck in an airport all day, paying $50 (sometimes between $50 and $80) might be a very very good investment for your sanity.Or check out the local hotels &ndash; some of them offer day room rates. You can hang out in a hotel room, watch TV, use the gym, sauna, spa, pool and just relax &hellip; better than the airport!  And usually they are close by so it&rsquo;s just a quick shuttle bus down to the international airport!<h3> #7  Meet in the Middle</h3>I used to love travelling alone. After travelling in Europe with friends (pre-kids) and always having a deadline to meet or a destination we needed to be at for one of our party members, I revelled in spending 5 months in South America having NO agenda.Truth be known I didn&rsquo;t spend long alone as I ended up meeting great friends to travel with &ndash; but at least it was my choice and I loved having the freedom to travel.Now that I am older and have awesome little people in my family I want to travel with them. There is nothing like the wide eyed wonder of a child&rsquo;s experiences travelling&hellip; so I love to have my family with me when I can.So I have come up with a compromise. We can&rsquo;t always afford for our whole family to go to the States or wherever I am flying&hellip; so we &ldquo;meet in the middle&rdquo;. Fiji and Hawaii have been our test cases so far and I can tell you that it is the BEST holiday ever.<img alt=\"No, not Jurassic World, but Kauai, Hawaii. Where we met in the middle. \" src=\"http://sociallysorted.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Kauai-coastline.jpg\"/>No, not Jurassic World, but Kauai, Hawaii. Where we met in the middle.Not only does the business traveller get &ldquo;half jet lag&rdquo; in that you are only flying half way so it&rsquo;s not so hard on your body&hellip; but my family are super excited for the entire time I am away to come and meet me. Winning!And if it&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch to all meet in the middle, then consider just having a stopover. This also works for those that are really not sure about long haul flights (we Aussies get used to it but we have to &hellip; we live so far from anywhere).If you are flying from the States to Australia a stopover in Hawaii could be fun, or from Europe to Australia, stop in Asia. It breaks up your trip, so if you have the time, do it!","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 16:09:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 16:09:48.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_F1ue2vS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-ways-to-put-adventure-back-into-your-business-travel/\", \"post_id\": \"6197\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 16:09:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 16:09:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-ways-to-put-adventure-back-into-your-business-travel\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6194\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2840\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-9.19.15-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"763\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442844000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2767,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Reasons Relationships Don't Drive YOUR Revenue","link":"3-reasons-relationships-dont-drive-your-revenue","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackKosakowski1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jack Kosakowski  </u> </a></p><p> There is a lot of talk about relationships being the reason that people buy.  I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this quite a bit lately and I&rsquo;ve battled with this &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; for a while now.  One day I believe that relationships are the key driving factor and then I flip-flop a day later.   <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackKosakowski1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   My lightbulb  </a> </u>  went off today and therefore you are getting this piece of content with my epiphany of awesomeness!</p><h3> All Sales Reps Have Relationships&hellip; But Most Have &ldquo;NO&rdquo; Revenue!</h3><p> <br/> In  <u>  my twelve years as sales pro </u>  I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of other sales reps &hellip; come and go!  There was one common denominator that every sales rep I&rsquo;ve worked with had; they all prized &ldquo;RELATIONSHIPS.&rdquo;  Most reps go sales job to sales job and have built relationships along the way. It&rsquo;s pretty common that a sales rep pitches the clients they have &ldquo;closed&rdquo; at their previous job along with friends they have, or family members that relate to the current product they are trying to sell. The issue is that 20% of sales reps do 80% of the revenue. Does that mean that these 20% of the sales reps have 80% of the relationships as well?  Well &hellip; I highly doubt that.</p><h3> Relationships Influence &amp; Strengthen Sales Only</h3><p> <br/> How many relationships do you have right now, as a sales professional, who could and should buy your product? How many of those people have you had the conversation with and have converted to revenue?I&rsquo;d say that number is pretty low unless you have been selling the same product for a really long time. Now, with that being said I truly believe that you have to build relationships now,&hellip; so you can plan for the future when your buyer is ready to buy. Your relationships are important because once you&rsquo;ve built the right relationships, the right way, you now have the influence needed to strengthen the business relationship purchase of your buyer. </p><h3> People Buy from People When&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The old saying that &ldquo;people buy from people,&rdquo; is somewhat comical to me.  OF COURSE &ldquo;people buy from people.&rdquo; All you need is a little common sense to understand that, or all the other sales jargon that we read about. The truth of the matter is &ldquo;People buy from people WHEN they have a business problem that they need fixed, and people only buy from people at the right time they need to fix it. You might have had a lucky deal or two where someone bought out of character because of your relationship but there is no way that your company (or you) can survive off of that.</p><h3> Start Building The Right Relationships Now&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Now, with the three points that I just talked about&hellip; Don&rsquo;t go and try to twist my words saying that I don&rsquo;t think relationships are important.  I&rsquo;m the king of relationships if you know me.  I&rsquo;d say I love making new relationships more than Donald Trump loves his toupee.</p><h3> In Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> The upshot is, there has to be a business need. That&rsquo;s what drives the sale. If you start thinking of relationships as the trigger that makes the decision swing in your favor and not the silver bullet, it will strengthen your sales career.  You have to be patient, solve business problems through education first, solving a problem second, waiting for the buyer to have their moment of &ldquo;aha,&rdquo; and be there along the way to influence their decision at the right time.  Plan now so that your pipeline is full of great business conversations and relationships that are just waiting for their &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment after you set the trigger and wait for it to click!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 16:33:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 16:33:55.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_p905FgY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-reasons-relationships-dont-drive-your-revenue/\", \"post_id\": \"6199\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 16:33:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 16:33:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-reasons-relationships-dont-drive-your-revenue\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6198\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2841\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-9.38.39-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"444\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442833200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2768,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Biggest Challenge Facing Owner-Run Companies","link":"the-biggest-challenge-facing-owner-run-companies","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  &ldquo;What do you mean I&rsquo;m off-brand? I&rsquo;m the founder&rdquo;. </strong> This was the provocative title of an  <u>  <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/small-agency-diary/brand-founder/300301/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article in AdAge  </a> </u>  recently. Bemoaning an &ldquo;undercurrent of anxiety&rdquo; at her digital marketing agency, founder Nina Hale shared how after 10 years of growing the company, she is running into daily interactions where she feels she is either no longer in control of the company she founded or she is being asked to do things by employees for &ldquo;the brand&rdquo; that seem at odds with her role or incongruent with the way she has grown the agency to date. In her own words: &ldquo;Basically, I&rsquo;m off-brand. How did this happen? I founded this agency; it&rsquo;s named after me. I thought I was the brand.&rdquo;</p><p> What Nina is discovering is what many founders experience when their companies reach a certain size.</p><h3> The company has become bigger than any one individual.</h3><p> <br/> It no longer exists to serve the needs of the founder alone nor can it grow if every decision needs to be made by the person with the name over the door. Founders who reach this stage are faced with making one of two possible decisions: Grow the company to the ceiling of the abilities of the founder or grow beyond the individual(s) to satisfy a greater need. The question becomes personality or purpose?</p><p> Aside from the usual exceptions to any rule, companies looking to scale dramatically need to become purpose-driven companies rather than personality-driven companies. Don&rsquo;t all companies have a purpose? and aren&rsquo;t all companies personality-driven?</p><p> It may seem this way, but there are clear differences between both types of enterprise. A purpose-driven company has made a decision to take a long-term view for the business, choosing to only pursue profit if it can benefit all stakeholders (employees, customers, community, planet) along the way. Purpose-driven companies have chosen to solve a particular societal need greater than any one individual&rsquo;s needs. Decision making can happen at any level of the organization due to the clarity of the vision and purpose. Marketing related costs tend to be lower at purpose-driven companies, who instead favor grass-roots community building efforts that earn trust, loyalty and opportunities to connect meaningfully with stakeholders. Purpose-driven companies aren&rsquo;t dependent on who occupies the CEO office to achieve their goals, instead employees move as a single unit towards the clear goals.</p><p> Personality-driven companies that reach a certain stage of growth depend on the individual founder for most of the decision making, often resulting in slower decisions. Executives and team members are often unclear what decisions to make themselves as they may be at odds with what the founder&rsquo;s goals are. Personality-led companies may be successful, but often only as long as the founder remains committed to growth and development of the company.</p><h3> This brings its own challenges.</h3><p> <br/> A founder taking something as simple as a vacation may cause operations to come to a standstill or for deals to wait until (s)he returns. Personality-driven companies tend to have a more political environment than purpose-driven companies with employees angling to be &ldquo;anointed&rdquo; by the leader or in favor.</p><p> The question becomes what company you want to be part of? Are you comfortable with your company becoming bigger than you? If so, are you willing to allow decisions to be made in your absence as long as they are in line with the purpose of the company? If not, you may be more comfortable operating to the ceiling of your own personality. There is no right or wrong answer as it depends on the goals of the founder as to what type of company is being built. Whichever decision you make, can you answer the following question? <strong>  What is the purpose of the company? Why does it really exist? Answer this and it will be easier to decide which type of company is the best fit for you. </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 16:57:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 16:57:26.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_2QkMnUA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-biggest-challenge-facing-owner-run-companies/\", \"post_id\": \"6201\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 16:57:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 16:57:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-biggest-challenge-facing-owner-run-companies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6200\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2842\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442570468985-f63ed5de9086-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"646\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442838600,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}

With an overall surge in automation across the entire service sector, it&rsquo;s surprising that the technology for a rules-based advisor platform didn&rsquo;t pop up sooner. There are self-checkout lines in every grocery store and Home Depot, iPads replacing waiters and waitresses, and those dreaded customer service answering services (hint: just keep mashing &ldquo;0&rdquo; until you get a human).Up until recently, however, automation hasn&rsquo;t crept into &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; jobs, such as financial advisement. But for the <u> <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/09/more-millionaires-than-ever-are-living-in-the-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">  97 percent </a></u> of Americans that aren&rsquo;t millionaires, complex financial planning probably isn&rsquo;t necessary. The plan is pretty simple: pay down your highest debts first, build emergency savings, and save for retirement/college/a house/etc.<h3> So why shouldn&rsquo;t there be a simple, cost efficient means for the masses to access financial advice?</h3>Easy for me to say; I&rsquo;m not the one whose livelihood depends on people coming to me for financial advice. Instead, I write about financial topics and provide sources to reporters that also write about finance. No robot is going to be able to take that job from me, right?A few months ago, I heard <u> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a segment on NPR </a></u> covering new software called &ldquo;Wordsmith&rdquo;, invented by <u> <a href=\"http://automatedinsights.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Automated Insights </a></u>, which can automatically write articles in a fraction of a second. What!? Automated reporting? A little over a year ago, The Associated Press announced it would use this software to generate stories about earnings reports from publicly traded companies. The AP then expanded their use to include college sports reporting. Right now, the news service&rsquo;s use of Wordsmith is focused on areas that are statistic based and formulaic, but that could change in the future to include a broader base of topics.Algorithmic reporting is actually very wide spread. Automated Insights claims to have generated one billion articles in 2014. As a public relations professional and someone who does quite a bit of financial writing for a living, this hit close to home. I can&rsquo;t exactly foster a relationship with &ndash; or offer sources to &ndash; an algorithm that crunches news and data in a fraction of a second. Is this the beginning of the end for reporters and PR professionals?Let&rsquo;s take a step back and look at the big picture. Automation in the service sector is inevitable. It&rsquo;s the result of a long history of humanity&rsquo;s never-ending quest to achieve a better standard of living through efficiency. If companies drive down costs by producing goods more efficiently, those goods become more widely available to the masses. That same logic applies to the service industry. It started with low-skill jobs and has slowly crept its way up to white collar jobs.There are many examples of mass production and automation throughout history, but things really got cooking during the Industrial Revolution, when machines started rapidly taking over many human jobs. The classic example is the 19th-century English textile workers called Luddites, who lost their jobs to machines that needed only a few workers to quickly and cheaply produce more cloth. In retaliation, many Luddites began destroying factories and machinery. They feared technological innovation.As was the case with the Industrial Revolution, each successive wave of new automation brings with it a fresh round of dialogue, as people worry about machines taking their jobs. But automation has never made us obsolete. In the face of being taken over by machines, we&rsquo;ve adapted, progressed, and avoided any kind of secular trend in increasing unemployment.Fortunately, there&rsquo;s only so much algorithmic reporting software can do. There will always be a need for reporters to provide insights and in-depth reporting. And as financial services PR professionals, we&rsquo;re the link that provides those reporters expert commentary from actual humans. For now, I feel that we&rsquo;re safe. I&rsquo;ll just cross my fingers that Google and Apple hold back from developing a <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\" target=\"_blank\">  technological singularity </a></u>.Some financial advisors, on the other hand, will need to do more to adapt to encroaching robo-advisors. Here are a few tips:<li> <strong>  Build meaningful relationships with your clients. </strong>  Take advantage of the human element. Meet with clients face to face and learn their goals and aspirations. Address their fears. Provide them hope. Win the trust that a computer can&rsquo;t.</li><li> <strong>  Meet the progeny. Make connections with your clients&rsquo; children. </strong> After all, they&rsquo;re the ones that will be inheriting  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150713/FEATURE/150719999/the-great-wealth-transfer-is-coming-putting-advisers-at-risk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $30 trillion in assets over the next 30 years  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Use social media.

{"original_id":2770,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"11 Do's And Don'ts Of Providing Effective Feedback","link":"11-dos-and-donts-of-providing-effective-feedback","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Jillian Petrova</p><p> Employees require effective feedback in order to deliver their best at work, and it is up to their managers to provide them a productive feedback. But what exactly is &ldquo;effective&rdquo; feedback and how can a manager be effective in his or her feedback? Read on to know more about how you as a manager can provide your employees with feedback that will help them deliver their utmost at the workplace.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t: Exaggerate </strong> <br/> Avoid the use of the words &ldquo;always&rdquo; and &ldquo;never&rdquo; as these will only antagonize your subordinates and not make them receptive to what you have to say to them.</p><p> <strong>  Do: Be Timely </strong> <br/> The best feedback is a feedback that is delivered quickly. If you take your sweet time about delivering the feedback, your subordinate may not recall the exact details of the event that took place, rendering the feedback irrelevant.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t: Resort To Personal Attacks </strong> <br/> Point out what the employee could have done better, but refrain from attacking the employee personally. Instead of telling your employee he or she is &ldquo;foolish&rdquo;, limit yourself to the mistake he or she made, as a personal attack does not provide actionable items for correction.</p><p> <strong>  Do: Be Specific </strong> <br/> Give precise details of what went right and what went wrong so that your subordinate knows what exactly is expected of him or her the next time around. Let them clearly know what they need to avoid and why while performing certain tasks.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t: Save Your Feedback Until The Annual Appraisal </strong> <br/> Keep giving feedback throughout the evaluation period to nip undesirable behaviors in the bud before they escalate into major performance issues by the time of the appraisal.</p><p> <strong>  Do: Be Sensitive </strong> <br/> Always keep the  <a href=\"http://www.yourerc.com/blog/post/When-Work-Gets-Personal-Managing-Emotional-Employees.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  emotional needs of your employee </a>  into account.  Avoid negative feedback when the employee seems to be going through a rough personal patch. Treat all your employees as human beings, and give them the space and kind words they need at their time of distress.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t: Criticize Things Which Are Beyond Your Employee&rsquo;s Control </strong> <br/> There is no point criticizing an employee for his stuttering habit because he has no control over it. Don&rsquo;t assign him things that he isn&rsquo;t skilled enough to do, and then expect a good result out of it. For instance, if the employee is specialized in blog writing, you can&rsquo;t expect him to do an academic coursework that <a href=\"http://www.courseworkspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  expert coursework writers &ndash; Coursework Spot </a>  for instance &ndash; are expected to do. Regardless, not only it is rude to make fun of or target such a problem but it would also negatively affect your impression at the workplace.</p><p> <strong>  Do: Keep It Interactive </strong> <br/> Request your employee to provide his or her own opinions and ask questions along the way. It would keep him interested and in the loop at all times.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t: Threaten Your Employee </strong> <br/> A cornered employee will react and it will not be pleasant at any given time. Remember, it is always give and take when it comes to  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2013/07/22/5-ways-leaders-earn-respect-from-their-employees/\" target=\"_blank\">  professional respect and trust </a> . Maintain your employee&rsquo;s respect and dignity at all times so that you get the same in return.</p><p> <strong>  Do: Point Out What You Want To Be Changed </strong> <br/> Instead of criticizing and pointing out mistakes, point out what your employee can do better and what he or she needs to do instead.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t: Assume Your Subordinate Is Wrong </strong> <br/> Yes, you may have gathered all the data that you possibly could before giving feedback but this does not mean that you are right and your employee is wrong. There are always two sides to the story, and perhaps he or she may have a good justification for doing what they did. Be open to all kinds of possibilities and listen to them before jumping to any conclusion.</p><p> Remember, the best feedback is the one that brings about a positive change and results in the desired outcome. These tips may help you get the outcomes that you want with as little conflict as possible.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 17:15:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 17:15:49.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_yWdoYdb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/11-dos-and-donts-of-providing-effective-feedback/\", \"post_id\": \"6205\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 17:15:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 17:15:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"11-dos-and-donts-of-providing-effective-feedback\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6204\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2844\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-10.19.12-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2488\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442862900,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

But in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;immediate gratification&rsquo;, &lsquo;I need it NOW&rsquo; culture, the idea of cultivating patience might be worth more than a cursory glance.</p><p> The pressure for leaders to deliver in the short-term can be uber-present at the very least &ndash; and at worst, overwhelming. This short-term, outcome-focused approach is well known in business. And it is acutely felt by many of the leaders I coach.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no wonder that the systemically accepted pressure to achieve stellar results by &lsquo;yesterday&rsquo; turns us into action-oriented, ants-in-our-pants, finger-tapping managers.</p><p> We become results-oriented at the expense of other equally valid leadership traits &ndash; such as compassion or seeking to understand &ndash; expecting immediate and significant progress in everything from performance improvement to product launches to post-merger integration.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s not just others we get impatient with. Often it&rsquo;s ourselves who bear the brunt of this pesky impatience gene. A very talented senior leader I coach recently berated himself for not  having &ldquo;turned around&rdquo; the division he led yet. It was only when I reminded him that he had only been in the role for six months and that expecting a complete turnaround in performance  of an entire business unit in that time might be just a tad unrealistic, did he sheepishly admit he might be letting his impatience get the better of him.</p><p> Skilled leadership means getting the balance right.</p><p> Between delivery and progress.</p><p> Between concrete outcomes and seeing what emerges.</p><p> Between being hungry for improvement and valuing what progress has been made so far.</p><p> Between applying pressure and stepping back.</p><p> In short, great leaders demonstrate patience.</p><p> Change (especially behavioural) is hard.</p><p> <strong>  Be patient. </strong></p><p> Customers don&rsquo;t always act like you want them to.</p><p> <strong>  Be patient. </strong></p><p> Others are generally trying the best they can, with what they have.</p><p> <strong>  Be patient. </strong></p><p> Not quite where you want to be with your own journey, whatever that is?</p><p> <strong>  Be patient.  </strong></p><p> Cultivate this quiet but powerful leadership trait. Invite patience and its close friends &ndash;  <u>  persistence </u>  and  <u>  compassion </u>  &ndash; to join your &lsquo;impatience party&rsquo;. Look to nature for inspiration &ndash; the seasons won&rsquo;t hurry for anyone!</p><p> The epilogue to my impatient-laden week?

If your family has substantial  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   assets  </a> </u> , your child might already own valuable physical possessions at the age of 18. For example &mdash; cars, collections, artwork, heirlooms &mdash; even beloved pets. If it&rsquo;s important to your child that he or she be able to dictate the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/dictionary/disposition-term.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   disposition  </a> </u>  of these items, then a will is essential. <strong>  Second </strong> , your child may be left a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trust  </a> </u>  or other assets by grandparents, great uncles, great aunts, etc. The disposition of these assets should be a consideration in any young person&rsquo;s estate plan.</p><p> <strong>  Next we have the practical reasons. </strong> While it&rsquo;s a somewhat morbid consideration, particularly for a young adult,  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   estate planning  </u>    </a> is in some ways about planning for the unfortunate side of life. A young person&rsquo;s passing is no less complicated from a legal perspective than that of an adult. Hours of time and substantial sums of money might have to be expended if a teenager dies  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intestate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   intestate  </a> </u> . This can serve only to add more stress and discomfort to a family that is already grieving. There have also been instances where several family members pass in a tragic accident and a single sibling is left behind. That sibling will almost certainly be an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heir.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   heir  </a> </u>  to the deceased siblings, and absent the deceased siblings having wills, the survivor will face unnecessary legal issues.</p><p> <strong>  Finally we have the life-lesson reasons. </strong> Part of being a financially responsible adult is maintaining an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/university/estate-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   effective and timely estate plan  </a> </u> . The earlier a young adult becomes familiar with the concept of estate planning, the more likely he or she is to maintain an up-to-date plan in later years. Fortunately, this makes talking to teenagers about an estate plan a bit easier. They usually perceive it as an opportunity to stretch their new adult wings and exercise adult responsibility. This is a good time to let your child think about what he or she wants rather than what you might think is best.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 18:41:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 18:41:20.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_BiIXwRu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/teenage-will-power/\", \"post_id\": \"6211\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 18:41:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 18:41:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"teenage-will-power\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6210\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2847\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-11.50.58-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"358\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442862000,"author_id":11,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2774,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Is Technology Changing Management?","link":"how-is-technology-changing-management","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The basics of management haven&rsquo;t changed with time,  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/07/managers-are-more-connected-but-to-all-the-wrong-things\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   notes Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> ; it remains more art than science. Styles and subject matter may evolve, but basic management practice endures. Managing is action-oriented, fast-paced and rife with pressure. Managers are interrupted often and typically don&rsquo;t have the luxury of long periods of concentration.</p><p> Indeed, managers have always led hectic lives. It seems someone needs something from them at every moment of the day. With the advent of the Internet, managers&rsquo; time has become even more scarce as technology blurs the lines between the professional and the private, as  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.howstuffworks.com/technology-changed-business.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HowStuffWorks notes  </a> </u> .</p><p> But technology also has simplified life for managers in many ways. Information is much easier to access from the cloud than from file drawers back at the office, and email allows instant communication to every corner of the globe. Is technology changing management for the better? To answer that question, it&rsquo;s necessary to examine the pros and cons.</p><h3> Con: Less time for human contact</h3><p> <br/> Staring at a screen and typing means less time for face-to-face interaction with other people, as  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/07/managers-are-more-connected-but-to-all-the-wrong-things\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review notes  </a> </u> . Managers &mdash; who historically have done their jobs primarily by walking around and talking to people &mdash; only have so many hours in each day. Text-based methods of communication like email provide ample room for misinterpretation and misunderstanding, which certainly can impede managers from doing their jobs effectively.</p><p> A perpetually clogged email inbox is bound to serve as a stumbling block to real human interaction &mdash; especially when the expectation is that managers respond to emails and texts instantaneously.</p><h3> Pro: Ease of keeping in touch with external networks</h3><p> <br/> A manager&rsquo;s life can be a lonely one, especially when it seems no one in the company truly understands the challenges. Managers often tend to get pressure from both sides: from their employees below them and from their bosses or board members above them. Often, limited resources and marching orders from above leave them feeling that their hands are tied.</p><p> Modern technologies including email, along with social networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn, allow managers to stay in touch with extended networks, including people in similar management roles in other locations. The ability to blow off steam or get quick advice from peers can help managers keep their situations in perspective and relieve stress.</p><h3> Con: More focus on the short term, less on the long term</h3><p> <br/> The frantic pace of life on the Internet tends to make everyone focus on the short term. A manager&rsquo;s day has always involved someone needing something at every moment, but email and text messages have increased the number of &ldquo;someones&rdquo; making demands at all hours. With limited time available and increasing pressure to focus on short-term needs, many managers are left without time or motivation to focus on long-term strategies and plans of action &mdash; often to the detriment of employees and organizations.</p><h3> Pro and Con: Easier monitoring of employees</h3><p> <br/> In today&rsquo;s world, most employees understand that they do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy at work. Their Internet usage may be tracked in a number of ways, including the sites they visit, the projects they work on and even the keystrokes they make. Company-issued cell phones can monitor employees&rsquo; whereabouts at every moment of the day, even during their time off.</p><p> All that monitoring can certainly shed light on employees&rsquo; productivity, but that can be both a blessing and a curse for managers whose time is already at a premium. Constant monitoring also can damage relationships and mutual trust that can take many years to build.</p><h3> How can managers use technology effectively?</h3><p> <br/> Whether it&rsquo;s a net pro or con, technology is here to stay. But skilled managers are using technology in ways that contribute to team cohesion and productivity, and they make sure that its use doesn&rsquo;t erect unnecessary barriers to honest communication. To ensure that technology  <u>  <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/businesses-use-communication-technology-improve-performance-136.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   remains a useful tool  </a> </u>  rather than an impediment, managers should:</p><li> Use email sparingly, and meet in person with team members as often as possible.</li><li> Set up a news and information section on the company intranet that allows for communication of general news to the entire team in a timely manner.</li><li> Save time by using an internal instant messaging program for quick questions and answers. <br/>  </li><h3> Technology: Changing management for the better?</h3><p> <br/> Technology is simply a tool that managers can use in positive or negative ways. For maximum communication, productivity and team harmony, managers should keep a foot in two worlds: Use technology for quick communication and sharing general information, but continue to nurture the critical element of face-to-face interaction.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 18:53:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 18:53:17.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_SUCLCTe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-is-technology-changing-management/\", \"post_id\": \"6213\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 18:53:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 18:53:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-is-technology-changing-management\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6212\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2848\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442261350644-d746b4750d4c.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"433\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442836800,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2775,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Deal with Upset Customers on Social Media","link":"how-to-deal-with-upset-customers-on-social-media","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We&rsquo;ve all dealt with upset customers &ndash; those who had a legitimate complaint and those who just want to rant.</p><p> But I urge you to consider the two as one. <strong>  Because regardless of which situation it is, both should be handled exactly the same way. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Why? </strong> Because I&rsquo;m a big believer that if we have the right mindset towards these situations from the onset, it will be much easier to handle them when they arise.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; we all have different perspectives, tastes, definitions for how we want to be treated, and definitions of what a good product or service means to us. So when someone gets upset, the best thing we can do is acknowledge it, even if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to us. Because it could make totalsense to them.</p><p> Basically, I stand with the motto I heard growing up in my parent&rsquo;s businesses, &ldquo;the customer is always right.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve all heard it before, and while you may disagree, I encourage you to see the bigger picture.</p><p> We don&rsquo;t live in a society where we can keep negative situations quiet anymore. The person who walks into our business or buys something online and isn&rsquo;t pleased could end up being our worst nightmare by spreading that negativity everywhere.</p><p> <strong>  But it doesn&rsquo;t have to end that way. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ve been working in some form of customer service since I was ten years old, and that&rsquo;s no joke. When you grow up in a family restaurant, and beg to make that bling you see sliding into the waitress&rsquo;s aprons &ndash; the lessons start early. And due to my intense personality, I had to learn quickly how to deal with unhappy people or risk losing my job.</p><p> However, that lesson has served me greatly throughout my life &ndash; continually given me raises, promotions, and helped me to make my business what it is.</p><p> <strong>  Because I view negative feedback as an opportunity. </strong> There&rsquo;s even a strange part of me that&rsquo;s pleased when someone gets upset because I get to smooth it out and make someone&rsquo;s day. There&rsquo;s no denying I&rsquo;m a major fan of these mental exercises.</p><p> But mostly because I know that some of our most loyal and vocal customers will come from the folks who initially despised us or our brand.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how to deal with upset customers on social media (and in everyday life).</p><h3> 1. Change your perspective.</h3><p> <br/> As I&rsquo;ve already said, our perspective is one of the most important things we carry with us in negative situations, and it can make or break the outcome.</p><p> The first thing we must do is to understand that anyone and everyone who frequents our business or hangs out with us online is precious &ndash; they are a human who deserves to be treated well. If they&rsquo;re spending money on us or simply talking to us, we want to take every opportunity to treat them with respect and develop a relationship, especially when it comes to online relationships.</p><p> A lot of folks on social media see a disconnect between the relationships they develop online and those developed in person. I don&rsquo;t. To me, they are the same. That perspective not only helps me to be aware of how I treat online relationships, but often reminds me to go the extra mile to be kind or thankful because they can&rsquo;t see me.</p><p> And hey &ndash; they don&rsquo;t have to like me. Or share my content. Or talk to me at all. But it&rsquo;s an honor they do!</p><p> When we change our perspective and understand that the little avatars online are real people, it&rsquo;s much easier to handle negative situations when they arise.</p><h3> 2. Take a step back.</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a quote that says we shouldn&rsquo;t make decisions when we&rsquo;re emotional, and that&rsquo;s wise advice when dealing with angry people. No, it&rsquo;s not easy to hold ourselves back or not react, but we must.</p><p> I call it &ndash; putting on our adult pants and dealing with it.</p><p> Take a step back when someone says something negative. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve had numerous people leave negative comments on Facebook Ads, via Twitter, and on blogs. The initial emotion is defensive, and possibly annoyed, frustrated, or angry. But NONE of these emotions will aid us in handling the situation.</p><p> When we purposefully take a step back, we regain our power to look at the situation objectively.</p><p> Let the emotion go, let the hurt ego subside, and try to view it objectively. What are theyreally upset about? What are they trying to say?</p><p> Online communications are often misconstrued, so it&rsquo;s vital we step back and evaluate what&rsquo;s going on before reacting.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been in situations where I waited an hour or more before responding. Do NOT rush or feel the need to handle the situation immediately, regardless of how damaging the comment is. How you reply is imperative, so give yourself the permission to wait until you can do it objectively.</p><h3> 3. Acknowledge the issue and apologize.</h3><p> <br/> The next step, and the first step towards your reply will be to acknowledge the problem and apologize, regardless of what you think.</p><p> But hey, we&rsquo;re in our higher selves now, right? So let&rsquo;s proceed that way.</p><p> &ldquo;Hi, Robert. Thank you for reaching out to let us know the product didn&rsquo;t work correctly. I&rsquo;m very sorry for this inconvenience.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Good afternoon, Janice. We&rsquo;re sorry to hear your experience at our store wasn&rsquo;t as it should be, no one likes being in that situation.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Hello, Paul. I&rsquo;m so sorry to hear our service isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;re looking for &ndash; we want you to be happy.&rdquo;</p><p> What&rsquo;s most important when crafting a reply is that you don&rsquo;t use some canned, automated sounding crap.</p><p> Be honest. Be human. Be real. Be empathetic. If you answer them with some generated response, they&rsquo;ll be even more upset. And they should be!! We&rsquo;re dealing with a person here &ndash; speak naturally.</p><p> And use &ldquo;I&rdquo; whenever possible. Depending on your business, it may be more appropriate to use &ldquo;We,&rdquo; but make sure to sign a name at the end either way.</p><p> I always sign my replies &ldquo;-Ahna&rdquo; because it helps alleviate the disconnect they feel with leaving a comment online and reminds them they&rsquo;re talking to a real person.</p><h3> 4. Offer a solution that makes sense for them.</h3><p> <br/> The second part of that response will be offering a solution that makes sense for them &ndash; not us.</p><p> When dealing with upset customers or prospects online for my clients, I contact the client to discuss the best solution we can offer them. If this is your business, then you get to skip that step. But I always involve the client because sometimes they think of things I don&rsquo;t or are able to go above and beyond what I was going to offer. In addition, it keeps things transparent with the client.</p><p> Because of my background, I&rsquo;m a fan of reimbursing an angry customer and adding on something extra for their frustration. Deciding how you will deal with unhappy customers is something that should be outlined ASAP, if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p><p> But do yourself this one favor: do NOT ever consider a financial loss to be more important than making a situation right with a customer online. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve been blown away while working with some clients who refuse to reimburse customers to make it right, even when the problem was clearly on their end. The money you save is rarely worth the customer you lose.</p><p> &ldquo;Hi Janice, we&rsquo;re sorry to hear your chocolate arrived a melted mess &ndash; that&rsquo;s terrible! We&rsquo;re going to reimburse you for your purchase and send you a fresh package on us.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Hi, Dan, thank you for making us aware you weren&rsquo;t able to access your service this month. We have resolved that issue, and are happy to reimburse you for the month and give you the next two for free.&rdquo;</p><p> Make sure the solution replaces whatever they&rsquo;ve lost at minimum. And to get those customer service gold stars &ndash; include an extra.</p><h3> 5. Ask them if it solves the problem.</h3><p> <br/> The final piece in your reply is to ask them if your solution solves the problem. This is KEY because you want to know (and you want anyone else who&rsquo;s reading this ordeal to know) 1) if they are happy with the outcome and that 2) you care.</p><p> If we don&rsquo;t ask whether our solution makes them happy, we undercut them by assuming all is well with our actions. In essence, it makes us look like we don&rsquo;t care, and that can leave people feeling cold even though we offered something fantastic.</p><p> &ldquo;Hi, Nikki. Thank you for letting us know the sweater was shedding, your feedback is very important. We apologize for the extra frustration on your end, and want to send you a new one with an additional 30% discount on your next order with us. Our company prides itself on quality clothing and we want to make sure you&rsquo;re happy. Does this sound like a good solution for you?&rdquo;</p><p> By wrapping it up and making them admit that the solution works for them, it also unconsciously closes the problem in their mind. At this point, they calm down and are thankful because they feel acknowledged and cared for.</p><h3> 6. Follow up.</h3><p> <br/> The follow up is where most businesses fall short, and where your business can shine bright!</p><p> Wait a week or a few, depending on the situation, and then reach back out to them and make sure they are pleased. If it&rsquo;s a product replacement, make sure the new product works as it should. If it&rsquo;s a service replacement, makes sure they&rsquo;re pleased with it.</p><p> When we take the extra step to follow up it can seal the deal to changing them into a loving and loyal customer because it&rsquo;s personal and unexpected.</p><p> And if you&rsquo;re doing business right &ndash; you always want to do the unexpected.</p><p> Finally, sometimes all the respectful talk in the world won&rsquo;t absolve situations, and we&rsquo;ve got to learn to let that go. I&rsquo;ve dealt with ranters who simply wanted to push and push, and I had to say, &ldquo;Thank you for your feedback, we will do our best to ensure this doesn&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I appreciate your honesty and will make sure to handle things differently the next time.&rdquo;</p><p> We always win when we acknowledge, apologize, and offer a solution that works for them.</p><p> But if that can&rsquo;t be done, the next best thing is to simply thank them, and let it go. Ruminating on a hard situation only infects our day and we can&rsquo;t allow that to happen.

{"original_id":2776,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You a 21st Century Leader?","link":"are-you-a-21st-century-leader","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I am in the midst of writing a book and I am blown away by the people I am meeting and their generosity in sharing their stories so openly. The last interview I did spanned two days and lasted 4 hours. The funny part was that we could have spent more time talking as this CEO has been a revolutionary leader. And I am sure our relationship has just started to emerge.</p><p> <strong>  What I am learning from the conversations I am having with 21st century leaders is that they are generous. compassionate and amazing storytellers. </strong> They have a way of building community and bringing people together to co-create solutions. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what their title is, they are clear about their purpose and have a desire to learn. They are not motivated by the title itself but the responsibility and accountability that the title provides. It is a means for them to do more in the world and make an impact with their chosen art.</p><p> <strong>  The first trend  </strong> I am noticing that separates them from top down hierarchal leaders is that they get their hands dirty. They don&rsquo;t delegate their responsibility for communication, diversity or innovation, for example, to a function. The 21st century leader goes into the world and breaks down walls by bringing communities together in conversations. The language they use matters so they stay away from calling people inside or outside their organization an &ldquo;audience&rdquo; or a &ldquo;stakeholder.&rdquo; They know the only time you have an audience is when you are watching a movie, a show or at a concert. The 21st century is about community and open, two-way conversations. We no longer need to yell at people and broadcast to get their attention. People want to truly be engaged in conversation and listened to. The new breed of leaders respect people and allow for communities to form where they no longer need to be at the head.</p><p> <strong>  The second trend  </strong> is around demystifying our obsession with change. The 21st century leader recognizes that change management is an antiquated business practice that no longer serves their organization. What this leader know is that if you build communities and have people feel listened to, you no longer need to sell them new programs. In this century, change is simple a reality of day-to-day life, inside and outside of work. The 21st century leader does not need to sponsor change initiatives. He needs to be clear on the shared purpose of the organization and that people can play their positions to make an impact. As he also knows how to build communities, all he needs to do is tap into the people and get the conversation going toward the new direction. There is no need for ambassadors, posters or t-shirts announcing the change. All that is needed is a culture of co-creation driven by conscious leaders who create shared purpose.</p><p> <strong>  The third trend  </strong> that is emerging is around the importance of trust and relationships. The 21st century leader knows that this is the new and old currency in business today. Without it, much is missed. It can no longer be simply a statistic or metric that is tracked over time. It has to be a way of doing business and bringing holistic solutions to organizations. Customers no longer care how an organization is structured; they care about trusting your business to do what you promise.</p><p> People today trust where they eat, where they sleep and what movies they watch, for example, based on online reviews. Most of the hands shoot up when I ask people whether they have ever eaten at a restaurant, slept at a hotel or seen a movie based on an online review. We trust strangers today for the most intimate decisions of our lives. We don&rsquo;t know these people. We don&rsquo;t know what they like and yet, we trust their opinions because we know how connected we are. This is happening every second outside the organization&rsquo;s walls. The 21st century leader sees this as a huge opportunity to build trusted relationships with their employees, customers, partners and vendors. They are breaking away through building communities that are based on trust.</p><p> <strong>  The fourth trend </strong>  is also a key one that brings vulnerability to business. The 21st century leaders does not have all the answers. She goes into situations letting people know that she doesn&rsquo;t know. She creates the space for the conversation and the solutions to emerge. The expert model is left behind in the last century where you had to be the smartest person in the room to shine. In this century, leaders show up around creating shared purpose and understanding the power of hiring the best and the brightest to partner with them.</p><p> You can tell a 21st century leader because they don&rsquo;t talk about how their organization is structured, <strong>  they focus on bringing their shared purpose to the world through their communities. </strong> I have many more conversations ahead for the book so I will continue to share with you what I find in real time. If you have a great story to share, please reach out to me.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-20 19:31:01.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-20 19:31:01.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_nV8dnEf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-a-21st-century-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"6217\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-20 19:31:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-20 19:31:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-a-21st-century-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6216\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2850\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-12.34.00-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"710\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442858400,"author_id":48,"chart_url":""}

A Look at the Candidates Views","link":"how-will-social-security-change-if-a-republican-gets-elected-a-look-at-the-candidates-views","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Having trouble keeping track of the numerous Republican candidates and their positions on the major issues of the day? Well, you are not alone. Since everything appears to be about Donald Trump and what he says, or doesn't say, the various candidates positions on many issues appears to be getting lost in the shuffle even as more and more TV time is being dedicated to hearing them speak. A three hour debate...really?</p><p> In an effort to simplify the candidates positions regarding what should be done about social security, if anything, here's a short \"cheat sheet\" which you may find helpful until the candidates refine and finalize their positions on this matter:</p><p> <strong>  DONALD TRUMP: </strong> Keep social security as is. <br/> <strong>  CARLY FIORINA: </strong> Increase FRA (to what exactly is unclear).            <br/> <strong>  BEN CARSON: </strong> Requests that you should \"voluntarily\" opt out of social security if you don't need the money. <br/> <strong>  MARCO RUBIO: </strong> Increase FRA by one year and grow benefits more slowly. <br/> <strong>  JEB BUSH: </strong> Increase Full Retirement Age (FRA) possibly up to age 70. <br/> <strong>  TED CRUZ: </strong> Increase FRA, cut cost of living adjustments and partially privatize social security (i.e. allow workers to control their own retirement funds through personal investment accounts). <br/> <strong>  MIKE HUCKABEE: </strong> Keep social security as is. <br/> <strong>  RAND PAUL: </strong> Increase FRA to age 70 and means test benefits. <br/> <strong>  CHRIS CHRISTIE: </strong> Increase FRA to 69 and means-test benefits. <br/> <strong>  JOHN KASICH: </strong> Partially privatize social security. <br/> <strong>  LINDSEY GRAHAM: </strong> Increase FRA to age 70 and cut benefits for some. <br/> <strong>  BOBBY JINDAL: </strong> Partially privatize social security. <br/> <strong>  GEORGE PATAKI:  </strong> Increase FRA. <br/> <strong>  JIM GILMORE: </strong> Cap benefits; possibly privatize social security. <br/> <strong>  RICK SANTORUM: </strong> Privatize social security, increase FRA and means test benefits. <br/> <strong>  SCOTT WALKER: </strong> Increase FRA.</p><p> To briefly sum up, it appears that all these candidates, except for Trump, Hukabee and Carson, favors either raising the FRA or partially privatizing social security. Ironically, these positions are not desired by rank and file Republicans. Recent polling shows 62% of Republicans favor \"increasing\" social security benefits and 74% are willing to preserve social security even if it means raising taxes. In fact, only 26% of Republicans favor increasing the FRA to age 70. <br/> <br/> Clearly, whether you are a Republican or Democrat, any proposed changes to social security will come with much heated debate, especially for those voters who are nearing retirement. Change is slow and difficult to come by in Washington. But as millions of Americans grow older and face the challenges of financing what could amount to a 20-30 year retirement period, any reduction to social security benefits could have a material if not devastating effect on one's retirement. Perhaps creativity and compromise could provide the foundation for the continuation of this much valued and desired entitlement program.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 14:38:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 14:38:54.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_nQNt2VM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-will-social-security-change-if-a-republican-gets-elected-a-look-at-the-candidates-views/\", \"post_id\": \"6219\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 14:38:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 14:38:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-will-social-security-change-if-a-republican-gets-elected-a-look-at-the-candidates-views\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6218\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2851\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-7.40.01-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"653\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442923200,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2778,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Helping Heirs: Strategies to Help Strengthen Relationships with Wealth Inheritors","link":"helping-heirs-strategies-to-help-strengthen-relationships-with-wealth-inheritors","source_link":null,"content":"<p><strong>Sponsored by Fidelity Investments </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Chelsea and her younger sister lost their mother a year ago following a stroke, the family&rsquo;s financial advisors did more than just make recommendations regarding the roughly $3 million the two young women were set to inherit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They were very kind and went out of their way to help us,&rdquo; said Chelsea, 30. They not only gave careful and patient explanations but showed true concern. Knowing Chelsea was overwhelmed by her mother&rsquo;s death and caring for her newborn baby, they went to her house and &ldquo;just hung out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Chelsea, largely because of their patience, thoughtfulness and willingness to listen, these advisors are still working with her and her family, an uncommon scenario according to the often‐cited statistic that 90 percent of today&rsquo;s heirs don&rsquo;t retain their parents&rsquo; advisors. <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a> Like Chelsea, some of those heirs will be women, as $30 trillion in inter‐generational wealth changes hands over the next 40 years. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2] </a> But unlike Chelsea, many heirs may not see a strong enough reason to stick with their parent&rsquo;s advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may have nothing to do with an individual advisor or his or her performance, industry experts say: according to the report by global consulting firm Accenture &ldquo;The &lsquo;Greater&rsquo; Wealth Transfer: Capitalizing on the Intergenerational Shift in Wealth,&rdquo; Millennials are less trusting of financial advisors than previous generations. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [3] </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;[In our experience], the kids don&rsquo;t necessarily have bad feelings toward the advisor; they just don&rsquo;t feel connected to him or her. And they don&rsquo;t feel that they were treated as a partner in the decision making,&rdquo; said Robert N. Grant of Grant &amp; Gordon LLP, a law firm specializing in the transfer of wealth. &ldquo;The person is almost always viewed as their parents&rsquo; advisor, and often they want to get their own advisor. That doesn&rsquo;t always happen, but it can be part of establishing their independence, outside of the shadow of what are sometimes very successful parents with strong personalities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that losing the family&rsquo;s business when a client passes away is not inevitable. There are practical strategies for retention that advisors may want to consider using both before and after a client&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Not Your Parent&rsquo;s Advisor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nEstablishing a relationship with the entire family and meeting with inheritors long before the principal client passes away may seem like a nobrainer, but there&rsquo;s more to it than just including clients&rsquo; heirs in meetings. Heirs may need to feel their own connection to the advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Anne Rieder, managing director at VennWell, says her firm builds trust and establishes a connection with clients&rsquo; heirs by treating their personal financial planning as part of the clients&rsquo; package and fee. &ldquo;We will offer to do a financial plan for those family members. Even if they&rsquo;re in their twenties and just investing in a 401(k),&rdquo; Rieder said. &ldquo;We give them 2 the same level of service because we look at the family as the relationship, not just the person.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also very real generational differences to consider, such as preferred methods of communication&mdash;email versus text, for example. Jane Williams, Chairman and co‐founder of Sand Hill Global Advisors, says her firm often assigns a younger, more compatible advisor to work with the heirs. &ldquo;We really want to see advisors be able to relate to the next generation,&rdquo; Williams said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grant agrees that this may be an effective way of getting around the difficulty of changing habits of older advisors. &ldquo;If the investment advisor is relating to someone who has grown children, they will typically not be young themselves. And that ability to adjust to a younger generation requires skills that many traditional, older advisors don&rsquo;t necessarily have or are unwilling to take on. Habits are difficult to break.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Listen Up</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSo are personal styles. If you want a relationship to continue after the principal client passes, then you may want to consider the huge emotional component of inheriting money, especially with female clients. &ldquo;Often female clients complain that the advisor would listen, but they felt like they were just listening enough to then be able to develop a plan,&rdquo; said Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, author of How to Give Financial Advice to Women: Attracting and Retaining High‐Net‐Worth Female Clients. &ldquo;Female clients want to be listened to in a way where they feel understood and cared for, and then they can make a plan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may mean being patient, waiting until the person is ready to deal with the money, and remembering that along with inherited money most often there comes a set of complicated emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It can feel a little uncomfortable because it&rsquo;s knotted up with the pain of loss,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;A lot of our clients feel an awesome responsibility, not just a gift or sense of freedom, though it may bring those feelings as well. Some people even feel guilt when they get this money.&rdquo; Chelsea certainly understands this. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to accept and use the money,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We grew up pretty well‐off, but my parents worked very hard for that money.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of Chelsea&rsquo;s inheritance from her parents&mdash;her father passed away before her mother&mdash;was placed in a trust that she and her sister don&rsquo;t have full control over until they&rsquo;re 35. Their parents&rsquo; financial advisor, now her advisor, is co‐executor, so Chelsea has to get the advisor&rsquo;s approval before she can use the funds. This adds to the feelings of guilt, Chelsea said, even though she&rsquo;s only taken money out of the trust for such practical things as starting a college fund and childcare for her baby. &ldquo;It still feels strange to ask for it,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the feelings around inheriting money may best be addressed early on, says Eleanor Blayney, the CFP&reg; Boardʹs consumer advocate. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t have these discussions with their elderly parents,&rdquo; Blayney said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to because it seems like they&rsquo;re just waiting to see what money they get. Sometimes the best role a financial planner can play is to facilitate these conversations. Get people around the table and take some of the 3 stigma out of the discussion of money between parents and kids.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Digital Connection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOf course, one advisor&rsquo;s loss can be another&rsquo;s gain when inheriting clients walk away from their parents&rsquo; wealth managers. According to Accenture&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Greater Wealth Transfer,&rdquo; the most important traits to consider if you want to attract Millennials are their tendency to use social media for recommendations and to do their own research online before they contact you. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [4] </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accenture suggests that advisors may want to consider developing an online presence built around educational material shared on your website, blog, and through various social media platforms. The report also suggests that advisors consider getting active on social media by sharing original content and other relevant information. <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [5] </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Having a strong online presence has always been a priority,&rdquo; Rieder said. &ldquo;This year, we refreshed our website and launched an online portal where clients may access their account information anytime, and we will be rolling out a mobile app in the first half of 2015. This is the kind of account access the next generation is looking for, and we are prepared.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBased on the discussion above, here are some strategies advisors may want to consider to help retain clients through the generations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Be sensitive about discussing finances with heirs immediately following the death of a loved one </strong> &mdash;take your cues from family members about when to bring up the issue of financial planning.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Treat the whole family as your client </strong> &mdash;make heirs feel like they are part of the plan.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Encourage discussions between parents and children on inheritance issues and feelings early </strong> &mdash;before a loved one passes away.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Try to pair heirs with advisors they can relate to: </strong> younger advisors may work well with younger heirs.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Craft an effective digital strategy to reach out to Millennials </strong> &mdash;who often prefer to conduct their financial business online.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related Articles </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keeping It in the Family: </strong> <u> <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/295685437;122627444;q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Four Ways to Help Build Client Relationships Across Generations </a> </u></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Winning Younger Investors: </strong> <u> <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/295685438;122627444;r\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Six Ways to Help Attract Gen-X and Gen-Y Clients </a> </u><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>HNW Wealth News, &ldquo;X, Y, and #: Capitalizing on the Next Wealth Boom,&rdquo; 2013.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>Accenture, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Greater&rsquo; Wealth Transfer: Capitalizing on the Intergenerational Shift in Wealth,&rdquo; 2012.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>Ibid.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a>Ibid.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a>Ibid.

{"original_id":2780,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Seeking Value","link":"seeking-value","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There was a genie that had fallen on hard times.  <strong>  Instead of giving away wishes, he decided to sell them as a way of earning some income and getting back on his feet. </strong>   He could grant practically any wish (provided it did no harm to others) with a snap of his fingers.  He charged what he believed were fair prices, depending on the value of the wish.</p><p> One day a woman approaches and she really wants to live longer.  Her life is great, she&rsquo;s healthy, and she wants to enjoy it as long as possible.  The genie explains that he can extend her life for a cost of $5,000 per year.  If she wants an additional five years, she can pay $25,000, he will snap his fingers, and voila.  For ten years, $50,000, a snap of the fingers, and it&rsquo;s done.</p><p> The woman thinks about it.  &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the same amount of work for you regardless of how many years I get&hellip; I want to pay one flat price whether I choose five or ten years.&rdquo; </p><p> Does her reasoning seem absurd to you?  It does to me.  She is focusing on the amount of work done by the genie, rather than on the value of his service.  The amount of work being done is largely irrelevant &ndash; a service with greater value can and should cost more.</p><p> This is why we charge our clients a percentage of the assets we manage.  Is it twice as much work to manage $1,000,000 compared to $500,000?  Probably not.  Is the value to the client twice as great?  Absolutely.  By allocating investments efficiently, strategically rebalancing and harvesting losses, and preventing mistakes in volatile markets, we are adding value to every dollar we manage.</p><p> Because we often include financial planning services in our investment fee, there is an important secondary reason to charge more for larger accounts &ndash; they are frequently (though not always) accompanied by more complex planning issues.  The more planning issues we can help with, the greater the value for the client.</p><p> Recently, there has been much writing and discussion critical of this fee model and in favor of a flat fee, independent of assets managed.  I think there are merits to this model as an alternative in certain situations, and that generally speaking, the more flexible a planner can be with their fee structure, the better it is for everyone.  But the key reason for charging a percentage is often ignored in these conversations &ndash; that each dollar well-managed adds value for the client. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 18:53:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 18:53:30.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_LLDzqx9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/seeking-value/\", \"post_id\": \"6225\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 18:53:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 18:53:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"seeking-value\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6224\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2854\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.54.12-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"527\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442925000,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2781,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Winning Strategies Investing and Fantasy Football Share","link":"3-winning-strategies-investing-and-fantasy-football-share","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As the NFL season begins, millions of fantasy football fans are busy researching and drafting their teams. And this season, as in previous ones, fans will be wondering why some fantasy team managers just seem to have a knack for finding those sleepers and high upside players, while other managers routinely fail to understand and predict player value.</p><p> Investors often wonder the same thing: why do some investors consistently get it right and prosper, while others are lucky if they even break even?</p><p> Coincidence? Maybe, but there are several important things successful fantasy football managers have in common with successful real-life investors.</p><p> Here are three important mindsets that can help you go the whole 9 yards, whether it&rsquo;s on the virtual gridiron or with your own financial plan.</p><h3> Research the Players</h3><p> <br/> A good fantasy football manager knows that you need to study all the different variables &ndash; including roster positions, draft picks, and expected performance &ndash; to build a winning team. Understanding the available options is critical to determining things like how many players you need at each position and which players you think will be the best.</p><p> This same principal applies to investing. A smart investor or financial advisor starts by understanding all the different variables, such as capital, types of investments, and asset classes. Understanding the pros and cons of various investment strategies is critical in determining how to choose a strategy that is the appropriate option for your own goals and needs.</p><h3> Never count on a couple of stars to carry the team</h3><p> <br/> When drafting your fantasy team, you always want to diversify your risk. You might not want to draft multiple offense players from the Green Bay Packers, for instance, even if that team is loaded with talent, because, if Aaron Rodgers and company have a bad week, your fantasy team will be struggling too. Smart fantasy managers build a stable foundation and don&rsquo;t just count on rising stars.</p><p> When building your investment portfolio, risk diversification is critical as well. Wall Street is littered with stories of investors who put all their eggs in one &ldquo;sure&rdquo; basket, only to learn the lesson of diversification the hard way. Even if you&rsquo;re extremely confident that a certain sector is a good bet, it&rsquo;s usually better to diversify and limit your amount of exposure to individual sectors. That way, even if the sector doesn&rsquo;t do as well as you had anticipated, your investments are distributed across other asset classes, and your risk should be better managed.</p><h3> When the going gets tough, the tough stay disciplined</h3><p> <br/> Anyone who has played fantasy football knows the danger of making a snap waiver wire decision you&rsquo;ll regret later. On one hand, you don&rsquo;t want to panic and drop your star player after a rough few weeks, only to see him rebound to a MVP-caliber season (and on someone else&rsquo;s team!) On the other hand, just because an unproven player has a great week doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s more valuable than the player you&rsquo;d have to drop in order to acquire him.</p><p> When the market hits a volatile patch, it takes a disciplined investor to trust their plan and avoid making snap decisions about buying and selling. A look at the history of the stock market makes it abundantly clear that investors who take a long term view do better than those who shift their investment strategies with every changing wind. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that any plan should be viewed as foolproof; a good investor or financial advisor knows the value of reassessing and recalibrating appropriately and strategically. What it does mean is that, when the going gets tough, a prudent investor takes the long view, stays disciplined, and sticks to a strategy.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s a long season</h3><p> <br/> The only NFL team in history to have an undefeated season is the Miami Dolphins who finished 17-0 in the shorter 1972 season. No NFL team has gone 19-0 to date so it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that any fantasy team will achieve perfection either. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t have a great season and get smarter and smarter about putting together a winning team.</p><p> With investing too, there will always be ups and downs, touchdowns and penalties, fumbles and conversions, and a few Hail Mary&rsquo;s. But with a solid game plan and clearly defined goal, you&rsquo;ll be on your way to a putting together a strategy designed to stand the test of time and put you squarely where you want to be: heading toward your own end zone with your eye on the ball and your own goals in sight.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 18:56:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 18:56:58.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_E3NWafr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-winning-strategies-investing-and-fantasy-football-share/\", \"post_id\": \"6227\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 18:56:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 18:56:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-winning-strategies-investing-and-fantasy-football-share\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6226\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2855\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-2.47.08-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"312\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442941200,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

Part of the reason is that copywriters are often detached from their products. They do the writing, it&rsquo;s turned over to corporate, and the writer moves onto the next piece, without receiving any feedback. Nowadays, there are ample metrics to measure copywriting success, which should be reviewed periodically to update the company copy policy.

We regularly review performance statistics for our clients and develop instructions for our writers that are in-line with creating compelling content for client audiences. Through a content audit, we often identify and correct basic errors that improve search engine rankings in a jiffy. Most of the issues we come across are not so much &ldquo;bad writing,&rdquo; but rather, evidence of a dated SEO policy. Here are 8 copywriting myths that are surprisingly pervasive, but need to die once and for all:</p><h3> 1. Keyword density matters.</h3><p> Five years ago, we were giving our writers instructions based on keyword research. It made sense to connect the copy with the exact search terms people were typing into Google. Keyword density was as high as 10% for longer content or as little as 2%. Special emphasis was placed on titles and headers, the first and last paragraphs, SEO descriptions and and image titles.</p><p> Unfortunately, writers were dissatisfied with what people were typing into the search engines. It wasn&rsquo;t always easy to work a phrase like &ldquo;home builders Augusta GA&rdquo; into a paragraph naturally. Repeating long-tail keyword phrases like &ldquo;best roofing contractors in Kansas City&rdquo; made the text sound clunky. Likewise, search engines have shifted to prefer more variety and use additional qualifiers for identifying great content.</p><h3> 2. Write natural and don&rsquo;t bother with keyword research.</h3><p> Even though keywords and phrases don&rsquo;t carry the sway they used to, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are to be forgotten entirely. Our optimization of content still involves reviewing content and adding a well-integrated key phrase in here and there. We think of it as a pinch of salt added to the copy. We also follow these principles:</p><p> &ndash; All blogs should be based on value for the audience, not centered on a specific keyword.</p><p> &ndash; Great articles are so well written they&rsquo;re quotable and packed with research compiled from outside sources.</p><p> &ndash; Focusing on creating exceptional content leads to blog subscribers, social sharing, backlinks and conversions.</p><p> What makes quality SEO content? Here are a few ideas:</p><p> <a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/quality-content.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"high quality contnet\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/quality-content-1024x933.gif\"/> </a></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/types-of-success-high-quality-content_506885b1c3f4f.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Visual.ly  </a> </u></p><h3> 3. Press release anchor text is the best way to get tons of links.</h3><p> Press releases used to get our clients on the fast track to success. Adding in keyphrase-rich anchor text and syndicating premium releases to the news wires yielded thousands of links and first page results. While many press release wires still come up in the Google news feed and search engine results, guidelines have changed to disallow spammy anchor text. It&rsquo;s less of an SEO vehicle than it used to be, but the value is not all lost.We still use press releases as a tool for building awareness, attracting major news outlet attention, thought leadership and branding.</p><h3> 4. Inflate the text as much as you can to get better Google rankings.</h3><p> We remember when the recommendation was &ldquo;400-500 word minimums for articles,&rdquo; which later changed to &ldquo;1,500 word or longer posts.&rdquo; The end result was copy that repeated itself way too much and provided too little value for readers. It may have been the best decision to make Tolkien&rsquo;s epic &ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo; saga into three separate 3-hour-long films, but critics didn&rsquo;t feel the same way about &ldquo;The Hobbit,&rdquo; which could have easily been one action-packed two-hour movie. By the same token, you don&rsquo;t want to over-inflate your topic just to reach some arbitrary &ldquo;magic number.&rdquo; The general rule of thumb is: Write as much as you have to say and nothing more.</p><p> That said, 150-word posts rarely say enough to offer value to a reader. Shorter posts are the role of social media platforms. People digging into blogs want a little more meat-and-potatoes for dinner &mdash; not just a side salad. We find that longer posts do tend to get more social shares, allow brands the space to demonstrate expertise and uses more natural keyword combinations that appeal to searchers. You want to find a healthy blend between quick, digestible bits of inspiration and well-researched, in-depth content. If you have trouble crafting the occasional longer post, find someone who can help out.</p><p> <a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/content-length.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"content length\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/content-length.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-ideal-length-of-everything-online-according-to-science\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BufferApp.com  </a> </u></p><h3> 5. Cram keywords into headings and headlines.</h3><p> We still use keywords in H1, H2 and H3 tags &mdash; but only if we can work them in naturally and usefully. Using heading tags is still a good practice for online writing, as it breaks up larger chunks of text into manageable sections that allows readers to skim through as they see fit and get an idea as to where your piece is heading. For instance, readers don&rsquo;t want to read headings like &ldquo;Best plastic surgeon in Florida&rdquo; because it doesn&rsquo;t really tell them what to expect in the subsequent paragraphs; a much better headline would be &ldquo;How to find the best plastic surgeon in Florida.&rdquo;</p><h3> 6. Outbound links will only make people leave your site.</h3><p> An outbound link could send traffic skipping past your blog and onto what they may view as a &ldquo;more credible source.&rdquo; If that&rsquo;s the case, then your writer is simply not creating enough value within the post. We don&rsquo;t just create posts that parrot another source&rsquo;s information simply using different words. We compile information from multiple different sources and borrow from our own experiences to deliver a unique product. A truly worthwhile blog should never be afraid to link relevant anchor text to authority sites. Doing so lets search engines know that your main mission is to provide the most relevant and useful information to your readers &mdash; not just shamelessly self-promote.</p><h3> 7. Guest posting leads to penalties.</h3><p> In January of last year, Google&rsquo;s Matt Cutts scared the crap out of everyone with  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-blogging/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this post  </a> </u>  on &ldquo;the decay and fall of guest posting.&rdquo; He reported on the abuse of the system, where guest blogging basically turned into paying for PageRank or the publishing of spammy links masquerading as expert opinion. He called out articles about &ldquo;how to automate guest posting.&rdquo;</p><p> What people missed was the section at the end of Matt Cutts&rsquo; post that clarified: &rdquo; I&rsquo;m not trying to throw the baby out with the bath water. There are still many good reasons to do some guest blogging (exposure, branding, increased reach, community, etc.)&hellip;. And there are absolutely some fantastic, high-quality guest bloggers out there&hellip;. High-quality multi-author blogs like Boing Boing have been around since the beginning of the web, and they can be compelling, wonderful, and useful.&rdquo;</p><p> The take-away is not to cease all guest blogging entirely, but instead to seek out high-quality sites that can share your expertise and help you build your brand.</p><h3> 8. Hiring SEO professionals and copywriters will be too expensive.</h3><p> Mod Girl Marketing deals with budgets of every shape and size. Most of our clients have rather large marketing budgets, but we&rsquo;ve worked with entrepreneurs, start-ups and non-profits as well. Quality copy is an attainable investment anyone can make. You don&rsquo;t need to buy 100 pages of content for your website, 50 premium press releases, 60 blogs per month and an eBook to improve your search ranking, traffic and conversions. Every enterprise is different. We develop a custom package specific to your needs, your industry and your strategic business goals.

{"original_id":2783,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Do Your Employees Hate You?","link":"why-do-your-employees-hate-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don&rsquo;t have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.&rdquo;  &mdash;Nelson Mandela </p><p> I am surprised when managers act shocked to find out that their employees don&rsquo;t like them. You have to remember that the way you think affects your behavior and your behavior determines how your employees react to you. If you don&rsquo;t pay close attention to your thoughts this can become a vicious cycle. So, why do your employees hate you?</p><h3> You think your title makes you a leader</h3><p> <br/> I can tell you that one of the biggest factors that causes employees to hate you as their manager is if you think that your title makes you a leader. You don&rsquo;t become a leader just because you get placed in a management position. Leadership is something that you grow into and earn. Chances are that if you think your title makes you a leader, you also think it entitles you to power. You may have control over rewards or consequences that give you the power to accomplish short-term tasks. This, however, does not equate to long-term power that is earned through respect.</p><h3> They don&rsquo;t trust you</h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t trust your employees, they won&rsquo;t trust you. People like people they trust. Animosity is created when your employees&rsquo; notice that you think you know more than them, you stop listening to what they have to say, and you are always keeping score. When it appears that you do not trust them, they stop engaging with you even when you ask them questions. They don&rsquo;t feel like they can be themselves around you. You can&rsquo;t command trust and respect, you have to give it first and then earn it.</p><h3> You fail to build relationships</h3><p> <br/> Even if you had strong relationships at some point, when you were promoted you may have become distant and bureaucratic. Your relationships may have become superficial and fake; employees can see right through your facade. After making the move into a management position, it is easy to forget what it&rsquo;s like to be the low man on the totem pole or working on the front lines. You fail to build relationships on an individual basis where each employee knows that you care about them personally. If you start relying on email as your main form of communication you lose that face-to-face interaction that can be so important to relationship building. You don&rsquo;t encourage, welcome, ask for, or act on feedback which reinforces the perception that you don&rsquo;t care what your employees have to say.</p><h3> You have something to prove</h3><p> <br/> You think that leadership requires you to make sure everyone knows you&rsquo;re in charge. In fact, it is quite the opposite. If you need to prove that you are in charge, you&rsquo;re not a leader. You feel you have something to prove, all the time. You&rsquo;re smarter, stronger, braver, or more powerful; it&rsquo;s always something. You default to the use of fear and intimidation when you feel you&rsquo;re not getting the respect you think you deserve. And, you never admit when you are wrong. No one likes a know-it-all. If you are always trying to one-up your employees, chances are they will start to hate you.</p><h3> You don&rsquo;t value their contributions</h3><p> <br/> When you think you&rsquo;re all that, you tend to minimize the contributions of others. When you don&rsquo;t recognize the value of your employees&rsquo; contributions or reward them for a job well done their distaste for you grows. If you don&rsquo;t recognize their value you will fail to challenge them or engage their creativity. Everyone wants to feel that their contributions are valued and that their efforts are worthwhile.</p><h3> Turn it Around</h3><p> So, now you know some of the main reasons your employees might hate you, what can you do to turn it around? Start by recognizing that you become a manager by being promoted or hired into that position, but you become a leader by focusing on the needs of others rather than gaining power for yourself. Show your employees that you trust them and their abilities, communicate openly, and stop keeping score. Remember that you are not a leader if you need to prove that you are in charge. And finally, recognize that every employee adds value. Leadership is influence, and you can&rsquo;t influence those who hate you. Pay close attention to your thoughts for they will become your behavior. Turn it around.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 19:16:46.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 19:16:46.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_UwdfgMw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-do-your-employees-hate-you/\", \"post_id\": \"6231\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 19:16:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 19:16:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-do-your-employees-hate-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6230\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2857\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/voodoo-dolls-wallpaper.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1006\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://thiswayoutgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2014_11_04-Tanya-Rapacz-and-Lisette-Smith-of-The-Partnership-on-Exit-This-Way1.mp3\\n\\n32202750\\n\\naudio/mpeg\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442946900,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

Many readers might approach this news with a healthy dose of skepticism. Haven&rsquo;t we been told that fossil fuels are falling out of favor? Aren&rsquo;t governments placing caps on coal use to appease environmentalists and climate change crusaders?</p><p> It&rsquo;s true that coal demand in China has declined a huge 6 percent so far in 2015, the result of anti-air pollution laws that temporarily restricted not just coal use but also factory operations and the amount of driving you can do. Last month I shared a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinae28099s-economy-is-undergoing-a-huge-transformation-that-no-onee28099s-talking-about/#.VfLuBZc0O3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   striking photo of a man  </a> </u>  cycling through Beijing, a brilliant blue sky overhead&mdash;something I&rsquo;ve personally never seen in my 25 years of visiting the city.

In other words, as the energy pie gets much bigger, each slice should likewise grow.</p><p> By 2025, Macquarie writes, coal will still play a dominant role in China&rsquo;s energy mix.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Coal-to-Remain-the-Dominant-Energy-Source-in-China-by-2025-09152015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Coal-to-Remain-the-Dominant-Energy-Source-in-China-by-2025\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Coal-to-Remain-the-Dominant-Energy-Source-in-China-by-2025-09152015.png\"/> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s possible that if China&rsquo;s coal consumption dramatically declines, India will be there to fill the hole. Macquarie estimates that by 2025, India&rsquo;s energy demand will rise 71 percent, with coal taking the lead among oil, gas, hydro, nuclear and others. The south Asian country is already the second-largest importer of thermal coal, and it might very well surpass China in the coming years. Macquarie writes:</p><p> Although all energy use will rise [in India], coal is the major theme as consumption and local production are both set to almost double by 2025 on the back of large-scale coal power plant construction plans.</p><p> The group adds that, unlike China, India has no present interest in reigning in its use of coal. Most emerging markets, India included, recognize that coal is an extremely affordable and reliable source of energy, necessary to drive economic growth.</p><p> Even if these predictions don&rsquo;t come to fruition, the consensus is that we haven&rsquo;t yet seen peak coal use in Asia. Estimates vary depending on the agency, but everyone seems to agree that demand in the medium-term will rise before it retreats. A 2014 MIT study even suggests that Chinese coal consumption could rise more than 70 percent between 2012 and 2040.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Consensus-We-Havent-Seen-Peak-Coal-Use-in-China-09152015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Consensus-We-Havent-Seen-Peak-Coal-Use-in-China\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2015_ft/Jul-Dec/Consensus-We-Havent-Seen-Peak-Coal-Use-in-China-09152015.png\"/> </a></p><h3> Follow the Smart Money</h3><p> <br/> With prices at multi-year lows and coal producers under pressure, some big name investors have used this as an opportunity to accumulate shares in depressed stocks.

What you&rsquo;d planned to happen versus what actually did. It&rsquo;s not about how your client or colleagues could have improved. No sir. It&rsquo;s about how YOU could have better served your vision.</p><p> No finger pointing. No righteous anger. Just an inward focused understanding of what you did that derailed your plan. When it involves multiple team members, each one looks to his/her own role and shares their perspective on JUST THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve worked inside firms where this would have been career suicide. But that first mentor&mdash;Don M&mdash;always made it safe. Because his allegiance was to the work. He was a purist. A man of towering integrity who you could always count on to do the right thing  for the work.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re running your own firm, after action reviews&mdash;and not just for the projects that went sideways&mdash;are lifesavers.</p><p> It&rsquo;s how we learn which clients (and team members) we&rsquo;re temperamentally suited for. If you can do a clear-eyed after action review and own your mistakes, you have a clarity that will help you avoid those same missteps or the circumstances that produced them.</p><p> I once had a client who would not (or could not) tame her temper. I never knew who would be on the other end of the line&mdash;the seasoned pro who came to meetings well-prepared and focused&mdash;or the temporary werewolf who used her consultants as a misplaced outlet for her anger.</p><p> An AAR after our first project together made me quickly realize that I was not doing my best work for her. Sure I could blame it on her mercurial personality, but that wasn&rsquo;t the point. It&rsquo;s that I couldn&rsquo;t produce the great work she deserved. She wasn&rsquo;t going to change her style and I wasn&rsquo;t willing to adapt.</p><p> We parted ways amicably.</p><p> The point is, very few projects&mdash;or relationships for that matter&mdash;proceed exactly the way we planned. And when the results suck, it&rsquo;s time to understand why or we&rsquo;re doomed to repeat them.</p><p> Try the after action review.

{"original_id":2786,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Tech Tips to Engage Millennials in the Classroom","link":"5-tech-tips-to-engage-millennials-in-the-classroom","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  I knew teaching an Executive Leadership graduate class of millennials would rank exceptionally high on the challenge meter. </strong> If asked about the degree of difficulty, I give it a 10 and say it&rsquo;s like Stage 1 episode of American Ninja Warrior. <strong>  You had better be prepared and in tip top shape when you enter the arena </strong> , particularly in tech, or your highly intelligent, digital native students might just put you on silent mode. I didn&rsquo;t need the latest edition of the New Teachers Survival Guide to tell me so. As the parent of 2 millennials, 25 and 23, I gave them their first flip phone, BlackBerry, computer, iPod, iTunes account, laptop, and Wi-Fi connection &ndash; all in that order. Just as their world was changing, mine too was being reinvented by a plethora of digital devices, especially by the Smartphone.</p><p> Emerging technologies has caused a monumental shift in how we learn, especially for colleges and universities who must constantly innovate just to stay relevant. Like it or not, today&rsquo;s college professor must use every digital tool at his or her disposal if they want to hold the attention of their social savvy, millennial students. This does not mean some sort of geekish reinvention of yourself but rather an attempt to utilize some of these tools to reimagine the classroom learning experience. Personally, I experimented with many different techniques my students appreciated, some worked, and some didn&rsquo;t (they weren't shy about telling me so).</p><p> <strong>  Drum roll please. </strong> Here are the 5 tech tips that made the grade in the millennial classroom:</p><li> <strong>  Disrupt the PowerPoint. </strong> Nothing kills the attention graph faster than a boring PowerPoint. I made a very intentional decision to try out another presentation alternative for the first night of class and used a product called emaze. Not only did emaze offer attractive layout designs and cool transition effects, you could easily share the presentation via a public or private link and download the files to PDF (premium version only). Check out the link  <a href=\"https://www.emaze.com/@AOCWWFRQ/nyu-sps-executive-leadership-day-one---sp2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   NYU SPS Executive Leadership Spring 2015 and see for yourself  </u>  .  </a></li><li> <strong>  Go mobile. </strong>  A graduate level course in Executive Leadership requires adherence to a professional code of conduct, extreme punctuality, and making yourself available for office hours. I used mobile technology like texting for emergencies and Facetime and Skype for virtual office hours. Face-to-face meetings went mobile too with alerts and appointment reminders that showed up on my iPhone 6 Plus. The result 99% of my students were on-time!</li><li> <strong>  Use gamification. </strong> Who doesn&rsquo;t love to play a game and have fun in the process? I used a paid app called Decide Now to breathe a competitive spirit to the dreaded midterm leadership assignment. As we sat in a close-knit circle, students each took a turn &ldquo;spinning the wheel&rdquo; to decide the order of making oral presentations. That class was ranked in the top 3 as one of the best and most engaging.  <br/> Customize the app with any of your own labels. Here's  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A quick video to show the Decide Now app in action  </a> </u> !</li><li> <strong>  Share resources on social. </strong> I found many pertinent articles and resources to benefit my students. Social media, particularly Twitter, allowed me to share these links in an instant and quite easily. I saved valuable time by posting the link one time on Twitter instead of opening an email application, writing a group message, and then distributing it. This same Tweet could be retweeted by my students, favorited for archiving, and passed on to their circles if they wanted to share leadership articles of interest.</li><li> <strong>  Supplement with YouTube. </strong> I used YouTube to supplement discussions in class and readings in our textbook, &ldquo;Business Leadership&rdquo; by Joan V. Gallos. These videos added a 4th dimension to the material and facilitated a more meaningful dialogue of leadership theory and history. For example, we watched the renowned &ldquo;I Have a Dream Speech&rdquo; by one of the most influential leaders of the American civil rights movement, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vDWWy4CMhE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  </u> </a>  and met award winning business and management thought Dr. John P. Kotter, Harvard Business School Professor through his <u>  website. </u>   <br/>  </li><p> I hope you'll try some of these tips out for yourself. Please take a moment to like this post and comment with some of your own suggestions.</p><p> Millennials, please chime in, there's over 77 million of you!</p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 19:48:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 19:48:03.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_sReTnVg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-tech-tips-to-engage-millennials-in-the-classroom/\", \"post_id\": \"6237\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 19:48:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 19:48:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-tech-tips-to-engage-millennials-in-the-classroom\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6236\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2860\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/graduate-program-media-arts-and-design.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1517\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442942100,"author_id":485,"chart_url":""}

This old adage couldn&rsquo;t be truer in the blogging world.</p><p> We like to promote content, good content. But we also know that you have to write something that people want to read, and you can&rsquo;t spend weeks crafting a good piece.</p><p> In order to meet your own needs and give your readers what they want, you are going to need to write about something that you&rsquo;re sure they are interested in. This is at least half the battle &mdash; getting them to click the article.</p><p> Fill it with good content and a unique spin on the topic, and you&rsquo;ve probably got yourself a great piece that will result in more customer engagement.</p><h3> Customer Engagement, not content, is king</h3><p> <br/> After you&rsquo;ve written your amazing content, <strong>  you need to come up with a clever way of getting your audience to respond. </strong> If you get great traction from fans in your email follow-ups, or you successfully spark conversations on FaceBook or LinkedIn, use those same techniques to get traction for your blog site.</p><p> And, don&rsquo;t forget to follow up from time to time directly with your readers. It shows your engaged and in tune with your audience.</p><h3> Be direct</h3><p> <br/> Address comments head-on and openly. Don&rsquo;t just write &lsquo;Thanks for sharing!&rsquo;. You won&rsquo;t gain much traction with your readers, and they certainly won&rsquo;t want to comment further.</p><p> The goal here is to take five to ten minutes per day and respond to your first few commenters, so that you can start turning your readers into engaged and active conversations. This is how a community is formed.</p><h3> Give something to get something</h3><p> <br/> People love to get free stuff. Offer up something to entice your readers to engage with you. Try a prize drawing for a free service, or a simple gift card around the holidays for a random commenter. This is sure to get people to leave you a note.</p><p> By offering your potential customers something of value, you&rsquo;re positioning your business as an expert, building brand affinity, and driving future sales.</p><h3> Tweet, Tweet, Tweet!</h3><p> <br/> Finally, website traffic and customer engagement are pivotal in winning in social media. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to hit up your social media channels for comments &mdash; but be careful not to look like your begging for likes or retweets. If you want to test out a new idea, service, or product, offer something of value (or a free service) to get the person on board.</p><h3> Get feedback</h3><p> <br/> If you want to know what people are thinking, the most powerful way to find out is to simply ask.</p><p> Even on this page, you&rsquo;ll notice a pop-up that asks our audience the type of content they want to receive. Our readers have asked for more on content marketing, and website design posts, so this is what we&rsquo;re crafting more of.

{"original_id":2788,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Human Sales Traits that Technology Cannot Replace","link":"6-human-sales-traits-that-technology-cannot-replace","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Everything in today&rsquo;s business environment seems to be about technology, the latest developments, content marketing, microblogs, engagement, SEOs, etc.</p><p> Some companies have become over-systematized, as I call it. Everything and I mean everything is left to automation. Once the database is set-up and your name is entered you get emails on a regular basis whether they are relevant to your current need or not.</p><p> In a consultative sales environment technology should only be utilized to support the sales process, but never to replace it. People want to feel special and they don&rsquo;t want to be viewed as a mass target.</p><p> Here are some examples of what technology lacks.</p><h3> Common Sense</h3><p> <br/> Common sense is the least common of the senses. I love that saying and it is so true. The more technology focused we become, the less we use our common sense. Why is that? Because we rely on it too often and feel that everything we need can be found on the internet. There are statistics that show that we are getting dumber and dumber. I would argue that we are also getting lazier. An argument over dinner that used to take hours to resolve (sometimes it wasn&rsquo;t even resolved that night) can now usually be settled in a couple of minutes by somebody pulling out their smart-phone.</p><h3> The Human Touch                                                                   </h3><p> <br/> And by that I mean exactly that. The human touch. When you call on a prospect you can apply nuances to your voice, you can be compassionate and you can adjust your language.</p><p> Mass messages, even if they are targeted to specific audiences will always be static. Yes, you can add images and videos and animations, but the will never be personal. I get mass emails and messages all day and some of them are more relevant to my business than others, but they are never exactly what I am looking for, because I am one of many to receive them. There is also the trend to over-systematize and sales people rely on technology to help them make a sale rather than picking up the phone and talking to people.</p><h3> Human Persuasion</h3><p> <br/> In sales it is very important to overcome objections and to add value to your customer/client so they buy from you and choose your product or service. Content marketing is important for people to find out about your product/service and to make it easy for customers to find you. It is important to get your message out and to build brand awareness, but it cannot replace human interaction.</p><p> Most people today will research a product/service before they make a buying decision, but I would argue that people still like to buy from people and they will most likely buy from people they trust. Building trust takes time and it is a process that cannot be rushed or replaced by technology.</p><h3> Quality Content</h3><p> <br/> With all the hype about content marketing, we sometimes seem to forget that it&rsquo;s actually content that drives content marketing. Guess who provides content? People! As I am sitting here writing this article I am wondering if there will ever be a technology that will produce quality content. I sure hope not. Not for self serving reasons but for the nuances which human beings can provide. I can&rsquo;t help but think that computer or technology generated content would lack the subtlety of human writing. Who would be able to develop headlines that crown the New York Post (a newspaper that I hardly read beyond the headline) such as &ldquo;Here We Ho Again&rdquo; in response to Eliot Spitzer running for office again. Could a computer really come up with such a clever (although offensive) phrase? And what about sarcasm? I can tell you that I have yet to find a computer program that translates effectively, especially when it comes to humorous phrases or idioms.</p><h3> Rationale</h3><p> <br/> And by that I mean applying logic and knowledge. Let&rsquo;s talk about database management, because to me it&rsquo;s key to effectively engaging with prospects and customers. CRM systems are only as good as the data that is fed into them (which is the truth for all technology enabled solutions). GI-GO &ndash; Garbage in &ndash; garbage out, which brings me to over-systematizing without applying rational thinking and feedback. When managing a database you need to know who your target audience is, whether they are a client, a prospect  or a partner. If you don&rsquo;t tag your contacts properly, your messaging will be off and it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what technology you use.</p><h3> Decision Making</h3><p> <br/> Although, we all think that technology has made it so easy for us to do almost everything by itself, it&rsquo;s really important to remember that making a decision is still something that humans need to do. While technology can help us build an opinion or stay informed, it&rsquo;s still humans who make the decision to buy and people who are signing checks.</p><p> In closing, I want to add that I love technology. I really do. Like most of us, I would be lost without my computer, Smartphone and all the technology solutions that come with it. What we shouldn&rsquo;t forget though is that technology doesn&rsquo;t replace humans. Not yet, anyway and hopefully not any time soon.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 20:04:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 20:04:50.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ldLLKGA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-human-sales-traits-that-technology-cannot-replace/\", \"post_id\": \"6241\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 20:04:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 20:04:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-human-sales-traits-that-technology-cannot-replace\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6240\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2862\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f8bc126e4b4e1643df3012.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"346\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442921400,"author_id":356,"chart_url":""}

Let me take a minute and discuss what to do when you receive one.</p><li> <strong>  Contact them promptly. </strong> It should be obvious and go without saying, but you would be surprised that some advisors receive a name and number from a client and put off contacting them. Your client probably mentioned you because their friend expressed a challenge they were dealing with right now. Don't waste time. Make that phone call a priority.</li><li> <strong>  Ask what they need. </strong> When you reach the referral, after introducing yourself and referencing the client who recommended you, find out what's on their mind. Give them an opportunity to describe what problem they have and what kind of solution they look for. Put the spotlight on them.</li><li> <strong>  Lead with your value proposition. </strong> Once the referral has described their challenge, give them your elevator pitch. You should be in the habit of starting every conversation about your practice with it.</li><li> <strong>  Compare their need to your unique skill. </strong> If things go well, and the referral was sent to you because of the special solution or expertise you represent, it will be clear to the referral that what you do answers the problem they just described.</li><li> <strong>  Set the appointment. </strong> Don't waste time on the phone doing fact gathering or presenting. If you have successfully connected their need to your special skill, the next step is to get together.</li><li> <strong>  Send your client a thank you note. </strong> Express your gratitude for their vote of confidence. Your client takes the risk by sending a friend to you &ndash; honor it. Update them on the status of your conversation without breaching confidences. Let your client know that you spoke to the person that they sent and you have scheduled an appointment, or didn&rsquo;t. Send them a thank you regardless of whether the referral went anywhere or not. My preference is to hand write a card and send by mail. People don't do that very often anymore, so it is much more special than an e-mail. Do it the same day you speak with the referral.</li><li> <strong>  Next time you see the client who sent you the referral </strong> , ask about the circumstances that led to it. It leads your client to relive the situation, and makes it more likely they will make another referral in the same situation. Knowing what the client said will give you valuable information about what the client values and how to teach other clients to do the same. It gives you a chance to confirm that they understand your value proposition and teaches you how they describe it. It enables you to discover a new trigger phrases that prompted your client to refer. <br/>  </li><p> Receiving referrals is more than an opportunity to bring in a new client. It is an opportunity to reward a referror with gratitude. It is an opportunity to learn more about when clients refer, which helps you attract more. It reinforces your differentiator, and drives it further into the clients brain. And all of this helps lead to more referrals.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 20:07:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 20:07:52.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_c1Xl9xr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-to-do-when-you-get-a-referral/\", \"post_id\": \"6243\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 20:07:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 20:07:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-to-do-when-you-get-a-referral\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6242\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2863\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442612636743-35014399b8bc-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"409\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442922300,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}

So you have to be sneaky and do it for them.</p><h3> For those times when people feel like they just have to print something, here are 9 ways to reduce it.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Eliminate personal printers and move to shared printers. </strong>  Remember, each individual printer has to be stocked with ink and paper, as well as maintained.  <u>  That adds up </u> &mdash;as much as 2 cents per page, or $1,000 for every 50,000 pages printed. And  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/257306/how_to_save_money_on_printing_costs.html?page=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   don&rsquo;t tuck the shared printer in a corner  </a> </u> . &ldquo;You can place networked printers near the location of the office manager, or whoever is in charge of maintaining and restocking them,&rdquo; writes Christopher Null in PC World. &ldquo;People who get dirty looks because they&rsquo;re printing too much are likely to self-regulate their usage over time.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Have people print their jobs at the printer itself. </strong> How often do people forget that they&rsquo;ve printed something out and print it again?  <u>  From 10 to 35 percent </u> , according to industry reports. Using a virtual print queue, which means the person is explicitly at the printer before their job is printed, makes sure they&rsquo;re there to retrieve it. (And in the process, you could add a connector to your enterprise content management software to encourage users to scan the document directly into the system instead of printing it out.)</p><p> <strong>  Use printer policies. </strong>  Want to reduce late-night printing, giant print runs (which might be accidents), or heavy use of color? Use printer servers or other printer management controls to limit them. You can even have different policies for people at different levels of the organization.</p><p> <strong>  Change the default setting on all the printers from &ldquo;single-sided&rdquo; to &ldquo;double-sided.&rdquo;  </strong> As Cass Sunstein writes in his book Choosing Not to Choose, people won&rsquo;t necessarily think to  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/manipulating-defaults-for-fun-and-profit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   change the default  </a> </u> , so set it to double-sided. When Rutgers University implemented such a system, it saved them 55 million sheets of paper&mdash;a 44 percent reduction&mdash;in the first three years, while a Swedish university reduced paper use by 15 percent, he reports.  <u>  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5031086/smart-and-easy-ways-to-reduce-printing-costs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Other useful defaults  </a> </u>  are greyscale and draft mode, as well as shrink to fit, Null writes.</p><p> <strong>  Track individual use of printers. </strong> Use managed print services to monitor individual and department use of printers. Now, we&rsquo;re not going to cast any aspersions on people who might be helping manage outside activities, but printer use mysteriously goes down when individual use gets tracked. &ldquo;Most people are shocked to find out their individual cumulative number of copies,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAAahUKEwja9P7S9YDHAhXNlogKHT-oAK0&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.panda.org%2Fdownloads%2Ffinal_paper_saving_tips.pdf&amp;ei=lhS5VdrRB82togS_0ILoCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDz1xz0i4CtWDpyBe8Z\" target=\"_blank\">   writes the World Wildlife Federation  </a> </u>  (WWF). &ldquo;This knowledge will motivate people to reduce their personal paper footprint.&rdquo; If you want to get really tough, implement print quotas.</p><p> <strong>  Use chargeback systems to account for costs.  </strong> Such systems also let you assign costs per printer, so you can attribute low costs to the efficient printers you&rsquo;d like people to use, and higher costs to the expensive printers you don&rsquo;t want them to use.</p><p> <strong>  Reduce margins and typeface sizes. </strong>  Remember in college when you used big margins and fonts to make those ten-page papers less arduous? This is the reverse. Just changing the margins can reduce paper use by up to 14 percent, writes the WWF.</p><p> <strong>  Change fonts to use less ink.  </strong> While you can&rsquo;t expect to  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/saving-370-million-changing-fonts-and-other-fallacies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   save $370 million  </a> </u> , as some have claimed, every drop helps. &ldquo;Century Gothic uses so much less ink than industry-standard Arial that a company printing 250 pages a week would save about $80 a year by doing nothing more than switching fonts,&rdquo; Null writes. &ldquo;The more professional-looking Times New Roman was nearly as cost-effective.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Use thinner paper. </strong>   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/us/news/computing-components/printers-and-scanners/how-to-reduce-your-office-printing-costs-1154836\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Paper comes in different weights  </a> </u> . Who knew? &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel you have to use specialist inkjet or laser paper for day-to-day work,&rdquo; writes Simon Williams in TechRadar Pro. &ldquo;Many cheaper papers work well, including multi-use types, designed to work in both types of printer.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  And please, we beg of you: Don&rsquo;t print this out and hand it around.

{"original_id":2791,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Reasons Why Buyers Now Control the Sale","link":"5-reasons-why-buyers-now-control-the-sale","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Most sales training and advice is based on a fundamental premise: the seller is in control.Think about it: a lot of what's taught focuses on what sellers should be doing to persuade, convince, and drive buyers toward closing a sale. The seller is responsible for bringing the deal to a close. Therefore the seller must be in control.The problem is, things have changed.Sellers aren&rsquo;t in control anymore. Buyers are.This doesn't mean that sellers are relegated to passive accommodation of the whims of the buyer. Rather, it's when sellers understand how buyers buy, they can influence their decisions most effectively.In the last several years I've observed significant changes in buyers and their behavior. If you're out there selling, pay close attention to the following new ingredients in the buying mix.</p><li> <strong>  It's a buyer's market. </strong> As the economic downturn continues (most recently in Brazil and China), companies are keeping a tight leash on costs. \"Lean\" is no longer an initiative. It's the norm.Buyers who run successful organizations are aware of the relative power they hold. Sellers need to get used to the idea that the more powerful the buyer, the higher the competition. Advice for sellers: Develop opportunities proactively through selling with new ideas and perspectives. Move from a demand-driven approach to demand driving. Get out of the \"red ocean\" of competition by developing a strong, differentiated value proposition. <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/3-rules-for-building-a-value-proposition/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Read: 3 Rules for Building a Value Proposition  </a> </u></li><li> <strong>  We've moved from information asymmetry to information parity. </strong> \"Imagine a world not of information asymmetry, but of something closer to information parity, where buyers and sellers have roughly equal access to relevant information. Actually, stop imagining that world. You're living in it.\" - Daniel Pink, To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth about Persuading, Convincing, and Influencing OthersInformation is easy to find. Just ask Google. Researching potential partners is easier than ever before, and the pool is larger (especially in an increasingly globalized world).But it also means that buyers are better informed, and involve sellers later in the process. When they do enter the game, sellers aren't expected to \"sell,\" but to consult with the buyer, who has often already \"defined the problem\" and sketched out scenarios to address it. Advice for sellers: Ramp up the research and prep you perform on your buyers, their situation, industry, and challenges. You need to come across as informed and intelligent when they ask the tough questions. Stop focusing so much on selling. Instead, focus on collaborating with your buyer to develop a solution. Move from diagnosing needs to understanding needs. <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/how-consultative-sales-methods-need-to-change/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Read: How Consultative Sales Methods Need to Change  </a> </u></li><li> <strong>  The bar has risen (for sellers). </strong> Today's buyers expect a lot from sellers, especially those selling high-end B2B products and services. Sellers need to be fluent in all aspects of the sale, from industry trends and knowledge of the buyer's process, to a strong grasp of their products and services vs. the competition.But even that's not enough. Buyers expect today's sellers to  <a href=\"/grow/sales-strategy/how-to-sell-the-most-important-thing-of-all-yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   act more like high-end management consultants than \"traditional salespeople.  </u> </a> Key skills to develop include logic and critical thinking, as the problems and solutions you're working on are more complex than ever. You need to know how to influence high-level executives without holding formal authority. Plus, it's crucial to stay on top of the latest technological and social developments across relevant fields. Advice for sellers: Hone your critical thinking skills, rather than your sales skills. Become a sparring partner for your clients. Act like a trusted advisor. Help them identify the pitfalls in their approach. Reduce complexity by conducting critical analysis and suggesting options. Make it easy to do business with you.</li><li> <strong>  Buyers are teaming up. </strong> The buyer decision process used to be cut and dry. If you were speaking to a senior executive, you could be reasonably sure he or she had the power to pull the trigger on the decision. No more.Today, buyer decisions have three new elements at play that put them in the driver's seat throughout the sales process: empowerment, collaboration, and risk avoidance. <li>  <strong>   Empowerment:  </strong>   Most likely, all of the people you come in contact with at the buying company are both decision makers and constituents. The lines are no longer finely drawn in the sand. 20-somethings hold budget authority and have the ear of the CEO, while that same CEO will ask for input from a broad base of constituents inside the organization. </li> <li>  <strong>   Collaboration:  </strong>   Group sales are now the norm. Decision makers, influencers, key stakeholders, technical experts, and procurement are likely to be involved at various stages of the sale, often together.  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/5-decision-roles-in-every-sale/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Read: 5 Buyer Decision Roles in Every Sale   </a>  </u> </li> <li>  <strong>   Risk avoidance:  </strong>   Individual players are no longer willing to take the brunt of blame for a failed initiative. They are looking to minimize risk on a singular level as well as overall. </li> Advice for sellers: Expect to be selling to multiple individuals, and expect sales cycles to be longer. Adopt a collaborative process from the start, and be inclusive of additional players rather than seeing them as a hindrance. Bring up the notion of risk proactively, and demonstrate how you&rsquo;ll help manage and mitigate it.</li><li> <strong>  There's more competition than ever. </strong> In my first two points, I addressed how reduced direct corporate investment and the move towards information parity, respectively, have increased the number of direct competitors for each opportunity.But forget about direct competition: what about indirect?Every single day, new business models arise that provide attractive alternatives to your products and services. Executive search firms, for example, face competition not just from other search firms but also from job aggregators, alumni referral networks, boutique LD firms, and \"all-around\" HR services firms.The rise of technology coupled with the advance of new business models means more competition from both traditional players as well as \"upstarts.\" There is constant movement in the market, both up (e.g. new premium offers) and down (e.g. lower-cost, semi-automated services). Advice for sellers: When evaluating your competition, don't just consider the \"usual suspects.\" Chances are, your buyers see valuable alternatives you don't even know exist. Be sure to ask buyers not just about who they see as your direct competitors, but also what alternatives are out there (including \"doing nothing\").</li>These are only five of the reasons why many sellers are finding themselves in the backseat of the sale, traditional techniques no longer working.Within every challenge lies an opportunity. Today's successful sellers are smart. They cultivate a deep knowledge of the market their buyers operate in, and use it to guide buyers through the sales process to the win.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 20:28:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 20:28:57.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_j2XcdVA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-reasons-why-buyers-now-control-the-sale/\", \"post_id\": \"6247\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 20:28:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 20:28:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-reasons-why-buyers-now-control-the-sale\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6246\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2865\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442596166706-e89c2a5421a5-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"444\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442943900,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}

The business of selling now requires you to work multi-dimensionally and embrace the digital space by implementing social selling.

What is different with the inclusion of social selling, is the approach and thought process</p><p> With social selling, you need to rethink how you define, discover and engage with clients and prospects. You need to meet them on a different level, or social space, before many of them will even let you make in-person contact. Consider these numbers from Sales Benchmark Index:</p><li> You are almost five times more apt to schedule a first meeting if you have a personal LinkedIn connection.</li><li> Some 98 percent of sales reps with over 5,000 LinkedIn connections achieve quota. <br/>  </li><p> Those are pretty staggering numbers! And, your work doesn&rsquo;t stop with the sale; you must continue to incorporate social selling with constant, quality contact to keep and win new business.</p><p> I love a good board game now and then, but when it comes to business in the real world, it&rsquo;s not about who can make it to &ldquo;Go&rdquo; first; it&rsquo;s who can best utilize the digital arena to find and build connections, and then grow that business day in and day out.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-21 20:35:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-21 20:35:15.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_4Cb7uQ5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-are-you-ready-for-social-selling/\", \"post_id\": \"6249\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-21 20:35:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-21 20:35:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-are-you-ready-for-social-selling\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6250\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2866\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"422\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442930400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

That's what I am going to cover on this video.<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jTcwZR4ePPU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"363\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-22-at-7.41.40-AM-2.png\" width=\"625\"/></a>Before I get into the details, let me give you a little bit of background.You see, I believe that most advisors already know all the people that they need to know to be able to grow their businesses.Whether it&rsquo;s growing the business directly with those people or those people introducing them to prospective clients. I think you already know who these people are or have a quick way to get access to them.They really come in 3 different places. Let me go through them one at a time.First of all, many advisors have more clients than they&rsquo;re currently servicing on a regular basis.That&rsquo;s a mistake for lots of different reasons, but in this particular case, it&rsquo;s an opportunity for determining if some of those lower tier clients have the potential to move up scale.<h3> They may have the potential to be an ultimate client for your business.</h3>You see, you probably have clients on your books that for whatever reason, you haven&rsquo;t gotten deep into that relationship and they may have the potential to be an ultimate client of your business.It&rsquo;s incumbent on you to re-profile those lower tier clients.I talk about this a lot in my book, Delivering the Ultimate Client Experience, but that&rsquo;s one place that you can turn clients into bigger clients, get in front of them quickly and create some good results for your business.A second place that you can go is into your current list of prospects.Again, most advisors have a very unorganized way of keeping up with prospective clients. You may have a CRM system but it&rsquo;s not up to date.You may have a spreadsheet or a legal pad or a pile of business cards. They come in lots of different formats, but you haven&rsquo;t organized them.You haven&rsquo;t stayed up with them. Every time you go through the list, you think, &ldquo;Oh, gosh. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with this person.&rdquo;The fact of the matter is you could probably just call them, remind them of the introduction that you had and get in front of them over the next couple of weeks and they could be prospective clients of your practice.<h3> It&rsquo;s just a matter of organizing the gems that are already in that database, that list of prospects that you already have.</h3>The third place I would recommend that you go is to people that you know, you believe you would like to do business with but for whatever reason, they&rsquo;re not working with you and you haven&rsquo;t approached them or maybe even talked to them about doing business with you.Face it. They may not really know what you do or that you&rsquo;re even open for new business.Just because your practice accepts new clients on a regular basis doesn&rsquo;t mean that the people that you come in contact with on a daily basis understand how you work.Make a list of people that you know that you think would be good prospects, good clients, future clients of your business and get in front of them.If you spent a little bit of time organizing that lower tier client list, that client database, that list of people that you know, you have a lot of people that you could call on, have appointments with and really get the momentum going.Of course, there are other ways to do it too but those are 3 great ways that you could start today and begin seeing results very, very quickly.It&rsquo;s part of the process that I encourage advisors to do is I help them simplify their business. I think sometimes, we want to overcomplicate what we do.That&rsquo;s why I would encourage you to click the<a href=\"https://encorepartners.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  here </u></a>so you can get your copy of The Simplicity Pledge.It&rsquo;s full of great time hacks, ways that you can get more done in less time and increase your profitability while having more fun along the way.I hope you&rsquo;ll join me.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 14:33:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 14:33:21.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_8V1t0vN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-in-front-of-more-prospects/\", \"post_id\": \"6253\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 14:33:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 14:33:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-in-front-of-more-prospects\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6251\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2867\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-20-at-8.29.59-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"654\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443036000,"author_id":403,"chart_url":""}

As a manager, you need to find out what tools or resources your workers are lacking, or perhaps what changes in management style need to be made to be more effective. If you want to find out what you can do to keep your staff engaged, all you need to do is ask your employees.</p><p> Asking these straightforward questions will give you an idea of what your employees need to be more effective at work:</p><h3> &ldquo;How would you like to be rewarded?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> As a manager, you may not always understand and know what your employees really want. On the other hand, when you allow them to spell it for you, you will know exactly what it is that can motivate them. By upgrading your reward system to include flexi hours, dress-down days, or even a quarterly company outing, your employees will have more reasons to work harder and become more productive.</p><h3> &ldquo;What can make you work best?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Depending on your company and its work environment, it is likely that you won&rsquo;t be able to accommodate all your workers&rsquo; request. But by knowing what things can make your workers be more efficient in their jobs, you may at least make small changes to the workplace. Perhaps you may allow them to work from home once a week, or you may provide free snacks from time to time. If the request is minimal and within your capacity to provide, you should make your workers feel that you sincerely care about their needs.</p><h3> &ldquo;What part of my management style do you like and dislike?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The bravest thing you can do as a manager is to practically ask your workers what they like and dislike about your management style. It would require a lot of courage on your part, but when you hear the opinions of your employees, you will have a better idea of how effective you are as a manager. Although there are annual performance reviews you can take to gauge your performance, it is still different when you hear it straight from the people you are managing.</p><p> To make this strategy work, you need to be open-minded and ready to hear what you don&rsquo;t want to hear. Some of your employees may have something bad to say about you, but remember that you are doing this to become a better leader.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/what-is-mentoring/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   If you want to be a more effective manager  </a> </u> , you should stop guessing what could make your employees more engaged and productive at work.

We tried and got 99 million. That&rsquo;s a lot of secrets. So how do you know which ones you absolutely, positively need to know in order to be successful in business?</p><p> Given that the definition of a secret is something not very many people know, we suspected that pretty much all of these so-called secrets were simply business tips that had been labelled as &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; to get our attention. We also suspected they had been repackaged to appear different from the tips they&rsquo;re copied from. And we assumed that if they had been repackaged, we could unpackage them and sort them into common categories. Surely, we reasoned, the more business tips we found of a certain category, the more important that type of tip was likely to be?</p><p> We tested this by going through the first two pages of our Google search. We sorted the tips we found into common categories. For example, tips such as &ldquo;clarity of vision&rdquo;, &ldquo;definiteness of purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;clear direction&rdquo; were all placed in the &ldquo;Vision/Clarity&rdquo; category.</p><p> In this way we were able to condense the total number of tips, but we had expected to be able to reduce that number to maybe ten. Instead, we could only get it down to 28. There was everything from Customer Relationships, Motivation and Team Building to Innovation, Values and Leadership.  </p><h3> Confused? We were.</h3><p> <br/> So we turned to the experts. Well-known business gurus like Richard Branson, Brian Tracy, Phillip Kotler, Steve Collis, Jack Welsh and Bill Gates. What was their number 1 business success secret?</p><p> Richard Branson said Passion. Brian Tracy, the personal and professional development trainer, said Clarity. Phillip Kotler, the marketing guru, said Being Different. Steve Collis, President and CEO of AmerisourceBergen, said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not how you start the race, it&rsquo;s how you finish it.&rdquo; We guessed he was talking about Commitment and Persistence. Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of General Electric, said Candour.</p><p> Not a lot of consistency in the secrets so far. But it was Bill Gates, the world&rsquo;s richest and nicest man, who really threw a spanner in the works when he talked about his favourite business book, Business Adventures.  </p><p> &ldquo;Unlike a lot of today&rsquo;s business writers, Brooks didn&rsquo;t boil his work down into pat how-to lessons or simplistic explanations for success. (How many times have you read that some company is taking off because they give their employees free lunch?) You won&rsquo;t find any listicles in his work. Brooks wrote long articles that frame an issue, explore it in depth, introduce a few compelling characters, and show how things went for them.&rdquo;</p><h3> Listicles? What the&hellip;? </h3><p> <br/> Maybe we should have stopped writing this article at this point. But we decided to take Steve Collis&rsquo;s advice and finish the race. And we also decided to take Bill Gates&rsquo; advice and make this article longer than we intended and far more in-depth.</p><p> Our own view is that one of the secrets of business success is to look at how others have achieved success and then pull out and apply the bits that you think will work for you. Sometimes, though, we&rsquo;ve found the real secrets aren&rsquo;t immediately obvious and you have to read between the lines to find them.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example of what we mean. </p><p> The other day, we were looking through a Slideshare entitled \"How to build a $5 million company in 10 steps\". As we flicked through, we couldn&rsquo;t help but pick up some tidbits that weren&rsquo;t immediately obvious.</p><h3> 1. Find Trustworthy Partners </h3><p> <br/> In our experience, success in business often depends on the leader &ndash; and in particular, how driven the leader is to succeed. In this case, the business is owned by a husband and wife team, but we note the husband produces the Slideshares and the wife is the CEO*.</p><p> <strong>  REAL SUCCESS SECRET #1: </strong> Drive the business or marry someone who will</p><h3> 2. Create a Strategy &amp; Focus</h3><p> <br/> We take it Verne Harnish is some kind of business guru but his &ldquo;1-page strategic plan&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any strategy in it. We&rsquo;ve explained elsewhere that strategy is different from vision, mission, goals, priorities, and plans. It&rsquo;s about how an organisation creates, delivers, and captures value, first for the customer and then for the company.  </p><p> <strong>  REAL SUCCESS SECRET #2: </strong> Start with a real strategy that focuses on customer value</p><h3> 3. Say No to What's Off Focus </h3><p> <br/> We couldn&rsquo;t agree more with the need for a laser-like focus and that sometimes that means having to fire customers. But we really, really hope that the logo shown doesn&rsquo;t belong to one of the customers they&rsquo;ve fired.</p><p> <strong>  REAL SUCCESS SECRET #3: </strong> Say no to what&rsquo;s off focus but don&rsquo;t brag about the customers you&rsquo;ve fired </p><h3> 4. It's the People Stupid</h3><p> <br/> Yes, it is the people &ndash; especially in a service business like this one (a social media agency). But if people are the most important success factor in this business, why are they are No. 10? And what&rsquo;s the significance of all the big-name brands on this slide?</p><p> <strong>  REAL SUCCESS SECRET #4: </strong> Yes, it&rsquo;s the people, but they need leadership, clear strategy, focus and culture to help them succeed</p><h3> 5. Form a Board of Advisors</h3><p> <br/> Not enough small business owners do this, but we&rsquo;ve never come across a business this size with so many advisors (we count eight, not including the owners). Do the owners really need all that advice? Do they ever get around to actually making a decision? And why does the average age of their advisors appear to be 87 when the average age of their employees (see above) is 12?</p><p> <strong>  REAL SUCCESS SECRET #5: </strong> Seek outside counsel but don&rsquo;t let it slow down your decision process</p><h3> 6. Build Your Brand</h3><p> <br/> Not enough small businesses do enough brand building, but that&rsquo;s not something you can say about this company. So many digital marketing agencies have such wanky names. I mean &lsquo;Razorfish&rsquo;, &lsquo;Victors and Spoils&rsquo;, &lsquo;Firstborn&rsquo; &ndash; please! &lsquo;Likeable&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t like any of these. And whether or not you find the orange &lsquo;like&rsquo; symbol likeable (we&rsquo;re not going to tell you what we think), at least it&rsquo;s simple, clear and positive.</p><p> <strong>  REAL SUCCESS SECRET #6: </strong> Build your brand as an extension of your strategy, values and people</p><p> We think that if you can look past that sunburned and disembodied hand, this sentence from Likeable&rsquo;s home page goes some way to explaining the real secret of their success. At least it speaks to the customer. It makes two promises that the customer may value: getting results and providing convenience.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 15:22:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 15:22:18.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_5xEjbAg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/if-youre-looking-for-the-real-secrets-of-business-success-dont-listen-to-the-experts/\", \"post_id\": \"6257\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 15:22:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 15:22:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"if-youre-looking-for-the-real-secrets-of-business-success-dont-listen-to-the-experts\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6256\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2869\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-22-at-8.30.52-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"396\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443011400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2796,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Do So Many Women Choose Different Paths?","link":"why-do-so-many-women-choose-different-paths","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  Lisa Shelley </u> | <a href=\"http://www.essentialimited.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Essentia Limited  </u> </a></p><p> In large corporations, women continue to be under-represented in executive leadership roles, with many self-selecting out of the running for these jobs by mid-career. What can we learn from this continuing trend? Could it be a call to re-evaluate the corporate culture and potentially even how businesses are managed?</p><h3> The dominant paradigm of today is that the primary purpose of business is to maximize value to the shareholder.</h3><p> <br/> This thinking is often coupled with the view that the value available to distribute within a business ecosystem is limited, and therefore, to meet the short-term demand of value to the shareholder, it is necessary and acceptable to trade-off value from another stakeholder &ndash; such as the employee, customer, supplier or partner. In its extreme, this model of business can drive short-term thinking, cannibalize the viability of the other business stakeholders and put the long-term sustainability of the business system in question. It can result in a resource-lean environment that challenges the ability to get things done, encourage competition over collaboration, and leave little white space in which to foster innovation.</p><p> Are women simply rejecting this model of business and the often fear-based, competitive, 24/7 culture that it creates? I&rsquo;ve written before that women tend to view their careers from a different lens: they tend to define success differently than men, and they feel more freedom to choose a different path. These differences offer insight into their choices.</p><p> Men tend to define success as hitting the target &ndash; winning in some fashion. Making trade-offs in order to achieve a target is a generally accepted approach to life. Women are far more committed to living a multi-dimensional life, encompassing career, family, friends and other interests. They prefer a collaborative and open work environment, and are more motivated by the need for meaning and to make an impact, than just by financial reward. In short, many women do not find the experience of executive leadership in a traditional corporate culture to be worth the necessary sacrifices.</p><h3> Women at the same time feel more freedom to choose a different path.</h3><p> <br/> They are more willing to challenge the status quo, and when they don&rsquo;t feel their perspective is valued, they feel less pressure to conform. They do not feel the same societal expectations to follow the traditional corporate ladder path to success, and as a result feel free to choose differently.</p><p> Of course, this discussion of the differences between &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women&rdquo; is based on generalities. Women are certainly not the first and only contingent of leaders to question the current business paradigm and culture. However, maybe women&rsquo;s choices are more visible? They are a distinct demographic, rendering visible a trend which has certainly been in place over time.</p><p> So, what are the potential implications of this trend? For businesses operating within the traditional paradigm, one of two things will likely happen. For some businesses, the visibility of this trend may highlight the need to question the current business culture and the business model behind it, hopefully prompting change.</p><p> However, for many businesses, the attachment to the current business paradigm may run too deep to see its frailties. They will continue to operate in this model, squeezing as much margin as possible from the system. They likely won&rsquo;t recognize the erosion of their talent, their inability to innovate, their hostile partner relationships, their poor supplier quality and their unhappy customers until it is too late.</p><p> Thankfully, that&rsquo;s not the end of the story; it&rsquo;s simply a new beginning. The most significant implication of this trend may be that many of the women who have chosen differently, along with the heretics who came before them and the millennial leaders just beginning their careers today, are actively building new businesses. Businesses which operate according to a new set of rules, based on purpose and the recognition that value provided to employees, customers, partners, suppliers &ndash; society &not;&ndash; is the only sustainable way to provide long-term value to investors and facilitate the overall growth of the system.</p><p> These new businesses are quietly proving to the world the validity of a new model&hellip; they are the future of business, and it&rsquo;s looking bright.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 15:38:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 15:38:13.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_rGgXrUf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-do-so-many-women-choose-different-paths/\", \"post_id\": \"6259\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 15:38:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 15:38:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-do-so-many-women-choose-different-paths\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6258\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2870\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-22-at-8.43.41-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"308\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443031200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Only recently have they begun to take notice of the difference in how men and women approach the topic of money.</p><h3> Enter a new opportunity: Financial Coaching for Women.</h3><p> <br/> With ninety-two percent of women feeling eager to learn more about financial planning, and eighty-three percent of women wanting to get more involved in their finances, as the study cites, I believe more programs offering financial coaching for women would support them in exploring and openly discussing money matters in a safe, non-threatening environment.</p><p> This would help women increase their level of financial literacy, and therefore their confidence. Then perhaps they wouldn&rsquo;t feel so reluctant to discuss money, or even invest it, with a financial advisor.</p><p> When it comes to the world of finance and investing, business as usual cannot be tolerated if investment companies want to capture any portion of the 22 trillion dollars that women are projected to control by the year 2020.[1] The good-old-boys-club mentality is antiquarian in today&rsquo;s reality of the rising economic force of women.</p><p> Attention: Financial institutions, investment and insurance companies and banks. Enough with the women and money studies already. You should know by now what women want and need. It&rsquo;s time to start catering to the other gender.</p><p> <strong>  As the Fidelity study discovered: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Women believe that they need more in-depth understanding and experience with the investment process to feel confident that they are making the right choices for themselves and their families. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Nearly 60 percent of women expressed financial anxiety about saving enough money for a comfortable retirement. </strong></li><p> This represents a huge opportunity for those financial professionals who truly care about the financial wellbeing of both men and women, and not just about racking up high fees and commissions.</p><p> It&rsquo;s time to consider implementing methodologies and processes &ndash; such as Financial Coaching &ndash; that can accommodate the unique needs of female investors.</p><p> Women reported that having more support would encourage them to become more involved in their finances, because they would feel more knowledgeable about their options. Additionally, seventy percent of women not currently working with a financial professional would feel encouraged to do so in the future, if they did feel supported.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s really not that difficult to understand. You see, it&rsquo;s a lot like dating.</h3><p> <br/> Women need to be courted, and in the process of courting &ndash; where finances are concerned &ndash; they need to be educated and feel supported.</p><p> So to you, conglomerates in the financial services industry, I say it&rsquo;s time to wake up and smell the pink roses! Make financial coaching a preliminary step in the financial planning process, and you will attract more female clients than you can possibly handle.</p>[1] US Census Current Population Survey, 2012","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 15:53:28.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 15:53:28.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_902xxjD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-the-financial-industry-needs-to-offer-coaching-for-women/\", \"post_id\": \"6261\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 15:53:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 15:53:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-the-financial-industry-needs-to-offer-coaching-for-women\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6260\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2871\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-22-at-9.04.58-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"558\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443008700,"author_id":375,"chart_url":""}

A retro behavior occurring on a modern channel.</p><p> A letter to my future husband, a letter to my future wife, a letter to my future daughter, a letter to my future self.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve read any of these you know that these letters are reflections on past behavior, a collection of lessons learned, and a set of expectations for future action. My kids completed another school year and one of their last projects was to compile a reflection journal on the school year. It was a nice way to celebrate all they learned and provide perspective on the coming school year.</p><p> I&rsquo;m wrapping up year 2 with my employer and of course this means appraisal time. Aside from listing and scoring accomplishments, the appraisal encourages you to reflect on the past year and plan for the year ahead.

I&rsquo;m looking for opportunity to further my education, experience, and expertise.</p><p> Encourage me to embrace projects outside of my comfort zone. I fear complacency but also fear a lack of expertise.</p><p> I may appear that I go with the flow, but please know that I&rsquo;m dependent on checklists and schedules and I&rsquo;m secretly imploding when change occurs.</p><p> If my patience appears short or I sound exasperated it&rsquo;s not because I dislike my work, I just need to go for a run.</p><p> I want to be appreciated but public accolades make me feel uncomfortable.</p><p> I&rsquo;m extremely sarcastic, find therapy in laughter, and hate anything related to graphic design. Please don&rsquo;t make me design.</p><p> I&rsquo;m obnoxiously competitive with others and myself.

The program has helped over 500 aspiring and experienced entrepreneurs transform their business ideas into reality. In addition to classes, the Build Institute offers networking events, mentorship opportunities, and resources all with the goal of nurturing the Detroit community.</p><h3> Investors </h3><p> <br/> Alongside entrepreneurs, investors are heading toward the city in droves.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/magazine/the-post-post-apocalyptic-detroit.html?_r=2\" target=\"_blank\">   The New York Times  </a> </u>  discloses that of Detroit&rsquo;s 380,000 original properties, 114,000 have been razed, and another 80,000 are considered in need of demolition. <strong>  This leaves a wide-open playing field for investors and capitalists to add their money to the city and watch it grow. </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://detroitventurepartners.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Detroit Venture Partners  </a> </u>  is one such example. Their approach has been to back early stage start-up teams with grit, creativity, and passion for those who are looking for new opportunity. Since their founding, they&rsquo;ve backed 70 start-ups in Detroit&rsquo;s Downtown tech ecosystem.</p><p> Another player in the investment field is the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.degc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Detroit Economic Growth Corporation  </a> </u> ; dedicated to supporting existing businesses and garnering new city investments. Their mission is to bring together public sector policies with private sector investments to strength downtown Detroit.</p><h3> Local Retail and Restaurants</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Since 2013, 77 new restaurants and 41 new retail locations have opened in downtown Detroit </strong> , according to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://detroitsevenpointtwo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   7.2 SQ MI  </a> </u>  report. The city&rsquo;s small businesses are building the backbone of the new Detroit and revitalizing otherwise dead neighborhoods. These restaurants and retail stores are in direct response to the almost 3,000 new housing units built and renovated between 2010-2014, according to the same 7.2 SQ MI report.</p><p> Unique to Detroit, many of the retail stores and restaurants are not found in new buildings, but in renovated old buildings.  <u>  <a href=\"http://thespaces.com/2015/07/13/revitalising-detroit-a-dish-at-a-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Spaces  </a> </u>  looks at two examples:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.republictaverndetroit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Republic Tavern  </a> </u>  and Parks &amp; Rec.</p><p> These two new restaurants in downtown Detroit used refurbished heritage buildings. By using previously vacant buildings, small businesses are getting a larger bang for their buck while updating city streets at the same time.</p><h3> Tech Start-ups</h3><p> <br/> Also finding a new home in Detroit are tech start-ups. Silicon Valley used to be the place to be, but when the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/03/wisely-midwest-app_n_4473715.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Huffington Post  </a> </u>  interviewed Mike Vichich, the founder of  <u>  Wisely </u> , he claimed that it just makes sense to grow a tech startup in the Midwest. <strong>  Young developers in Detroit are just as adept as West Coast talent, but they&rsquo;re more affordable, as are other professional services and office space options. </strong></p><p> Many tech start-ups tend to agree with Vichich. Over 100 start-ups have made Detroit their home, including  <u>  <a href=\"http://areyouahuman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Are You A Human?  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stik.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stik  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://hashgr.am/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hashgram  </a> </u> . Even large corporations like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/about/company/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google  </a> </u>  have recognized the opportunities available in Detroit. Google recently named Detroit as part of its Tech Hub Network, one of seven tech centers around the country who will receive investments and help from the giant, according to the  <u>  Detroit Free Press </u> .</p><h3> Environmental Philanthropy</h3><p> <br/> As evidenced already, <strong>  there&rsquo;s an abounding love for Detroit </strong> , which is why a lot of the new business is about clean living and cleaning up the city.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hantzfarmsdetroit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Hantz  </a> </u> , a Detroit-area tycoon, has made it his mission to transform Detroit into a city with reclaimed parks, mixed-green communities, retention ponds, and community gardens. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/magazine/the-post-post-apocalyptic-detroit.html?_r=2\" target=\"_blank\">   New York Times  </a> </u>  reveals that Hantz has cleared 150 acres for tree farms and has planted 15,000 sugar maples, white birch, oak, and burr trees.</p><p> Beyond Hantz, many other organizations desiring a clean, safe, and inviting Detroit have popped up.  <u>  <a href=\"http://greengaragedetroit.com/index.php?title=Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Green Garage  </a> </u>  opened in 2011 and has worked to transform Detroit businesses into environmentally and socially accountable companies. Another program is  <u>  <a href=\"http://downtowndetroit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Downtown Detroit Partnership  </a> </u> , which advocates and develops programs to transform downtown Detroit into a beautiful and vibrant area. The end goal of these businesses is to make Detroit an even more attractive city to work and live.</p><h3> Tourism</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s never a better time to visit Detroit. It&rsquo;s affordable and bustling with new life. That&rsquo;s why businesses such as the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.weknowdetroit.org/#dxf-welcome\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Detroit Experience Factory  </a> </u>  are gaining speed. With all the new restaurants, retail stores, and start-ups around the city, a guided tour is exactly what every tourist needs. And less you think that people aren&rsquo;t interested in visiting Detroit, according to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWzFwq9-c50&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hotels.com and SeatGeek  </a> </u>  Detroit is ranked the number two best American city for sports travel. </p><p> The revitalization of Detroit offers an interesting case study. If a city billions of dollars in debt and on the brink of ruin can become a new business powerhouse, what can happen in cities with far fewer barriers to overcome? Or is Detroit unique? For now, it seems that the hustle and bustle of the new Detroit has only just begun. <strong>  And as entrepreneurs and investors continue to flock to the Motor City bringing money and new business ideas, there&rsquo;s no telling what type of city Detroit will become in a few years time. One thing, it's great to see that the American spirit is alive and well and that you can't keep a good city down.  </strong></p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 17:02:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 17:02:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_yMx6zor.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-post-recession-detroit-is-the-new-it-city/\", \"post_id\": \"6265\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 17:02:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 17:02:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-post-recession-detroit-is-the-new-it-city\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6264\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2873\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-22-at-10.25.09-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"532\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443006000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2800,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Chatting With Chipotle's CEO | Character — Part II","link":"chatting-with-chipotles-ceo-character-part-ii","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Monty Moran, co-CEO of Chipotle, talks to Sarah K Asaftei about core values &amp; leadership. </strong></p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Tell me more about your Restaurateur Culture.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> I believe the general manager position is the most important position in Chipotle, period. Because GMs hire 99.9% of our people. They decide who comes in the door and who doesn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re either effective at developing people into future leaders, or not. They have complete ownership over our customer experience, which is what drives our success.</p><p> So the manager is the most important position in the company, but when I came on board we didn&rsquo;t treat them that way. Most of our managers wanted to move up to an area manager position, where they leave the restaurant and oversee half a dozen restaurants. This promoted the very best managers, who were the most effective in creating a great restaurant experience and hiring people, right out of the restaurant.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Hmm.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> So I said, &ldquo;Look, I want the gravity in this company, the job everyone wants, to be the general manager level, not greater. I want them to be the heroes; I want everyone to want to be a great general manager.&rdquo;</p><p> But in order to promote that content, I had to create a new name for the general managers who manage in an enlightened way. I called them restaurateurs. As the most important position in the whole company, I personally interview every single one of them for this job. Every manager of the company who becomes a restaurateur gets it because one of the CEOs gave it to him. People thought I was crazy. But we did it.</p><p> I was looking for specific things in each candidate. To be a Chipotle restaurateur, this elite general manager position, you must have a team of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards. So, there&rsquo;s three criteria: top performers, empowerment, and high standards.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> High standards are a throwaway because if you have top performers who are empowered with the right kind of knowledge, high standards are gonna fall out the bottom like a vending machine.</p><p> So the real focus is on building a crew of all top performers. How do you do that? First, you hire crew with the 13 characteristics. Second, you teach them to believe that the path to success is to make the people around them better. A top performer is someone who has the desire and ability to perform excellent work and through their constant effort to do so, elevates themselves, the people around themselves, and Chipotle.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Hmm.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> So there are kind of two pieces to the definition. Number one, you do a great job. Number two, you make others better. That&rsquo;s to break it down. Do great work and make others better.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> So at Chipotle, doing a great job doesn&rsquo;t make you a top performer, that&rsquo;s not enough. You have to do a good job and make others better, and do it all of the time.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> So it can&rsquo;t be just you, it has to be you and the people around you.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> Empowerment is a feeling when you are confident in your ability and encouraged by your circumstances so that you feel motivated and at liberty to fully devote your talent to a purpose.</p><p> That&rsquo;s a lot of words, but it is simple:</p><p>   <strong>  A) Confident in your ability, </strong></p><p> <strong>   B) Encouraged by your circumstances. </strong></p><p> Confident in your ability just means you know how to do your job, and you&rsquo;ve been trained properly.</p><p> The harder part of empowerment is: how do you create encouraging circumstances for people? You feel encouraged by your circumstances when you have a vision you believe in. In other words, when you know where you want to go.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> You have to have a deeper why.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> Yeah, and a great leader cares about you, challenges you, believes in you, trusts you, wants you to do better, loves you, and is committed to making you the very best you can be.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Being at your best is a key part of that &mdash; because allowing mediocrity and complacency is not consistent with helping you gain confidence. Increased confidence comes from conquering new things that you didn&rsquo;t think you could do but now you can.</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> Absolutely! You feel at liberty to fully devote your talents to a purpose.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> Do you share those 13 core characteristics or is that proprietary?</p><p> <strong>  MONTY: </strong> I don&rsquo;t keep it a great secret. They include being: smart, infectiously enthusiastic, polite, hospitable, respectful, happy, motivated, ambitious, presentable, curious, honest, let&rsquo;s see&hellip;hospitable, maybe I already said that. These are communicable characteristics you can instantly identify in a two-minute interview with someone.</p><p> <strong>  SARAH: </strong> And those are things people either have or they don&rsquo;t.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 17:46:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 17:46:15.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Lp31jr2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/chatting-with-chipotles-ceo-character-part-ii/\", \"post_id\": \"6267\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 17:46:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 17:46:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"chatting-with-chipotles-ceo-character-part-ii\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6266\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2874\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-22-at-10.46.55-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1079\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1442995200,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2801,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Finding Common Ground and a Path to Forgiveness","link":"finding-common-ground-and-a-path-to-forgiveness","source_link":null,"content":"<p> On Sunday evening, the Jewish community celebrated  <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/holidays/rosh-hashanah-guide-for-the-perplexed-2015/2015/09/11/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Rosh Hashanah   </a>  </u> </strong> , the Jewish New Year. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the holiday, there&rsquo;s much more to it than a typical New Years Eve. There&rsquo;s no ball dropping on Times Square, and while it is a celebration, the focus is on family and faith and renewal for the coming year.  <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur\" target=\"_blank\">    Yom Kippur   </a>  </u> </strong> , the Day of Atonement, begins at sunset next Tuesday, and the days in between&mdash;The Days of Awe&mdash;are a time of reflection and forgiveness with the hope of starting fresh for the coming year.</p><h3> As you can imagine, these holidays have me thinking a lot about forgiveness.</h3><p> <br/> In my work as a financial advisor, I do quite a bit of mediation with couples (I&rsquo;m trained in mediation as well as financial planning), and in that process I witness a lot of challenges as couples work together to overcome money issues that are causing conflict in their lives. In almost every instance&mdash;whether I&rsquo;m working with a couple alone or along with their extended family&mdash;I see amazing shifts take place as individuals face their conflicts, seek common ground, and find new ways to communicate more effectively with each other.</p><p> Tamara and Chris have been clients of mine for years. After working with them to mediate some financial issues over a decade ago, Tamara&rsquo;s favorite saying was, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t fight about money anymore&hellip;we just call Lauren!&rdquo; Unfortunately, they had some pretty big financial hits recently: Chris was forced to take an unexpected early retirement, and Tamara&rsquo;s business fell on tough times. Without much warning, they had to completely rethink their financial future&mdash;which included making some major decisions about how to decrease their monthly expenses.</p><p> At first, they both fell into the old trap of the blame game. &ldquo;Chris promised me we would stay in our home through retirement,&rdquo; cried Tamara. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re in this situation at this point in our lives.&rdquo; Then Chris chimed in, saying that if Tamara had taken better marketing advice, her business would not have failed. They were angry at each other for the situation they were in, but it was easy to see that their anger was rooted in fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of change. And fear of being judged by each other. They weren&rsquo;t exactly fighting about money, but they clearly weren&rsquo;t in harmony either.</p><p> To help get them there, I asked them each to share their vision of the future&mdash;regardless of their financial situation. As they talked, we found that neither of them wanted to have to rebuild a career at this point in their lives, so they were both ready to retire. Next, we talked about what retirement looked like to each of them. Family and outdoor activities made the top of the list. And they both saw themselves walking together a lot&mdash;in nature, to the market, to dinner&mdash;all without getting in a car. In very little time, they had found some common ground, and the decisions that had felt so overwhelming were suddenly so much easier. By the time they left my office (with homework!), I could tell they had begun to paint a joint vision of what their new life would be like together. Harmony was on its way.</p><h3> Tamara and Chris aren&rsquo;t alone.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  So often in families, fear has a knack for causing conflict, even if it seems everyone is fighting over money. </strong> We all know stories about families torn apart after a loved one dies because of fights over belongings and money. And just like Tamara and Chris, it seems much of the upset&mdash;and the resulting need for forgiveness!&mdash;is often caused not by need, (Does Linda really need her grandmother&rsquo;s candlesticks? Does Jerry really need his father&rsquo;s car?) but by an emotional reaction to what&rsquo;s happening, including sadness, fear, guilt, and more.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-robin-williams-legal-battle-20150601-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The legal battle over Robin Williams&rsquo; estate  </a> </u>  is a perfect example. Robin&rsquo;s death was unexpected, and while he had done some pretty detailed estate planning, it wasn&rsquo;t detailed enough to prevent a sad fight between his wife of three years and his adult children. Many blame the lawyers for the lack of clarity, but as with most disagreements, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if things would have been different if he had just communicated better when it came to his wishes. Not in legal documents, but with his wife and adult children. They&rsquo;re still in mediation today. When all is said and done, they may all need to ask for&mdash;and offer&mdash;forgiveness.</p><p> Whether disagreements are about money, relationships, rethinking retirement, or myriad other issues, finding common ground and communicating clearly can not only help dissolve issues, but can often help sidestep conflict in the first place. Jewish or not, the &ldquo;Days of Awe&rdquo; are a great time to reflect on the fences in your life that may need mending. Perhaps take that step and ask someone for forgiveness. Or better yet, actively seek some common ground and communicate with your loved ones to prepare for your own fresh start. I know that&rsquo;s my goal for the week.</p><p> No matter what your faith, I wish you a Happy New Year 5776 filled with peace, health, happiness, and prosperity.

So, why should you care as an advisor? Well, have you ever walked into a meeting with a client and been put on the spot because your client read something online, pertinent to your business, and spent time trying to correct the conclusion they came to by reading that article? Buyers are becoming more knowledgeable and it&rsquo;s re-shaping the role of sales and marketing professionals.  Understanding the buyer journey can help you adapt to these changes.</p><p> So, just what is the Buyer Journey? A buyer journey consists of the mental stages a buyer experiences before making the purchase of a product or a service. In the financial or insurance advice space, this could be a mutual fund, a specific investment strategy, life insurance premium amounts and so on. There are 3 key stages: Awareness, Consideration and Decision. Let&rsquo;s take a look at each one:</p><h3> Awareness</h3><p> <br/> This stage isn&rsquo;t about the awareness of your product or service. The title refers to the awareness of a problem that your buyer is experiencing. For example, let&rsquo;s say you notice your child&rsquo;s temperature is very high and experiencing severe stomach pain or, perhaps your client is noticing that their RRSPs aren&rsquo;t growing at market rates. Buyers in this stage are identifying symptoms of a problem. They don&rsquo;t know specifically what the problem might be but the symptoms are mentally or physically uncomfortable enough such that it compels them to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; just what is happening.</p><h3> Consideration</h3><p> <br/> In the consideration phase, the buyer is taking the inputs (i.e. the symptoms) and attempting to identify the problem. In the example above, you might go to a doctor or perhaps read some information online (or offline) and come to the conclusion that your child has the stomach flu. Your client with poor RRSP performance, could take a look at their RRSP portfolio, and identify the fact that one of the funds they&rsquo;ve invested in is performing poorly and negating the gains of the other investments. A buyer will not move onto the next stage until they&rsquo;ve gathered enough information and identified the specific problem.</p><h3> Decision</h3><p> <br/> As you might guess, the decision stage is the point at which a buyer gathers information to make a decision to select the best possible strategy or solution to their problem. Basically, they&rsquo;re comparing different solutions. Having identified that your child has stomach flu, you&rsquo;re next likely behaviour would be to try to find solutions that help relieve the symptoms of the virus (or, if you haven&rsquo;t seen a doctor yet, going to see a doctor could also be an option). The most likely scenario with your client would, for example, involve selling that fund and either re-investing their savings it into an existing fund or perhaps investing the savings into a brand new fund or perhaps GIC. Buyers in this stage are collecting alternatives and options that they can choose from to solve their problem and will move onto the final stage which involves the purchase decision.</p><p> A good understanding of your buyer&rsquo;s journey can help you adapt to the changing buyer and help increase the trust you have with clients. Increasing the trust you have with clients creates leads, opportunities and incremental revenue.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 18:55:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 18:55:47.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ap6O6Ta.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-is-the-new-buyer-journey-why-advisors-should-care/\", \"post_id\": \"6273\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 18:55:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 18:55:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-is-the-new-buyer-journey-why-advisors-should-care\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6272\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2877\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442849914809-0df6c377974f-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"323\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443020400,"author_id":30,"chart_url":""}

Inclusive leaders need to be mindful of their audiences when presenting information&mdash;whether at conferences, trade shows, or meetings.</p><h3> Failure to fully understand who your audience is will reflect poorly on yourself and the organization you&rsquo;re representing.</h3><p> <br/> We all suffer from unconscious bias&mdash;but we can uncover our own blind spots by making sure that we&rsquo;re getting input from those who reflect the background and views of the audiences we&rsquo;re attempting to reach.</p><p> <strong>  A recent situation faced by Apple and Adobe illustrates this. </strong> According to Emily Peck&rsquo;s article &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apple-turns-worlds-oldest-catcall-into-product-demo_55f08dd1e4b093be51bd4ae2?utm_hp_ref=business&amp;ir=Business&amp;section=business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apple Turns World's Oldest Catcall Into Product Demo  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; Apple and Adobe teamed up to show how a new, larger iPad makes it easier to edit photos using Adobe Photoshop. The subject of the demo was a woman. &ldquo;In demonstrating Adobe's new Photoshop app for the tablet, designer Eric Snowden imported a photo of a gorgeous woman with a fairly neutral look and proceeded to edit her frown upside down,&rdquo; writes Peck.</p><p> While this doesn&rsquo;t seem overtly offensive, women who saw the demonstration live, as well as women who have heard about the demo since, found it to be a little unnerving. <strong>  Peck argues that this demo plays into the age-old catcall that men use toward women, urging and harassing them to smile when passing them on the street. </strong></p><p> Chances are, Apple and Adobe didn&rsquo;t intend to offend women when they were deciding how to share the benefits of using a larger iPad when editing photos. However, if they had been a bit more attuned to their audience, they might have recognized the slippery slope they were about to slip on. Recent media stories have been focusing on how some women are rebelling against being told to smile in the media (think  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/serena-williams-flawless-response-to-being-asked-why-shes-not-smiling_55f1ec36e4b03784e27897b3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Serena Williams  </a> </u> ), <strong>  and there also seems to be a strong call to stop publishing photos of overly Photoshopped women. </strong></p><p> Given these two pieces of information, it probably would have been in Apple&rsquo;s and Adobe&rsquo;s best interests to have picked a different subject for their demonstration. In fact, it might have best to not even use an actual person.</p><p> Presentation mishaps such as this, however unintended, reflect poorly on the company being represented. It suggests that they may be an organization that&rsquo;s insensitive and may reflect the organization&rsquo;s own lack of diversity. <strong>  Such may be the case with Apple. &ldquo;Overall the company is 70 percent male. Only 20 percent of the tech roles at Apple are held by women,&rdquo; reports Peck. </strong></p><p> This illustrates well the risk that organizations face when their internal audience is not diverse and does not adequately reflect, and mirror, the external audiences they seek to serve. Perhaps, if Apple or Adobe had more women in their workforce this issue might have come to light long before the live presentation ever took place.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t run the risk of offending your audience. </strong> Do your research, scan the room, and make sure you fully understand the views, beliefs and opinions of those who are listening to your message.

{"original_id":2804,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Strengthen Your Brand's Social Voice","link":"how-to-strengthen-your-brands-social-voice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Your brand&rsquo;s social voice should be as strong as the social content it posts.</p><p> What do Mariah Carey, Whitney Huston, Christina Aguilera, Aretha Franklin, and Beyonce Knowles have in common? They all have hit records written by prolific songwriters. Their strong voices along with great written content induced record-breaking singles. Naturally, the messages conveyed in these songs were enhanced by the strength of their voice.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s how to strengthen your brand&rsquo;s social voice: </strong></p><h3> Humanize Your Voice</h3><p> <br/> Establishing clear and concise communications should be a major focal point for brands. Some brands avoid using language similar to what consumers use on social channels. They prefer using formal language to ensure all social communication is clear and not misconstrued.</p><p> Perhaps they fear communicating in this manner will diminish their brand. But will it diminish their brand or make it more &ldquo;human?&rdquo;</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the dilemma: Should a brand communicate efficiently or effectively?</p><p> Since successful brands don&rsquo;t communicate for communications sake, they do it to increase awareness, conversions, or to retain customers. To meet business objectives, I would suggest establishing a brand voice that communicateseffectively. Although efficiency is beneficial, efficacy must be a priority to elevate consumer engagement.</p><p> Essentially, I categorize efficient communication as something derived from a non-human source, such as generic updates and automated responses. When consumers think of being social, they think of engaging with another person. A human being with feelings, emotions and opinions. They will avoid non-human communication at all costs.</p><p> Bottomline: Efficient communication is not automated communication!</p><p> Domino&rsquo;s experienced a backlash when consumers accused the pizza chain of automating social engagements. When a user complimented Domino&rsquo;s Pizza on the brand&rsquo;s Facebook page, a bot mistakenly replied with a message designed to field complaints.</p><br /><p> Domino&rsquo;s claims it was a human error, but I&rsquo;ll let you be the judge. Does it matter if this message was sent from a bot or human? Nope. This generic response conveys how they automate their communication: whether it&rsquo;s a human or not.</p><p> Most brands have previously conceptualized their brand voice for traditional communications such as advertising, public relations, and other marketing efforts.</p><p> Social media, however, is a different ball game.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a medium where bilateral communication is prevalent and outright expected.</p><p> Communicating via Social Media is like screaming at the Grand Canyon. Your brand&rsquo;s voice will echo.</p><p> Unfortunately, many brands view their social media communications as an extension of its traditional communications. They&rsquo;ll simply repost information displayed on its website, brochures or television commercials.</p><p> Sale! Sale! Sale! Buy my new book! Limited time offer! Get it while it lasts!</p><p> At first glance, communicating in this matter seems efficient but it&rsquo;s certainly not <strong>  effective </strong> &mdash;especially on social media.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;</p><h3> Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is</h3><p> <br/> Strengthening your brand&rsquo;s social voice starts with allocating the necessary resources to properly engage with consumers. Businesses often throw interns, junior associates, or anyone who claims they understand social media into social engagements.</p><p> This is counter intuitive.</p><p> Naturally, social communication provides the most engagement and biggest &ldquo;echo&rdquo;.</p><p> As a result, businesses should put more resources into the social channel, not the television channel.</p><p> Social Media Is To A Brand&rsquo;s Voice As Oxygen Is To Fire</p><p> Communicating via social media is simply not enough. Responding to the &ldquo;echos&rdquo; makes your communications effective.</p><p> The best way to do this is by establishing a business structure that supports the ability to actively listen and engage with consumers.</p><p> Is it teaching your sales reps social selling? No. <br/> Is it assigning an intern to manage your social communications? No.</p><p> <strong>  Is it establishing a structure to develop content AND engage with consumers via social media? Darn right it is! </strong></p><h3> Be Present</h3><p> <br/> With all the content available for consumption, it&rsquo;s difficult to keep a brand top of mind. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s difficult to rise above the noise and grab your consumer&rsquo;s attention. To stay relevant, I see brands cranking out new content as often as possible.</p><p> This actually reminds me of juggling.</p><p> When you see someone juggle, you&rsquo;ll notice them preventing the ball from staying at the bottom too long.</p><p> If so, it everything literally falls apart.</p><p>  </p><br /><p> This action is similar to  <u>  content production </u> . Brands try to keep a stream of content at the top of consumer&rsquo;s minds.</p><p> Unfortunately, they sometimes prioritize content creation over content engagement.</p><p> To strengthen your brand&rsquo;s social voice, don&rsquo;t fall victim to this habit. Understand that the value of engagement is just as valuable (or more valuable) as the content itself.</p><p> Having a strong brand voice is dependent on the structure and resources the business has established.</p><p> I suggest establishing a centralized structure when building a response team. It should be the responsibility of one group to monitor closely and respond to consumers as you release content.</p><p> If multiple people on your team manage the social communications, the tone of your company&rsquo;s posts may differ depending on who publishes what content. This group should agree on how to post to ensure your brand has a consistent  <u>  tone of voice </u> .</p><h3> Have A Voice And Be Heard</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s right. Have a voice. Be heard.</p><p> Contribute to the conversations taking place in your consumer&rsquo;s social world. Social engagement shapes conversations ranging from politics and celebrity to business and brand loyalty.</p><p> Without establishing a brand voice, you&rsquo;ll end up waiting to jump into a conversation in like a kid eagerly awaiting to jump-rope.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve established a brand voice, jumping in becomes easy.</p><p> Developing a strong brand voice means preparing to jump into conversations that are revenant to consumers that lead to  <u>  fostering stronger relationships </u> .</p><p> Steer clear of questionable conversations as the end result may not be what you expect. It&rsquo;s important to understand where the conversation may lead.</p><p> Treat your conversation as you would when on your first date: avoid topics regarding politics or religion.</p><p> Ultimately, don&rsquo;t let your social governance hinder your engagements. It shouldn&rsquo;t prevent you from being an interesting brand.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Social media, however, is a different ball game.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a medium where bilateral communication is prevalent and outright expected.</p><p> Communicating via Social Media is like screaming at the Grand Canyon. Your brand&rsquo;s voice will echo</p><p> Unfortunately, many brands view their social media communications as an extension of its traditional communications. They&rsquo;ll simply repost information displayed on its website, brochures or television commercials.</p><p> Once you have established your brand&rsquo;s tone of voice, now you can strengthen it. I suggest by developing a social communications playbook so all responsible parties are on the same page. If you ensure that everyone is in agreement about your brand&rsquo;s voice, it will help alleviate questions or concerns about social conversations and how your company should respond.</p><p> As you strive for communication consistency, you&rsquo;ll likely realize your brand&rsquo;s social voice will not fit all scenarios that may arise.</p><p> Remember, it&rsquo;s important to &ldquo;stick to the script&rdquo;. Follow your brand&rsquo;s playbook to ensure consistency but maintain a certain level of spontaneity to keep your audience coming back for more.</p><p> That&rsquo;s how you strengthen your brand&rsquo;s social voice.</p><p>  </p><p> Sources:</p>http://www.hollyfame.com/top-10-female-singers-powerful-voices/<br/>http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/35506.asp<br/>Image credits: Shutterstock","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-22 19:46:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-22 19:46:18.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_jHk42wq.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-strengthen-your-brands-social-voice/\", \"post_id\": \"6277\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-22 19:46:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-22 19:46:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-strengthen-your-brands-social-voice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6276\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2879\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-22-at-1.23.36-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"435\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443024000,"author_id":258,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2807,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Impact of Robo-Advice Will Be Widespread – Here's What You Need to Do","link":"the-impact-of-robo-advice-will-be-widespread-heres-what-you-need-to-do","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulresnik\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Paul Resnik  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.riskprofiling.com/Home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   FinaMetrica  </u> </a> A growing number of businesses are starting to focus on robo-advisers, who provide a simple process to typically match personal goals to a low cost portfolio. Whether you think they are good or bad, there&rsquo;s probably little protection from their impact. In fact, wherever you sit in the financial service supply chain, a robo will probably be &ldquo;visiting&rdquo; you, your clients and prospects soon. <strong>  In this article we will be exploring the impact of robos on the advice industry. </strong> While there are a number of advisory firms and advisers who feel confident that their clients, centres of referral and other networks will hold firm against the impending, well-funded marketing of robos, <strong>  others are building their defences. </strong> Many advisory businesses understand that they must move their client engagement to higher levels of discovery and personalisation than that of robos. Traditional businesses realise they need to add other services that clients value, for which they will be prepared to pay. They also appreciate that their investment services must become visibly more personalised to take into account their clients&rsquo; individual needs and circumstances.Some advisers have reacted by adding their own low-cost robo service options. These investment adjuncts to their main offerings are targeted at smaller clients who have less demanding investment needs. Of course some argue that this is akin to inviting the &ldquo;fox into the hen house&rdquo;.Yet other advisers see robos as doing nothing more than providing low-cost mid-quality investment solutions that meet clients&rsquo; simpler investment needs. They have no intention of providing a similar service.</p><h3> The options for advisers</h3>So what are the best options for advisory businesses, taking into account robo competition?Personal advice is founded on building rapport with clients by understanding them, exploring their individual circumstances and recommending investments, and other services, that suit their needs. There are any number of client propositions that a firm might adopt. Five service offerings are illustrated in the graphic below (click to enlarge).<a href=\"https://2fglh1u4p8-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Service-propositions-and-value.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Service propositions and value\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://2fglh1u4p8-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Service-propositions-and-value.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/></a>From left to right:<strong> Box 1 &ndash; Commodity impersonal advice and complex portfolios: </strong>Represents &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; investment advising with an emphasis on &lsquo;finding&rsquo; investment performance, often provided with little proven portfolio competencies and usually with limited, unstructured and often idiosyncratic client discovery processes.<strong> Box 2 &ndash; Need/capacity v ATRisk and model portfolios: </strong>Represents planning businesses giving advice utilising simple investor risk profiling. Advisers often use tests with less than 10 questions and then link scores to model portfolios. This service can be carried out by a robo who can do it quickly, and reasonably accurately, at lower investment cost for single goals.<strong> Box 3 &ndash; Life planning and model portfolios: </strong>The advisory practice typically uses goals-based planning supplemented with cash flow and sometimes Monte Carlo testing.<strong> Box 4 &ndash; Life planning and personal portfolios: </strong>Represents advisory practices which provide goals-based planning, usually supplemented with cash flow and Monte Carlo testing. They build personalised portfolios for clients using proven methodologies aiming to outperform simple model portfolios usually after analysis of tax, inheritance and control issues.<strong> Box 5- Life planning and highly personlised portfolios:</strong> Represents multi-generational family offices offering highly personalised investment solutions taking into account the individual needs of members usually after detailed analysis of tax, inheritance and control issues.<h3> Positioning and client understanding</h3>Wherever your business is currently positioned, you are likely to face competition from others in your space, from businesses in other segments moving into your space and new players who see the opportunity in investment advice.<strong> For example, businesses in Box 1 are the most vulnerable to robo competition.</strong> They tend to have lower levels of understanding of clients&rsquo; longer-term needs, less suitable advice and indefensible positioning against competitors offering more personal services. Advisers in this segment will likely tend to be price takers, if not historically, then in the future. They are the businesses most vulnerable to competition from robos, and the ones who will most likely benefit longer term from bringing robos into their business.On the one hand, they need to improve their portfolio offerings and on the other, <strong> such businesses need to have greater client engagement and suitability processes than the simple three to 10-question investor profilers that most robos offer.</strong><strong> A typical robo makes a portfolio recommendation based on a scored algorithm built on as little as three necessarily simple characteristics.</strong> What&rsquo;s your risk tolerance? What&rsquo;s your capacity for loss? What&rsquo;s your time horizon?Such a profiler takes no account of existing assets, tax position and the consequences of financial changes, estate planning or social security impacts, differences in individuals&rsquo; risk tolerance or differences in couples&rsquo; risk tolerances if the monies are held jointly.Nor do robos necessarily take into account investor anxieties when markets run or crash other than warning the adviser to increase the regularity and personalisation of communication. <strong> Robos aren&rsquo;t very likely to hold clients&rsquo; hands in times of stress.</strong> Because they don&rsquo;t have a detailed understanding of the investors&rsquo; goals, and have great difficulty framing investment experiences against investors&rsquo; goals, robos have been described as &ldquo;fairweather advisers&rdquo;.Businesses that that have already developed a simple process to discover financial needs and match those to portfolios, as in Box 2, are in direct competition with robos. They need to move to Box 3, which in turn increases competition to the incumbents.<h3> Build closer relationships</h3>Planning businesses have to understand their positioning and pricing in comparison to others and how they can improve their situation. The aim in moving from the bottom left red to the top right green box is for advisers to build closer relationships with their clients through superior personal service, more personalised portfolios and to differentiate what they do from robos.At each level there is a greater likelihood of attracting and retaining wealthier clients with more complex needs and generating higher fees.<strong> Robos aren&rsquo;t going to go away.</strong>The technology constraints that limited their development are largely gone. The regulatory restrictions that limited their application are under review. Every business in the service supply chain needs to have a researched, costed position on their impact.With this understanding FinaMetrica is finalising its Investor Profiler suitability &lsquo;plug-in&rsquo; for existing and aspiring robos. We expect a growing demand for quality suitability processes from automated advisers.<strong> No robo can afford the loss of confidence that accompanies legal claims from dissatisfied clients.</strong><strong> Each plug-in is built on a:</strong><li> Market proven 12- or 25-question psychometric risk tolerance test. We&rsquo;ve been delivering these tests to the market since 1998 and have more than 850,000 on file.</li><li> Market proven investor profiling methodology, which brings together risk tolerance with analysing clients&rsquo; capacity for loss and time horizon issues. One of our profilers has been successfully in use with a Swiss bank for over seven years. A typical client has a $5 million pot and our tool is helping to manage this pot.</li><li> Market proven ability to frame investment expectations through our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.riskprofiling.com/resources/rp_resources#4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Risk and Return Guide  </a> </u> . We are not aware of any successful legal claim against a FinaMetrica subscriber. Our licensees report that during 2007-09 their clients stayed the course because the risks they were taking were consistent with their risk tolerance and they understood those risks. Our licensees acknowledge our risk profiling system&rsquo;s central role in this success.</li>As part of this, FinaMetrica is working collaboratively on white papers covering the regulation of robo advice, a consistent risk language to be used by the financial services supply and distribution chain, suggestions for a robust due diligence process for assessing the risk tolerance component of an investor profiler and an analysis of the several different robo models around the world.

Today, women probably spend four times as much as men on their appearance, maybe more. The amount of money spent on clothing and accessories can do damage to one&rsquo;s budget. Happily, it's possible to start spending more prudently.</p><p> The first step is to set up a budget. Determine how much of your disposable income you can afford to spend on your appearance each month. Then, try as hard as you can to stick to that amount. If you slip up one month, just try harder the next month. <strong>  These tips may help: </strong></p><h3> Figure out your Style</h3><p> <br/> Many women buy clothing that they seldom wear. It&rsquo;s usually because the article of clothing did not suit them or fit their style. Maybe a well-meaning friend or salesperson insisted &ldquo;it looks fabulous on you!&rdquo; &ndash; and you realize later it most decidedly does not.  It&rsquo;s easy for a wardrobe to mushroom with such ill-advised purchases but still feel like you have nothing to wear. Figuring out your style is the answer.</p><p> <strong>  Here are some ideas to help figure out your style </strong></p><p> 1. Go through your closet and pull out the pieces that you wear over and over again. These will offer strong clues about how you like to look.  As you are pulling out the items that you love, set aside anything you haven&rsquo;t worn in a year.  </p><p> 2.  Browse magazines and tear out pictures of outfits that appeal to you.</p><p> Or, pin photos on a Pinterest Board.</p><p> 3.  Analyze your weekly or monthly routines and activities. If you&rsquo;re not going to many cocktail parties and own ten cocktail dresses, this may provide a clue about what to stop buying!</p><p> Once you get a better handle on your personal style, you will be more selective about what you buy.</p><h3> Get Help From a Professional Stylist</h3><p> <br/> If you find it impossible to do the closet audit yourself, hire an expert to help you.</p><p> An experienced stylist or organizer will take the emotion out of the equation and squelch your attempts to hold onto clothing that doesn&rsquo;t work for you or your lifestyle. Even though hiring help will cost you money, it will be well worth it in the end when you have a new well-edited wardrobe. On future shopping trips, you are less likely to make mistakes. </p><p> You can also employ a stylist to help you shop. A good stylist will help you fine-tune your personal style, go shopping with you seasonally and even find great items on sale for you. Again, this will cost you a fee, but save you time and money in the long run. </p><p> Besides the cost savings, understanding your personal style can have psychological and emotional benefits, as your appearance will better reflect who you are. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 15:29:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 15:29:48.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_pFJNOm8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/finding-your-style-can-save-you-money/\", \"post_id\": \"6285\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 15:29:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 15:29:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"finding-your-style-can-save-you-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6284\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2883\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-08-19-at-7.38.53-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"368\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443121200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2809,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Capturing Generational Legacy","link":"capturing-generational-legacy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Writte by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KirbyRosplock\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dr. Kirby Rosplock  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.rosplock.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Art &amp; Science of the Family Office  </u> </a></p><h3> Generational Legacy</h3><p> <br/> When you ask individuals how they define legacy, the answers vary greatly. For some, legacy means their ethical will that conveys important personal stories, values, principles and beliefs. For others, legacy means financial-leaving valuables, keepsakes or wealth. And for others, legacy means a philanthropic footprint that influences, impacts and endows causes, making the world a better place. How does one bring into focus what is important for others to know, remember, honor or appreciate about one&rsquo;s life? <strong>  The family office can help facilitate an enduring legacy of the family and it&rsquo;s individual members. </strong></p><h3> Legacy to the Senior Generation</h3><p> <br/> For members of the senior generation, the process of capturing one&rsquo;s legacy is powerful, and can illuminate the character of an individual and what they have endured in their life. This also provides a window for other family members to experience influential stories that shaped the family dynamics. The senior generation&rsquo;s legacy can be captured in oral, written or film accounts of these stories, experiences and impressions. Iris Wagner (interviewed in an earlier blog post) founder and film creator of Memoirs Productions, has helped many individuals articulate their legacy for sharing with family members of all generations. Iris says that legacy is as much about the process of helping individuals reflect on the events that have given their lives meaning as it is about the end product. &ldquo;Often, stories are revealed that even their children have never heard. Legacy is about linking the past to the present and providing guideposts for future generations,&rdquo; shares Wagner. For families where there is a heritage of capturing legacies of family members over generations, these stories help illuminate values, and build a mantel of moral fibers that can bridge one generation to the next.</p><p> Fredda Herz Brown, PhD and Fran Lotery, PhD, note in their book The Family Wealth Sustainability Toolkit that, &ldquo;A legacy is at once timeless and time bound. By the time a family business has been shaped into a family enterprise, the group understands that its legacy is something different than what it owns, and a shared vision and values have been adopted. Each generation then has the important responsibility of molding its own vision and values, recommitting to the family legacy, and reshaping it for the future.&rdquo; For Herz Brown and Lotery, legacy is a way to reconnect to the values and heritage of the family, and to help recharge and reinvigorate their shared vision. Both authors agree that legacy is a critical component to the long-term sustainability of a family, not merely an exercise for reflection.</p><p> John A. Warnick is founder of the Purposeful Planning Institute, a professional organization whose members assist clients in creating legacy. Warnick suggests the purpose and meaning of a family&rsquo;s wealth is too often buried beneath complicated legal and estate documents. &ldquo;Lost in the sterility of the typical legalese of wills and trusts is the love parents and grandparents feel for their children and grandchildren- the faith they have in their descendants&rsquo; potential to grow and develop, and the hope they hold for the future.&rdquo; He trains advisors to use visioning exercises and purposeful conversations to harness a client&rsquo;s positive emotional energy and skillfully weave those expressions of love, meaning, values and wisdom into the financial and estate planning structure. </p><p> Many children and grandchildren of those who have created such a legacy report experiencing &ldquo;tears of joy&rdquo; when hearing or reading their parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; vision and purpose. Warnick finds it sparks a much stronger appreciation for the meaning of the wealth, and is a powerful antidote against entitlement. Warnick also stresses the importance of family meetings, storytelling and meaningful conversations as additional ingredients in the purposeful transitioning of all dimensions of a family&rsquo;s wealth.</p><p> Rick Harig, principal of Legacy Resources, has also made his life&rsquo;s work about helping affluent individuals discover the meaning and purpose of their wealth. In one client experience, Harig shared a story of a couple who had substantial wealth and had worked strategically to plan and organize it efficiently, yet they did not find meaning in what they had amassed or the impact their wealth could have. As a legacy strategist, Harig helped them go beyond transactional planning to transformational planning so that their wealth would have deeper meaning.</p><p> Not all members of the senior generation are comfortable tackling the legacy question on their own, and as a result, there is a growing movement in the wealth management and family office industries to help individuals design legacy conversations.</p><h3> Legacy to the Next Generation</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Capturing legacy can be difficult. </strong> It requires individuals to take a journey through different parts of life, experiences, places and influential people who have been impactful. There are helpful tools and exercises available, such as the Legacy Conversation developed by Dr. Carolyn Friend and Dr. James Weiner. In an interview with Friend and Weiner, Friend shared her personal experience as a beneficiary of wealth left by her parents. Yet, the valuables left behind were merely objects, and what Friend longed for was a deeper connection to her deceased parents. Today, Dr. Friend and Dr. Weiner have made their mission about engaging the senior generation with their children in a broader legacy conversation to inspire their future together. &ldquo;Family dynamics in affluent families can be transformed through the process of engaging a family in a legacy dialogue that reaches across generations. The power of the conversation is not only on the senior generation, but the meaning it can bestow on the future members of the family,&rdquo; shares Friend and Weiner. The team has built an advisory practice to aid affluent families in intergenerational dialogue around legacy issues.</p><p> The legacy conversation in a family does not have to be an isolated event or exercise. Rather, the seeds of legacy can be sewn over time and captured and memorialized in a number of different ways. In my family, my grandfather captured lessons and inspiring or humorous quotes from each of his milestone birthdays. His memoir was self-published and shared with our family and friends as a keepsake and a powerful glimpse into the life he lived and obstacles he overcame form decade to decade. His memoir will be passed down from generation to generation in my family.</p><p> Many families also make it a part of their educational process to engage future generations in interviewing their elders. These informal discussions are sometimes recorded or transcribed. The next generation may present what they&rsquo;ve learned from their great aunt of grandfather at a family retreat or meeting. This can be a powerful and enlightening exercise that can inspire and motivate each generation of the family.  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 15:50:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 15:50:53.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_6euAhoa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/capturing-generational-legacy/\", \"post_id\": \"6287\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 15:50:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 15:50:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"capturing-generational-legacy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6286\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2884\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-23-at-8.56.46-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"356\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443096000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

That was then. Back before we all discovered that they&rsquo;ve been rigging their emissions tests and lying to pretty much, well, everyone on the planet. Before VW stock crashed after plummeting 20% or more.</p><p> As the  <u>  biggest auto-maker in the world </u> , employing more than three-quarters of a million people, the fallout could be catastrophic.</p><h3> What does this mean in everyday terms?</h3><p> <br/> That VW programmed some engines to turn on emissions control only during tests. The rest of the time, you know, out on the road where it really matters&hellip; those same cars would run emissions 40x higher.</p><p> Michael Horn, president of VW America has admitted they violated the company&rsquo;s mission &ldquo;by manipulating software to make its diesel cars appear cleaner than they are,&rdquo; and that VW has &ldquo;totally screwed up&rdquo;. ( <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/21/investing/vw-emissions-cheating-shares/\" target=\"_blank\">   CNN  </a> </u> ) To the tune of about 11,000,000 vehicles around the world. CNN also reports that VW has allocated $7.3 BILLION dollars to handle the costs of recalls in an &ldquo;effort to win back the trust&rdquo; of people who thought they were doing the planet a favor by buying \"sustainable\" VW cars. That doesn&rsquo;t even begin to count the $18 BILLION in possible fines from the USA alone.</p><h3> Really Mr. Horn? That&rsquo;s the best you can manage?</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Oopsies. Our bad. We screwed up. We&rsquo;ll drop a few billion bucks on positive propaganda until the world forgets this happened&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> VW is facing the very real possibility that no one will ever trust their marketing again &mdash; because, once you&rsquo;ve lied about something this big, what else are you lying about too? But this colossal scandal isn&rsquo;t just about them. It has the potential to cast suspicion on not only every other sustainable auto company (Mercedes and BMW stock both lost points since the scandal broke), but also on companies stating a mission of sustainability across other industries.</p><p> <strong>  Which leads both consumers and corporations the world over to ask piercing and pointed questions such as: </strong></p><p> - When can you EVER know for sure that a company&rsquo;s mission isn&rsquo;t just words on paper? <br/> - How do you measure transparency from your favorite brands? <br/> - Even more challenging, how do you offer transparency in ways that are undeniably believable by your consumers?</p><br /><p> So, dear VW, here are three things you could have done at pretty much any point along the way, to avoid flaming out while the world looks on:</p><h3> 1. Design better.</h3><p> At some point, someone discovered the emissions issue, and someone decided that the simplest way to fix it would be to write software code to rig the engines during tests. Instead, VW should have gone to the root of the problem and designed a lower emissions engine. Fix the cause, rather than patching the symptom.</p><h3> 2. Be honest.</h3><p> Own your problem to your buyers. In case that feels like rocket science, this is what honesty looks like: &ldquo;Good morning, VW world. We&rsquo;ve discovered that Jettas, Beetles, and Golfs could be improved in their emissions efficiency, and we want you to know that we&rsquo;re working on it. We&rsquo;ll keep you posted as soon as we have a solution that is true to our brand and makes you still proud to buy from us!&rdquo; That should have happened, oh&hellip; about 11 million cars ago. Like, about five minutes after first realizing there was an emissions problem.</p><h3> 3. Blow the whistle on yourself.</h3><p> Maybe the problem got away from you? <br/> Maybe it was covered up by middle management? <br/> Maybe you discovered it way, way too late and the short-term fix seemed like a smart idea when you were suffocating under the crushing reality of your mistake? Totally understandable. But waiting until a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theicct.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   third party  </a> </u>  outs your dishonesty to the world? Rookie mistake, especially for the American market. American culture may extend near-unlimited grace to those who out themselves and show intention to change, but we can hold a near-permanent boycott grudge against those caught cheating. Blame it on the old Wild West.</p><p> In essence, the lesson for every business owner in the world right now is this:short-term thinking can destroy your brand, possibly permanently. If self-destruction is your endgame, go right ahead and operate on a mindset of short-term profit. If you prefer survival, you gotta live with one face, operate on one set of values, and embrace one single identity that drives everything you do.</p><p> <strong>  Without that, sooner or later you&rsquo;re going to end up just like Volkswagen. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 17:03:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 17:03:22.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_zOCX47m.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-leadership-tips-to-make-sure-you-never-end-up-like-volkswagen/\", \"post_id\": \"6289\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 17:03:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 17:03:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-leadership-tips-to-make-sure-you-never-end-up-like-volkswagen\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6288\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2885\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-23-at-10.14.19-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"750\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443092400,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2811,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Getting Millennials to Consider Life Insurance","link":"getting-millennials-to-consider-life-insurance","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Young adults are increasingly putting off making big financial commitments or investments &ndash; such as getting married and buying a house or purchasing life insurance. Too many young professionals simply don&rsquo;t realize that it is almost always better to buy life insurance sooner rather than later, and it&rsquo;s up to agents to inform them of this.</p><p> As life insurance agents, it&rsquo;s important to recognize both how to address the hesitations of millennials, as well as how to approach the subject with them. Personal finance columnist Gary Parsons writes that many millennials believe purchasing life insurance <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/money/2014/09/21/millennials-remain-unconvinced-of-their-need-for-life-insurance/15918335/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   is a complicated process  </a> </u> involving lots of paperwork. &ldquo;Insurance companies and financial advisors alike will need to tailor their approach to attract the younger generation,&rdquo; said Parsons. <strong>  &ldquo;Simpler products delivered on their terms, i.e., online, may be the best way to reach them.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Delivering products online will help agents better serve millennials, but they must first get them interested in the products. Creating an online presence is a great starting point, and there are <u>  <a href=\"https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/2015/09/08/get-creative-in-opening-the-life-insurance-conversation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a few things agents can do  </a> </u> to get the ball rolling.</p><li> <strong>  Images: </strong> Creating images or graphics that catch the attention of viewers and engage prospective buyers is important. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to put some quotes and a contact number on a post, or a link to a landing page with a call to action. Use images that people can relate to, such as high-quality images of a young family.</li><li> <strong>  Boost your post: </strong> For Facebook, boosting or sponsoring a post means paying a little bit of money so that your post will be seen by viewers outside of your &ldquo;fans&rdquo; on social media. Doing this here and there helps get your message in front of a larger audience quickly, and it is a cheap option for growing your reach.</li><li> <strong>  Use hashtags: </strong> On Twitter, using hashtags works in a similar way as boosting a post in that it helps reach people outside of your normal &ldquo;followers.&rdquo; Using hashtags relevant to the content you&rsquo;re sharing can help you get noticed by other users searching for similar information. For example, when sharing an article about the importance of life insurance, you can use #lifeinsurance or #protectyourfamily. <br/>  </li><p> Once you&rsquo;ve established yourself online and created interest from potential clients, you&rsquo;ll be able to start reaching out. As an agent you already have a few go-to ways of starting conversations with clients that you can use. With younger clients you can also start the conversation online, however it&rsquo;s important to take it to email or the phone after the introductory exchange. A couple of points that agents should focus on when reaching out to millennials:</p><li> <strong>  Cash value: </strong>  Many people mistakenly think of life insurance as something that won&rsquo;t benefit them until after they are gone, however, many permanent life insurance policies build cash value over time. That means in addition to increasing the value of an overall estate, coverage also increases financial resources and stability while you are still alive.   </li><li> <strong>  Insurability: </strong>  When it comes to life coverage, you will likely never be more &ldquo;insurable&rdquo; than you are right now. It&rsquo;s much better to lock in rates while you are young and healthy, rather than waiting until you are middle-aged with one or two new health problems. Ultimately, you could end up saving yourself thousands of dollars.</li><h3> Reaching millennials online, where they&rsquo;re already going for their news and information,</h3><p> <br/> is crucial to starting the conversation about life insurance with them. Through education and the right <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/life-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   life insurance learning tools  </a> </u> , agents can reach out to millennials, help them examine the many benefits life insurance can offer and ultimately increase their business as well.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 17:09:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 17:09:27.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Buxz2Nd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/getting-millennials-to-consider-life-insurance/\", \"post_id\": \"6291\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 17:09:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 17:09:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"getting-millennials-to-consider-life-insurance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6290\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2886\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442810480970-6d3fc310e3eb-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"401\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443103200,"author_id":71,"chart_url":""}

It's like someone noticing you&rsquo;re way too loud; plain for them to hear, but not obvious to you, unless you ask, and/or they tell you. </p><p> That's why there&rsquo;s no better way to learn of your strengths-become-weaknesses than to ask for a bit of feedback from people around you, like colleagues, clients, or family. You can ask:</p><p> &ldquo;Which of my strengths become a (problem / issue / weakness) at times?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you notice a pattern to when or how that happens?&rdquo;</p><p> Be prepared , though, because you may take a hit to the ego as I suggested above.</p><p> Often leaders say to me &ldquo;Yah, but this is how I got to where I am today.&rdquo; I respond that they got there becauseof that great core strength, and  <strong>  despite </strong>  the times when they misuse or overuse it.

{"original_id":2813,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When and When Not to Work with an RIA Compliance Consultant","link":"when-and-when-not-to-work-with-an-ria-compliance-consultant","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a></p><p> As registered investment adviser (RIA) compliance consultants, two common questions we hear from principals of advisory firms are: 1) why should I work with a compliance consultant? and 2) how does your firm's service compare to that of a law firm? These are great questions and we wanted to use this post as an opportunity to discuss the different scenarios in which it does and does not make sense for an RIA firm to work with a compliance consultant.</p><h3> The Advantages of Preventative Care Compared to Emergency Room Care</h3><p> <br/> Think about a compliance consultant much like one thinks about utilizing preventative care rather than always heading to the emergency room (ER) for healthcare needs. ER care is expensive and ideally not utilized unless absolutely necessary. <strong>   The right RIA compliance consultant should help keep an investment advisory firm out of trouble </strong>  by keeping the firm aware of the relevant rules and providing the human expertise and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/myriacompliance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   technology platform  </a> </u>  to help the firm meet its ongoing regulatory requirements.</p><p> On the other hand, the closest equivalent to ER care in the RIA world is the use of securities lawyers. To be clear, when an issue arises, paying top dollar for a competent securities lawyer is the right path to take. However, utilizing expensive legal support billing by the hour to help with daily compliance management and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/what-could-cause-your-ria-firm-to-undergo-an-audit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   audit preparation  </a> </u>  can be quite costly. The cost structure of many law firms prevents them from being able to provide cost efficient investment adviser regulatory support.</p><p> Often, we receive inquires from advisory firms that have just received notice that the firm has a regulatory issue that is being referred to a state or federal level enforcement division for potential legal action. Unfortunately, by that point, the RIA firm is in much more need of a securities lawyer rather than a compliance consultant.  <strong>  When a firm already has a serious issue with a regulator, more affordable preventative regulatory care is no longer a option. </strong> Our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/on-going-compliance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   compliance consulting service  </a> </u>  does not provide any form of legal support and we are always very upfront about that with our clients.</p><h3> Our Core Beliefs as Investment Adviser Compliance Consultants <br/>  </h3><li> As RIA compliance consultants,  <strong>  we strongly believe in the value of \"compliance best practices\" as valuable tools to help a firm establish the proper \"culture of compliance\" </strong>  that regulators want to and expect to see. We also steadfastly believe that it is very rarely in a firm's best interest to take an adversarial approach with a regulator. Generally, such an approach only leads to a stack of legal bills that could have been avoided.</li><li> <strong>  We also recognize that the vast majority of RIA firms have a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) that is a bit overwhelmed as he or she is more commonly than not wearing multiple hats at the firm. </strong> In such cases, the ability for the CCO to have an experienced former regulator or compliance expert on call to help them navigate the relevant regulations can be quite valuable and cost efficient. We are the first to acknowledge that RIA compliance is not rocket science, but it does require a significant time investment to get up to and stay up to speed on the latest requirements. Unfortunately, most RIA firm principals are not only wearing the CCO hat, but also being tasked with managing the firm, making investment decisions, and meeting new prospects. As such, the return on investment (ROI) in being able to call an expert and immediately receive the right answer or being able to access a library of compliance document templates can be compelling.</li><li> <strong>  We also believe that the   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-sec-is-reviewing-the-outsourced-ria-chief-compliance-officer-model\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    CCO role should never be \"outsourced\" to a third party   </a>  </u>   or person who is not a principal of the RIA firm. </strong> Firms like ours can assist a CCO wearing multiple hats with proper training and guidance, but it's still essential that the firm's CCO be someone at the firm that is empowered with full responsibility and authority to develop and enforce the appropriate policies and procedures for an advisory firm. </li><li> Furthermore, our investment adviser compliance consulting service does not charge for services by the hour.  <strong>  We do not want to discourage a client from reaching out to us to discuss a concern because of the fear that the \"hourly billing clock\" will be running. </strong> We offer unlimited phone and email support because quite frankly it is a far superb client experience and also alleviates the administrative burden on both parties to track and verify an hourly invoice. By charging a flat monthly fee, we also allow an RIA firm to be able to more confidently budget future compliance expenses.</li><li> Lastly,  <strong>  we fully recognize the value that technology </strong>  can bring to help advisory firms better and more efficiently manage their regulatory requirements. For example, our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/myriacompliance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MyRIACompliance investment adviser compliance software  </a> </u>  solution provides each of our clients with a robust online platform to manage of all of their firm's regulatory responsibilities in a more efficient manner. It also provides each firm with a tailored and fully customizable compliance calendar which we believe is critical in helping to establish an organized compliance program regardless of the size or complexity of an advisory firm.</li><h3> Shifting Compliance Needs of Larger RIA Firms</h3><p> <br/> In addition to existing regulatory problems, there are also some common RIA business scenarios in which the \"expertise\" value of a traditional compliance consultant may be diminished. The most common scenario is one in which a large advisory firm has a qualified and experienced Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) on staff along with a strong internal compliance team. In such a case,  <strong>  the advisory firm may be better served working with a compliance consultant less so for regulatory expertise but rather as a more affordable, outsourcing of labor option in which the consultant may assist with regulatory filings and firm and individual investment adviser representative registrations. </strong> Often, significant savings can be achieved by utilizing a third party that specializes in such services. In general, we see this type of relationship as most valuable to firms with one billion or more in assets under management (AUM).</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 18:40:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 18:40:23.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_LNCRmUC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-and-when-not-to-work-with-an-ria-compliance-consultant/\", \"post_id\": \"6295\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 18:40:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 18:40:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-and-when-not-to-work-with-an-ria-compliance-consultant\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6294\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2888\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442906361539-6f7052120e7b.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"658\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443114900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2815,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why the Business Plan is Not Enough!","link":"why-the-business-plan-is-not-enough","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Entrepreneurs may be tempted to start writing the business plan as a first item of business once the technological and competitive basis of the company is determined and provisional patent applications accomplished. The business plan, of course, is the key document needed to open up discussions with potential investors. Its completion would seem to presage the securitization of investment needed to start the business.</p><p> My experience with numerous entrepreneurs, inventors, and innovators is that a keen appreciation of the importance of having the rationale for the sales projections stated in the business plan is often lacking. To be fair, it is hard work to come up with a robust marketing and sales plan that ultimately underlies the value of the business.</p><p> However, the business plan (BP) needs to be supported with defensible projections of revenue, sales, and net profit. Projections of revenue and sales are derived from a detailed analysis of the target markets and the strategies and tactics needed to secure revenue and sales. Net profit is determined from an analysis of all relevant financial factors and reported in the financial plan (FP).</p><h3> The Marketing &amp; Sales Plan.</h3><p> <br/> The assumptions and conclusions reached in the marketing-and-sales plan (MSP) need to be supported with both data and sensible extractions and analysis. The volume of supporting material researched in order to develop the MSP is typically too large to place within a business plan (BP), and its presence within the BP would be distracting; hence, a separate plan for marketing and sales is necessary.</p><p> The MSP represents a continuous thought process, from relevant facts and data (related to markets, products, and competitors) to the identification and selection of appropriate strategies and tactics for the company to deploy. Major conclusions are summarized in several pages using charts and figures in both the MSP and BP. The MSP should be referenced in the BP and provided to investors when needed, and, like the BP, the MSP is considered a confidential document and only provided serious potential investors.</p><p> The effort to develop an appropriate MSP is often underestimated and given inadequate consideration by entrepreneurs. Unless you are an entrepreneur with a marketing and/or sales background, the MSP can be challenging to adequately prepare, but it can be done. But it would be a mistake to start the BP before the MSP is well along. Why? Because it is difficult, if not impossible, to write a fully adequate BP unless the key underpinnings of the MSP exist.</p><p> The MSP is the most important document to start first because of the longer calendar time it takes to conduct research and analysis properly. The sales projections resulting from the MSP support the initial valuation of the business and are carefully reviewed by investors. The critical elements of strategy, tactics, and projections must have been thought out and rationalized in order for any estimate of sales to be sound. Furthermore, critical early-stage revenue rests ultimately on the efficacy of the initial MSP and its execution. Founders also support their own credibility by demonstrating to investors that they understand markets, products, and competition sufficiently to develop sustainable strategies and tactics.</p><h3> The Financial Plan</h3><p>  </p><p> If you are fortunate enough to have a financially minded person on your team, then the hurdle of developing sound financial data will be more easily surmounted. If, like many early entrepreneurial teams, you are missing your future CFO, then you may be faced with developing financial information and projections without that person&rsquo;s expert guidance.</p><p> Details about how to put a financial plan together that is respected by investors is described in Chapter 6 of my book. An excellent method for development of an integrated set of financial statements that enable an entrepreneur to also perform financial modeling is provided by securing my CD from Amazon ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2KPSI2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2KPSI2  </a> </u> ).</p><p> In any event, a sound set of financial statements will serve your business well and make investors much more amenable to making an investment.</p><h3> The Business Plan</h3><p> <br/> The business plan (BP) should be viewed as an investment document that presents an investment opportunity that is supported by sales projections, financial statements, and concise but fully explained reasons as to why the business will be successful and provide a return of capital to the investor. In this context, the BP is typically the document most discussed between investors and entrepreneurs; however, it is merely one of a triad of important documents, as illustrated in the figure used in this posting.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 18:55:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 18:55:47.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_GAathF7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-the-business-plan-is-not-enough/\", \"post_id\": \"6299\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 18:55:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 18:55:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-the-business-plan-is-not-enough\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6298\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2890\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442975631115-c4f7b05b8a2c-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"854\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443122100,"author_id":408,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2816,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Ask/Don't Tell: 7-Steps to Creating Genuine Relationships","link":"dont-ask-dont-tell-7-steps-to-creating-genuine-relationships","source_link":null,"content":"<p> An audience member recently asked Malcolm Gladwell, the prolific author of books as  Blink  and  The Tipping Point , if he had any ideas for a kinder and gentler society. His idea seemed to stun everyone. He proposed a &ldquo;don't ask/don't tell&rdquo; for all. Most will reflexively assume that this applies to asking and telling of one&rsquo;s sexual orientation. But not so quick. Mr. Gladwell was not talking about that at all. Rather, he suggested that one should not ask what college you attended and should not tell what college they attended. Why? He feels that people will choose schools less for prestige and &ldquo;bragging rights&rdquo; and more for the best fit.</p><p> You see, though, Mr. Gladwell may be onto something very big. His &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask/don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; college attendance policy may stop some adults from reminiscing at cocktail parties about their glory days at Yale, but as far as bettering society, I doubt it will have a great effect.</p><p> However, what if we applied a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask/don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; policy to all human interaction? Many times, conversations end up as little boxing matches&mdash;trying to win tiny victories, interacting for the sole purpose of gathering information to know exactly where we stand. And then using that information to know whether we are inferior or superior to our &ldquo;opponent&rdquo;.  In fact, rarely people listen because they genuinely care, but rather do so, while waiting for an opportunity to chime in about themselves.</p><p> Here is the point: I am calling for us to connect with one another in the spirit of compassion and collaboration rather than competition. It is our base instinct to compete&mdash;to assess who is above us and who is inferior to us. But that instinct is a primitive one. In order to allow our divine soul to shine, we must establish a true connection&mdash;one which is at the center of togetherness and the core of a kinder and gentler society&mdash;the kind Mr. Gladwell had in mind. It all starts with the quality of our interpersonal relationships.</p><p> Do you want stronger relationships? Then you might want to adopt these 7 approaches whether meeting someone for the first time or fellowshipping with friends and family.</p><h3> 1. Question your motives</h3><p> <br/> Would you have chosen a particular school, vacation, leisure activity, partner, place to live, or job (for examples) if you could never share the fact with anyone; if it were forever a secret with you? Or, was a significant part of your motivation, so that others could know about it? You must be brutally honest here, before even thinking about bringing something up in conversations. Because if you are truly excited about something, then by all means share it so that someone else might benefit from your experience. But if there is even an inkling that by bringing it up you present yourself as more popular, richer, smarter, more confident than someone else, then don&rsquo;t ask/don&rsquo;t tell.</p><h3> 2. Master small talk</h3><p> <br/> Small talk gets a bad name. But in fact, small talk avoids the tit-for-tat conversation that is at the heart of competition between people. With small talk, there is no pressure to come back with a vacation story to surpass the one you just heard. It often breaks the ice and allows people to connect on common ground. So discuss the weather, sports, what's your favorite recipe. </p><h3> 3. Ask and tell about emotions</h3><p> <br/> Make it common practice to ask how someone feels about certain current events or events in their life. Tell them how you feel about the same. Be careful not to start a debate as that will quickly deteriorate into a competition. Share for the sole purpose of connection and not in an attempt to win an argument.</p><h3> 4. Discuss politics and religion</h3><p> <br/> Commonly these are taboo topics; however, they can be rich for discussion and connection. Granted, not everyone with whom you connect will have read this blog, so there may be much judgment (on their part). As long as you don&rsquo;t judge, you can change the subject if the discussion starts developing into an argument. Agreeing to disagree is healthy and in the spirit of true collaboration.</p><h3> 5. Be silly and vulnerable</h3><p> <br/> Nothing makes people more comfortable with you than allowing yourself to be vulnerable. Joke around, be light, and occasionally even self-deprecating (but not at the expense of self-respect).</p><h3> 6. Be a person</h3><p> <br/> Often people feel uncomfortable in social situations, even parties. Why that is has to do with our primitive brain detecting a gathering of people as potential competitors, or even hostiles. Therefore, that brain may cause us to present ourselves in a powerful light. That is when we may feel the need to blurt out that we are a doctor, master carpenter, president of the PTA, or rich Wall Street exec. Remember to be a person, not your job. Instead marvel at the wonders of nature or the last inspiring book, movie, or television show you saw. </p><h3> 7. Be real</h3><p> <br/> All of us have experienced challenges, disappointments, stresses, and pain. Additionally, in our quietest moments, we have many questions about the meaning of life, the world, our very purpose. Authentic relationships are built upon our experiences and these questions. Don&rsquo;t pretend that you are any different; in other words, be real. One way to start being real is by adopting a don&rsquo;t ask/don&rsquo;t tell policy toward many of the material aspects of life. By doing so, not only will you establish newer, stronger, and genuine relationships, but you will play a vital role in creating a kinder and gentler society.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 19:03:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 19:03:36.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_QT9cBLs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-ask-dont-tell-7-steps-to-creating-genuine-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"6301\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 19:03:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 19:03:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-ask-dont-tell-7-steps-to-creating-genuine-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6300\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2891\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444402561039-1a9598a4ea00-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"515\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443099600,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

But we often lie to ourselves when we don&rsquo;t know the numbers. Gut decisions are good, but if we can access the numbers to help us make better decisions, the numbers are invaluable.</p><p> What numbers am I talking about? I&rsquo;m talking about results-based numbers, including the following:</p><p> 1. <strong>  Future Sales:  </strong> A number, presented monthly, of new prospects, hot prospects, potential sales, future clients in your pipeline, number of new clients, and sources. These will give us a goal and awareness of what we&rsquo;re expecting in the near future.</p><p> 2. <strong>  Referrals:  </strong> The number of referrals from clients, prospects, strategic alliances, etc. are invaluable to track. These numbers, viewed and discussed monthly, can help determine trends up or down, and help to identify areas of focus if the numbers are of concern.</p><p> 3. <strong>  Website Analytics: </strong>  Website analytics are critical. Accessing the data on how many people are coming to your website, when, what pages they visit, how long they are staying, where they came from, what is the bounce rate, etc. These are critical numbers to look at, probably weekly, to see if there are trends or problems. Problems could be that visitors are &ldquo;bouncing&rdquo; off your website before going anywhere but your home page. That is a bad sign for the compelling nature of your home page and probably needs to be changed. You probably already have analytics set up on your website and if not, you can set them up for free at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\" target=\"_blank\">   www.google.com/analytics  </a> </u> .</p><p> 4. <strong>  Social Media Analytics: </strong>  For professional purposes, we usually don&rsquo;t spend time on social media reaching out to clients, prospects, and strategic alliances for fun. We are doing it for business. So, compare the number of followers, interactions, connections, how many people are actually engaging with your social media sites, and the views on the content you post. If nothing is going on (which can be the case) then stop wasting the time to use social media OR try new things and see if your results change. Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter have analytics as well as programs like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite.com  </a> </u> .</p><p> 5. <strong>  Marketing Events: </strong>  The best numbers to track from a seminar or event you host are not just the number of people that came to the dinner or the number of sales closed. It is of course those numbers along with the number of appointments scheduled, appointments held, and the amount of the sales. These numbers need to coordinate with the amount of money spent on invitations, mailing lists, dinner, and handouts, as well as the time spent by staff on managing the event, following up, and the cost of materials printed. This is the only way to measure real seminar success, and it points us directly to areas of improvement.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t already looking at your business analytics, now is a great time to take a few moments and put in place some systems to measure your numbers. And if you already have access to the numbers, now is a great time to start looking at them consistently. With numbers you will begin making smarter decisions regarding your business.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 19:07:44.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 19:07:44.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Y9KJmYL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/numbers-dont-lie-so-why-dont-we-look-at-them-first/\", \"post_id\": \"6303\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 19:07:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 19:07:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"numbers-dont-lie-so-why-dont-we-look-at-them-first\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6302\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2892\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/light-man-hand-pen-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"650\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443095100,"author_id":322,"chart_url":""}

We assume that our children will grow up, leave the nest and strike out on their own at some point. They will finish their education, establish their own families and we&rsquo;ll have a quieter, emptier nest to deal with. For this generation, the reality has not been like that at all.According to reports,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.heartlightministries.org/2012/12/helping-a-boomerang-child/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   60 percent  </a> </u>  of parents are providing financial support to their children well into adulthood. In some instances, these young adults are still receiving money from their parents in their late 30s!

At the same time, you don&rsquo;t want to forego your own dream of having a comfortable retirement because of your child, either. Can you save for retirement and help your adult children too?</p><h3> Help Your Adult Children: Start by Talking</h3><li> <strong>  Talking about money can be challenging. </strong></li>You may have been raised to believe that it was rude to talk about how much money someone made or what they had. If your child approaches you about getting some financial help, the first thing you need to find out is how much help he or she needs and what it is for.<li> <strong>  Separate &ldquo;needs&rdquo; from &ldquo;wants.&rdquo; </strong></li>There is a difference between someone who has run into financial difficulty due to a job loss and who is actively looking for work and a person who needs money to go on an expensive vacation. While you may decide to provide support in the first instance, it may be harder for you to justify paying in the second one, especially if it means that you will have a hard time covering your own expenses.<li> <strong>  Get help from a professional financial advisor if you need it. </strong></li>Talking about money is a loaded subject that can bring up a number of other emotions, such as anger, resentment, jealousy, and bitterness. If the conversation is not handled delicately it can create a rift in your relationship with your child that can take a long time to heal. Enlist the help of a <u> <a href=\"http://www.rhondasherwood.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial advisor </a></u> who can help to keep the conversation on topic.<li> <strong>  Talk to your child about his or her financial situation and plans going forward. </strong></li>Your goal should be to offer a &ldquo;hand up&rdquo; to your child who needs it. Avoid offering a &ldquo;hand out.&rdquo; Ask your child about his or her plans to make sure that he or she gets on track toward independence within a timeframe that the two of you can agree on.<li> <strong>  Decide whether the money is going to be a gift or a loan. </strong></li>If the money is a loan, you&rsquo;ll need to put the terms in writing. Write out a payment plan, including an interest schedule. Both of you will need to sign it. If you are giving your child a gift, you may want to record it, too. If you have more than one child, it may cause resentment in the family if the other siblings don&rsquo;t receive help at the same time, even if they don&rsquo;t need financial assistance.<li> <strong>  Make sure that you don&rsquo;t jeopardize your own retirement cash flow to help your children. </strong></li>It can be difficult to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to an adult child, but you need to consider your own retirement needs as well.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 19:13:18.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 19:13:18.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_XJyhXkz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/can-you-save-for-retirement-and-help-your-adult-children-too/\", \"post_id\": \"6305\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 19:13:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 19:13:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"can-you-save-for-retirement-and-help-your-adult-children-too\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6306\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2893\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pexels-photo-large_3.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"444\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443114000,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

You&rsquo;re going to set goals for things you love. You have insight into a good perspective regarding how to look at them, making sure you enjoy the journey toward achieving them. And you want to set the bar high. So how do we bring it all together? How do we make the best attempt toward achieving these great heights for the things we love? What do we need?</p><h3> You need a map. The weather forecast would be nice too.</h3><p> <br/> You need a map. You need a plan. For most of you, up to this point in your life, someone else has put the map together for you. It&rsquo;s been a boss, a coach, a teacher, or your parents.</p><p> What is the first thing the teacher hands you when you go into class? When you walk into the classroom on the first day&mdash;or perhaps they place it out on the Internet&mdash;what do they hand you? There it is&mdash;the syllabus&mdash;classes one through forty-eight in all their glory. There is every topic we&rsquo;re going to cover for the next sixteen weeks. There it is. Why? Because the teacher knows, &ldquo;For me to do my job, for us to hit our goals for this class, and for my students to learn what they need to know, we need to go through all this stuff.&rdquo; The teacher&rsquo;s not going to roll out of bed on week fifteen and say, &ldquo;Huh. What do I feel like teaching today?&rdquo; No! There needs to be a plan&mdash;a map! And the teacher just gave it to you!</p><p> When you get out of school, the fun really starts because you get to play Magellan yourself. You get to build your own map. If you don&rsquo;t know who Magellan is, then you need to go take a history class. That map you build will serve as your guide.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t want just the map. I&rsquo;d like to know the weather too. I&rsquo;d love to have the map and the weather. But unfortunately, you&rsquo;re not going to have the weather. You&rsquo;re not going to see the storms coming. You&rsquo;re not going to see the curveballs and the sliders people are throwing at your head. Here&rsquo;s the bad part: the further away your goal is from today, the more storms you&rsquo;ll encounter. Here&rsquo;s the worst part: the further away your goal is from today, the greater the likelihood that somewhere along that way, you&rsquo;re going to fall out of love with that goal. Why?</p><p> Why do we fall out of love with something? It isn&rsquo;t going well! Does this sound familiar? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired. I can&rsquo;t remember why I loved this in the first place. I&rsquo;ve been at this for so long. I don&rsquo;t even know why I got started.&rdquo; You are going to feel that way, so I&rsquo;d like to help you avoid that. The map does that. The map is there so when your life gets interrupted and things aren&rsquo;t going well, it shows you how to get back on track. The map shows you how to make the adjustments to get back on track.</p><p> The map also shows you how far you&rsquo;ve come. &ldquo;Whoa&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already gone fifty miles! I only have ten more to go!&rdquo; Seeing progress nurtures your psyche. It nourishes it. It helps you build self-esteem. That nurtured psyche helps you weather the emotional and mental storms. When you get fatigued and want to throw in the towel, you can look at the map to see how far you&rsquo;ve progressed. It helps you remember why you started in the first place.</p><p> Another great attribute of the map&mdash;or you all have those Garmins or GPS devices&mdash;is it gives you the fastest route. It&rsquo;ll give you an alternate route if you need one. It helps you get there as fast as possible.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s never too late or too early to become the person you are capable of being.</h3><p> <br/> I have a story for you. I consider this to be the best story I could come up with to illustrate a long-term, difficult goal. It also happens to be a golf story, which I thought was a little on the nose considering why we&rsquo;re here today. This story also falls under the category of it&rsquo;s never too late or too early to become the person you are capable of being. It&rsquo;s never too late if you&rsquo;re still breathing.</p><p> I came to golf late in life&mdash;much later than any of you. I know many of you play and some of you don&rsquo;t. I was thirty years old when I started playing. I didn&rsquo;t have any coaching or take any lessons when I started. I played for seven years, and I tried to play as well as I could by mimicking some of the great professional players. I read the golf books and magazines. I practiced hitting golf balls.</p><p> When I was thirty-seven or so, approximately ten years ago, I decided to commit myself to becoming the best player I could possibly be. I wondered how good I could become if I had proper instruction and commitment to the game. I also thought becoming a better player would enhance my enjoyment of the game.</p><p> So I went to see a coach named Kevin. I walked in on the first day, and he said, &ldquo;Welcome to the program. I think you&rsquo;re going to like it. The first thing you need to do is hit a golf ball or two. Then we&rsquo;ll talk about what you&rsquo;d like to get out of the program.&rdquo;</p><p> He hooked me up to these ridiculous contraptions and wrapped cords around my head, shoulders, and waist. There were video cameras everywhere. I hit the golf ball with a seven iron. He videotaped it. We sat down, and he said, &ldquo;OK, thanks. What would you like to get out of this program?&rdquo;</p><p> I said, &ldquo;Kevin, it&rsquo;s really simple. There are only two goals I care about. I want to become a scratch golfer [zero handicap], and I want to have a lot of fun doing it.&rdquo;</p><p> After he picked himself up off the floor and wiped away his tears of laughter, he composed himself long enough to say, &ldquo;OK, let me take another look at the video of your swing.&rdquo; He looked at the swing again and then looked back at me.</p><p> I asked, &ldquo;Well? How long? How long before I become a scratch golfer?&rdquo;</p><p> He looked at me with a stoic face and deadpanned, &ldquo;Three years.&rdquo;</p><p> I asked, &ldquo;Three years? That&rsquo;s a long time.&rdquo;</p><p> He said, &ldquo;No, actually it&rsquo;s not. Most people are never going to achieve that, and the ones that do usually require much more time. You have a pretty decent swing, so if you work really smart and put the effort in, you can get there.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Hit another ball.&rdquo;</p><p> I got the contraptions back on. I took my stance over the ball, and just as I was about to hit it, I looked up at him and asked, &ldquo;When you say three years&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p> As the speech bubble was still hanging over my head, he replied, &ldquo;That means every single day for the next three years, you will have a golf club in your hand doing something I have instructed you to do.&rdquo; I thought,Goodness, that&rsquo;s something like a thousand hours or so of practice.</p><p> I said, &ldquo;This is important to me. I&rsquo;ll do whatever I need to, but I need a plan.&rdquo;</p><p> He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have one for you next week.&rdquo;</p><p> The next week, I went back. There it was&mdash;three years of the program. The first year focused on the backswing, the second on the downswing, and the third on the short game, which included chipping, putting, and sand play.</p><p> The point is the map shows you how to get to where you&rsquo;re going. A long-term, multiyear plan can be very overwhelming when you don&rsquo;t understand where you are going. You don&rsquo;t become CEO of the company overnight. You don&rsquo;t go from a nonrunner to running a marathon in six months.</p><p> Here is another key point to remember. We spoke about setting goals very high for things you love. If they are truly, truly major goals in your life, then you can only have so many at one time. That means two or three or so. If you have too many, you&rsquo;ll spread yourself too thin and won&rsquo;t be successful in accomplishing them.</p><p> Think in terms of a pyramid or triangle. At the top, you have a few major goals in your life, and you set them very high. On the next layer, there are more short-term or intermediary goals, which are stepping stones to the top of the pyramid.</p><p> Going back to my golf example, when I returned for the second lesson, I looked at the plan Kevin had prepared, and the goal became manageable in my mind. I realized, &ldquo;The first twenty weeks it&rsquo;ll be snowing outside. I&rsquo;ll be in a studio performing drills and shaping the way I think about the swing and the proper body motion. In the spring, I&rsquo;ll start hitting more golf balls outside at the driving range. In the summer, I&rsquo;ll be playing more and continually practicing. I&rsquo;ll work with Kevin once each month to make sure the backswing stays in order. When the summer is over, I&rsquo;ll go back to the studio, and I&rsquo;ll move onto the next phase&mdash;the downswing and so on.&rdquo; All of a sudden, it became easier for me to digest this lofty goal. I had a blueprint.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s something you need to remember about big goals. I realize everyone wants a finished product right away, but you need to be patient. You should enjoy yourself along the way. As you work toward something&mdash;and anybody who plays golf knows this&mdash;your progress will not always be linear and rising. You will have setbacks. Embrace those setbacks. You know what setbacks do? They tap you on the shoulder and say, &ldquo;Hello! Take a pause and examine things. What&rsquo;s going wrong? Rethink things.&rdquo; When you take that pause and step back, you often will subsequently take a giant leap forward. The map, at this point, is extremely crucial because it keeps you from meandering and gets you back on track quickly.</p><p> Back to the golf story. After four years of this training, practicing, and playing, I reached my goal. Yes, I was a year tardy, but hey, stuff came up. Life sometimes interrupts you and takes you off your desired path and timetable. At that moment, four years later, something undetectable happened. I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying myself. I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying golf. I had never anticipated this could happen. I had just reached a pinnacle I had worked so diligently toward, and I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying myself anymore. I didn&rsquo;t know why until I realized how difficult it would be to maintain that level of proficiency. In essence, getting there as I watched myself continually improve was much more enjoyable than being there at the pinnacle and needing to stay there.</p><p> The big lesson I want you to understand is that a goal can never be an endpoint. Regardless of what goal you set or how high you set it, it should never be an endpoint. Technically it can never be an endpoint because time keeps moving. The world keeps spinning. Whatever goals you set in life, however big they are, they will always be mere stepping stones to something else. I don&rsquo;t know what that something else is, but whatever it is, goals will get you there.</p><h3> There is no such thing as wasted time.</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s one last point I&rsquo;d like to make before we wrap up this section. All the hard work you put into achieving your goals will never be wasted. It will never be lost. There is absolutely no such thing as wasted time. You will always learn something.

{"original_id":2820,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Half the Money You Spend on Client Experience is Wasted","link":"half-the-money-you-spend-on-client-experience-is-wasted","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Well, that's a pretty bold statement coming from someone who advocates designing and delivering a great customer experience! <br/> <br/> Hold tight. It's not quite as crazy as it sounds! <br/> <br/> I came across this quote the other day... <br/> <br/> Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half. -John Wanamaker <br/> <br/> ... and it got me thinking, as these things do sometimes. <br/> <br/> What exactly does that quote mean? I've seen a few interpretations, but I think the most common one revolves around not being able to qualify or quantify the effects of advertising. Which ad brought customers into the store, the weekday or the weekend ad? the radio ad or the newspaper ad? which one caused them to buy? etc. <br/> <br/> And that led me to think about a couple different interpretations that can be applied to customer experience. <br/> <br/> First, it made me think about how to  <strong>  measure the effectiveness of your customer experience efforts </strong>  or how to make sure the improvements you make are meaningful to your customers - and to the business. What are some of the metrics you can use to measure your overall efforts? Some examples are listed below, with the first four or five reflecting the voice of the customer, while the rest represent their actions.</p><li> satisfaction scores</li><li> effort scores </li><li> ease of doing business score</li><li> net promoter scores</li><li> actual referrals </li><li> retention rates</li><li> renewal rates</li><li> order/purchase size</li><li> repurchase rate</li><li> cross-sells</li><li> upsells</li><li> customer lifetime value <br/>  </li><p> If your customer experience isn't worthy, it will be reflected in these metrics. But, to the point of Wanamaker's quote, how do you know which half of your CX dollars/efforts resulted in the uptick of these metrics? You've really got to make sure you track and measure your improvements at a much more micro level to capture the real effect of their impact (and then correlate them to overall outcomes). If they're not working, figure out why not and redesign. <br/> <br/> Another angle the quote made me think about:  <strong>  don't go crazy and think you need to fix everything. </strong> Be systematic about your approach to customer experience design and improvements. Do consider the ROI, but most importantly, consider what's most important to customers. Do those things, fix those aspects, that are most impactful to them. If you make improvements where improvements aren't needed or to those areas that aren't important to your customers or don't move the needle for them, you are wasting your money. Find out what's important to them and start there. How do you find out? Map their journeys. Listen to them. Ask them. Do some analysis (e.g., key driver), and prioritize improvement opportunities. <br/> <br/> And, finally, an angle that is related to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/01/do-your-customers-talk-about-your.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advertising  </a> </u> :  <strong>  stop wasting money on advertising to position your brand. </strong> Remember, the experience  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/01/actions-really-do-speak-louder-than.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   speaks louder than words  </a> </u> . If your advertising is not aligned with your experience, if you say you (are going to) do something and then don't or say you are something that you're not, then you've actually wasted all of your advertising dollars. Spend (or waste) advertising dollars, and customers will be fooled; (re)design the experience, and they will come. <br/> <br/> How will you avoid wasting half (or all) of your CX budget? <br/> <br/> Listen to customers and determine what's important and impactful to them. Identify your key moments of truth. Improve the experience when and where it matters. Measure the specific improvements. Redesign where you've fallen short. <br/> <br/> Focus on the experience, and the business will come.  <br/> <br/> Starbucks is not an advertiser; people think we are a great marketing company, but in fact we spend very little money on marketing and more money on training our people than advertising. -Howard Schultz</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-23 19:21:25.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-23 19:21:25.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_4u9XEAW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/half-the-money-you-spend-on-client-experience-is-wasted/\", \"post_id\": \"6310\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-23 19:21:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-23 19:21:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"half-the-money-you-spend-on-client-experience-is-wasted\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6309\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2895\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Money-Down-the-Drain.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"607\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443094200,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2821,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is It a Good Idea to Call Yourself A \"Boutique\"?","link":"is-it-a-good-idea-to-call-yourself-a-boutique","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The way you describe your approach to customer service may be constraining your growth, limiting your referrals, and creating a succession problem you don&rsquo;t realize.</p><h3> Are any of these statements similar to how you describe your firm?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;We are a boutique financial services firm.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;We provide highly personalized services for that small company feel.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;We give you the attention you will not receive at a big Wall Street firm.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> If so, you may be working to impress people with your level of service. You may be working on setting yourself apart from banks and national brokerage firms. You may be using it as shorthand to describe the kind of intimate relationship you establish with clients. You may also be creating problems for yourself inadvertently.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s deconstruct propositions like this and see the deliberate and accidental messages that are being communicated. What is it you are promising clients when you talk like this?</p><li> Personal service</li><li> Accessibility</li><li> Customized advice</li><li> Personal attention <br/>  </li><p> You are promising to know a lot about them. And that this knowledge will enable you to fulfill all of their explicit financial needs and anticipate many of the unspoken ones.</p><h3> And that you can accomplish this because you are a small firm.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Your size means that every individual client is important. </strong> It means that the owners can have personal relationships with all of the families the firm serves. It means that no one will be reduced to a number or be lost in the system.</p><p> <strong>  So what&rsquo;s the problem? </strong> To oversimplify, it implies a promise not to grow and never to leave. The implication is that the firm will be overly reliant on the principals. The challenge is that to deliver on these promises over the long run, a firm must grow. And the company needs to be in a position to outlive the owner. I have seen the inherent conflict play out in client advisory board meetings. Clients want you to succeed. In some way, they equal weight your success with theirs. And at the same time they have concerns about you bringing on new clients. They believe, probably with some justification, that if you have more clients than you will have less time for them. For most firms, clients will still refer their friends but there may be some level of discomfort about it. Keep in mind clients do not refer to help you but rather to help the friend who has a need you can solve. But if they refer several people or if they hear that you have been bringing on lots of new clients, they will begin to worry about whether their service will suffer. In at least one unusual case, I observed an outright reluctance to provide referrals because of that fear.</p><p> The problem arises from the way the value proposition is framed. The flaw in the logic is in equating high levels of service with a small organization. Great service, including personal service, can come from any size organization provided a system is in place to deliver it.</p><h3> Unique service can come from a boutique firm.</h3><p> <br/> Boutique implies small. But, according to my Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s collegiate dictionary, it also implies &ldquo;a small company that offers highly specialized services or products.&rdquo; So if your firm only deals with real estate or private equity you may be a boutique. If your firm offers customized service to institutions, nonprofits, business owners, families and individuals, you are not a boutique.</p><p> <strong>  I know small advisory firms that pride themselves on delivering Ritz Carlton service. But Ritz Carlton is not a small company. </strong> They own 89 hotels and have 35,000 employees. That high level of personalized service is clearly not limited to the realm of small companies.</p><p> Some advisors believe they can offer superior service because of how much they know about each individual client. Of all the companies that serve me, want to guess who knows me best? Amazon. It knows a fair amount about what I eat, about what I wear, and it certainly knows my interests based on what I read. I know it is not a person who is going through all that information and making helpful suggestions. As long as it helps me find what I&rsquo;m looking for and gives me ideas occasionally about things I am happy to hear about and had not thought of myself, the fact that it is the system as opposed to a human never even occurs to me.</p><p> The fact that large, national companies (banks, for example) provide impersonal service is not because they are big. It is a policy decision. It&rsquo;s a choice. Those organizations could build a system for personalizing service and creating a great customer experience, like Amazon has, and they have chosen to give other strategic objectives priority. They don&rsquo;t provide lousy service simply because they are big and you don&rsquo;t provide great service simply because you are small.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s get &ldquo;small&rdquo; and, yes, even &ldquo;boutique&rdquo; out of our value propositions. Here is a better way to approach it. If your firm delivers great service, be specific about what defines that service. Draft policies and procedures and manage to them so that everyone in the organization is in agreement on what great service is and their performance is measured against those standards.</p><p> If you provide customized service, how do you tailor it to specific clients? I am confident that it is not simply a free-for-all where you give every client whatever they might want. You probably have specific ways you will adjust what you do for clients to conform to specific kinds of preferences. Let prospective clients know about those processes.</p><p> <strong>  Tell prospective clients what they can expect if they sign up with you. Describe the experience of being a client. </strong> And then have processes to make sure you deliver on them.</p><p> In the end, these specific descriptions of what you do and how you will do it are more powerful than simply saying &ldquo;customized&rdquo; or &ldquo;personalized.&rdquo; One benefit to you is that you can make sure you carry through on what you promise. A bigger benefit is that you can then train everyone you hire to deliver that same experience. At that point, anyone who becomes a client of the firm will get that same great service. They will not need to rely on having access to the owner. The firm becomes scalable. Growth is not as scary a prospect to clients because the organization can grow and still deliver on its promises. And you can implement a succession plan that is less terrifying or traumatic to your clients.</p><p> Heck, you might even be able to take a vacation without checking email.</p><p> Offering a &ldquo;small-company feel&rdquo; can be great if you run a delicatessen or a neighborhood bar. For investment advisors, it is better to have a series of processes, designed with your target client preferences in mind, that systematically deliver on a client experience.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 14:15:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 14:15:19.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_n0ySCiO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/is-it-a-good-idea-to-call-yourself-a-boutique/\", \"post_id\": \"6312\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 14:15:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 14:15:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"is-it-a-good-idea-to-call-yourself-a-boutique\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6311\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2896\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-24-at-10.57.40-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"469\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443180600,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2822,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Tips to Fund Your Studies Abroad","link":"5-tips-to-fund-your-studies-abroad","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aureusconsult\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Amos Fong  </u> </a> | <u>  Aureus Consulting </u> The numerous advantages of studying abroad have often been proclaimed in the press and by higher education experts. With benefits like instilling independence and cultural sensitivity, along with promoting educational exposure, the perceived prestige and diverse networking prospects that an international education brings, it is unsurprising that an increasing number of students leave their countries every year to pursue their degrees overseas. <strong>  However, studying abroad can be extremely costly. </strong> <strong>  Here, we will cover five alternate ways to fund your studies that may help alleviate the strain on your (or your family's) personal finances. </strong></p><h3> University Financial Aid, Bursaries and Scholarships.</h3>Before you look anywhere else, note that most universities offer some form of financial aid to students from underprivileged backgrounds. If you meet the necessary criteria, this is definitely an option you should consider. <u> <a href=\"https://www.internationalstudent.com/schools_awarding_aid/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Some </a></u> top US universities offer Need-Blind and Full-Need Admissions to international students, while <u> <a href=\"http://www.edupass.org/finaid/undergraduate.phtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  others </a></u> offer partial financial aid. If financial aid isn't for you, it might be worthwhile to look into the scholarships offered by your university. Academic scholarships usually don't include a bond, though they often come with certain academic conditions to be met. But if you're looking into alternate sources of finance and intend to work hard at maintaining your academic performance anyway (we hope), academic scholarships should be an attractive option for you. Universities in different countries like the <u> <a href=\"http://studyusa.com/en/a/536/scholarships-for-international-students-planning-to-study-in-the-usa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  US </a></u> and <u> UK</u> offer different ranges of scholarships, so do your research!<h3> Public Sector Scholarships.</h3>While we're on the topic, another important scholarship provider is the public sector. A public sector scholarship often generates mixed opinions, with many lamenting that it often comes with strings attached (Singapore: 6 year bond). There is also a common concern that by working for a governmental organization, you will lose out to your counterparts in the private sector, deal constantly with bureaucracy and not necessarily do work related to your field of study. However, others view it as guaranteed employment and job security upon graduation, a chance to obtain insights into public sector organizations and a valuable opportunity to broaden their skills and expand their networks. Whether you dream of entering a public sector career or feel that obtaining the funds to pursue your education trumps all, do give some thought before committing to this option. And don't be surprised if you face heavy competition when <u> <a href=\"http://brightsparks.com.sg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  applying </a></u>. With their guarantee of employment upon graduation and generous financial coverage, public sector scholarships are an increasingly attractive option to many.<h3> Private Sector Scholarships.</h3>If you're looking for the financial coverage of a scholarship without the purported red tape and bureaucracy endemic to a public sector career, maybe you should consider a private sector scholarship instead. While not as common as public sector scholarships, they are industry-specific and as scholars are often groomed into management positions within their parent organization, this can provide a valuable springboard into your ideal career after graduation. As with public scholarships, private sector scholarships often come with a bond and academic conditions to meet. However, these scholarships are often more subject-specific, so you might face less competition when applying.<h3> Employer Sponsorship.</h3>If you work, your employer might sponsor you to take a relevant full-time course, on the condition that you continue working for them for a given period after graduation. While this is similar to a private sector scholarship, the key difference is that rather than having a dedicated sponsorship program, firms are more likely to offer funding on an ad-hoc basis to existing employees who can present a convincing case. Sponsorships are also usually limited for graduate studies for those who already possess work experience and whose employer sees a Return on Investment in developing them further.<h3> Educational Loans.</h3>Finally, there are dreaded educational loans. While often perceived as a last resort, educational loans can be a welcome source of finance to some, considering that they often don't involve collateral and sometimes only need to be repaid once the student has started working. However, student loan terms differ drastically between countries, so it is recommended that you check with your country's student loan providers. Of course, in today's economy, employment prospects are rather dim and no one wants to graduate saddled with debt. But if you've committed yourself to pursuing an overseas education and think paying back a loan for a few years after graduation is a necessary evil, this might be an option for you.Regardless if you are experiencing financial difficulties or merely wish to lighten the load on your family's finances, many different sources of funding are available for those who intend to study overseas. A quality education is always a worthwhile investment, so explore your options by speaking to your university and local scholarship providers, or seek the advice of individuals who have embarked on this journey before.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 14:24:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 14:24:42.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ek7PrDz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-tips-to-fund-your-studies-abroad/\", \"post_id\": \"6314\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 14:24:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 14:24:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-tips-to-fund-your-studies-abroad\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6313\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2897\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-24-at-10.45.37-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"544\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443200400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The ad is simple: you can use your phone to pay in over a million stores, and in this version shows AMEX, Bank of America and MasterCard as the stars (the UK ad has Nationwide, HSBC and MasterCard).  Interestingly, these brands have not necessarily paid to be featured in the ad, as I discovered when talking with Nationwide who were chosen because they were one of the first UK banks to contact Apple when they launched Apple Pay.</p><h3> Then we have Android Pay, which is similar.</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-24-at-11.08.46-AM-2.png\" width=\"848\"/></p><p> click to view</p><p> The main difference is the music and feel of the ad but, apart from that and a lack of fingereprints, this could be Apple Pay.</p><h3> Finally, Samsung Pay is different.</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-24-at-11.11.54-AM-2.png\" width=\"849\"/></p><p> click to view</p><p> <strong>  The tagline is: It&rsquo;s not a phone, it&rsquo;s a Galaxy  </strong> and clearly is making the point that the iPhone is limited to pure NFC terminals.  Note the weird phone that appears in the middle and isn&rsquo;t accepted, but the Galaxy is.  I like it, and shows the differentiation of having a phone payment wallet that can be used with all pre-existing card terminals as well as NFC contactless.  This one doesn&rsquo;t feature any card schemes or banks, but just makes the point that you can use it everywhere.  Nice.</p><p> The real difference between the three ads and wallets is not my views though, but the interesting trail of comments under each ad from YouTube users.  For example, the Apple Pay meme goes something like this:</p><p> &ldquo;Comments are disabled for this video.&rdquo;</p><p> Aha.   As usual, Apple are control freaks.

You might think that due to the dynamic nature of our business environment, salespeople would face different challenges year by year. But, in fact, the results are relatively consistent.</p><p> The survey says&hellip;.</p><p> When asked what is the #1 challenge facing salespeople, the results are clear:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.admarco.net/inbound-marketing-messaging-sales-performance-blog/blog/the-widening-gap-between-sales-and-marketing-and-what-you-can-do-about-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #1 barrier to sales effectiveness in 2015 is the Lack of Qualified Leads &ndash; CSO Insight  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.admarco.net/inbound-marketing-messaging-sales-performance-blog/bid/102302/cso-insights-2015-sales-performance-optimization-survey-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #1 and #3 Top Sales Objectives in 2015 &ndash; CSO Insight  </a> </u> <li>  #1 &ndash; Capture New Accounts </li> <li>  #3 &ndash; Optimize Lead Generation </li></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkrogue/2015/08/05/top-inside-sales-challenges-in-2015-new-research/\" target=\"_blank\">   #1 Challenge facing Inside Sales Reps in 2015&ndash; Quantity and Quality of Leads &ndash; AA-ISP  </a> </u> <br/>  </li><p> With that said, one of the greatest struggles of sales and marketing teams is tackling the task of generating more leads that convert to opportunities. But, that&rsquo;s not the only issue. Sales teams also often wrestle with answering the what, when, and how of leads: &ldquo;What should I do with these leads? When should prospects be contacted, or should they be placed in a nurture campaign? How do I qualify these leads?&rdquo;</p><p> There are 4 common mistakes sales teams make when addressing these questions:</p><h3> 1.  All Inbound leads are Routed to Sales</h3><p> In his insightful book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Sales-Acceleration-Formula-Technology/dp/1119047072\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Sales Acceleration Formula  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markroberge\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mark Roberge  </a> </u>  discusses how marketing teams will incorrectly send all inbound inquiries to sales.</p><p> In the scenario he describes, marketing increases their inbound lead creation from a few dozen leads per month to nearly 500. You&rsquo;d think WOW &ndash; the marketing team is my new hero, right? Well, in most cases the answer is no, simply due to the fact that many of these leads will be unqualified. Included in these leads can be employees of your own company, people who submit fake contact data on your forms just to get your content, or even PhD students doing research for a report.</p><p> What Mark wisely suggests is that all inbound leads are filtered first to ensure they are not only legit, but they are also a great fit for your company. This extra step will ensure that these leads get the attention they deserve from sales, while also ensuring that no time is wasted on poor quality leads.</p><h3> 2. Taking too Long to Respond to Leads</h3><p> Engagement is, in the majority of cases, the most important criteria in determining the quality of an inbound lead. If someone is on your website looking around and is compelled to reach out to you, the clock starts ticking. Literally, that very second.</p><p> Craig Rosenberg, aka the funnelholic, took some time to study the impact of responding to leads quickly and published his results in the blog post,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.funnelholic.com/2013/12/18/best-practices-for-following-up-on-inbound-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Best Practices for Following Up on Inbound Leads  </a> </u> . What he found was that if you connect with an inbound lead within 5 SECONDS &ndash; YES 5 SECONDS &ndash; you are 30% more likely to qualify that lead.</p><p> Also, based on research from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.leadresponsemanagement.org/lrm_study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   InsideSales  </a> </u> , your connect rate decreases by 10X if you call after the first hour in which a lead is submitted. Based on these studies, it should be obvious that the faster you react, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to connect with your leads.</p><h3> 3. Spending too Much Time on the Wrong Leads</h3><p> This usually occurs when you have too few inbound leads or you are doing outbound prospecting to generate interest in your product or service.</p><p> The way this typically occurs is that reps will naturally be drawn to people that are friendly and will take their call anytime. While this is great for a reps ego, people that are available all day/every day are very rarely decision makers. So, the time invested in talking with them, while not completely wasted, is still misdirected.</p><p> Once you have determined your  <u>  Ideal Client Profile </u> , make sure that you spend your time selectively qualifying leads that meet your criteria. You may find you won&rsquo;t get as many conversations, but at least the conversations you do get will be with someone for whom your product was built.</p><h3> 4. Not Knowing How to Prioritize Leads</h3><p> You&rsquo;ve got your coffee and sit down to start your calling. You do a little mental exercise to pump yourself up, you pick up your phone, and dial the first name on your list.</p><p> WAIT! Is that who you should be calling? Based on #2 above, you should call any lead that has come in within the last hour first&hellip;and, the sooner the better. Then, you should look through your lead list and sort them by lead score, that is, if you do lead scoring. In this post,  <u>  Flip Top </u> , provides some helpful tips on how you should prioritize your lead follow-up.</p><p> If you are just picking up the phone and thoughtlessly calling with no regard to why and what order &ndash; stop &ndash; and refocus on a prioritization schedule. Your sales manager should be able to help you with this, too.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 18:30:28.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 18:30:28.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_biYFHTL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-making-mistakes-with-your-sales-leads/\", \"post_id\": \"6321\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 18:30:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 18:30:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-making-mistakes-with-your-sales-leads\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6320\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2899\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1442947834688-906754688969.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"396\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443267900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2825,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Co-Planning Deepens the Advisor-Client Relationship","link":"how-co-planning-deepens-the-advisor-client-relationship","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Anderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI Practically Speaking  </u> </a>  </p><p> This originally appeared on SEI's Practically Speaking.</p><p> Maybe it is the start of a new daily schedule in the household, or the thought of our sons hitting the books again &ndash; for me, fall is always a time to get serious about things. This is also the time of year that I see advisors stepping up their meetings and reviews with clients. And with the recent volatility, it is a great time for you to meet with clients and collaboratively plan &ndash; or co-plan &ndash; with them.</p><p> <strong>  We&rsquo;ve been doing it wrong </strong> <br/> Traditionally, financial plans have always been created &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; or &ldquo;for&rdquo; the client, not with the client. Whether it is on a spreadsheet (or the back of an envelope) or using sophisticated software, the advisor typically works long hours, starting with the client&rsquo;s current situation and projecting out if the client can reach his/her/their goals. The plan is presented and almost immediately forgotten by the client, as they go back to their busy lives.</p><p> Advisors, of course, enable clients to forget, since most of their ongoing communications are about investment accounts and performance, rather than a plan. Joint ownership of the plan can make for a better, more successful relationship. Joint ownership of the plan can keep the client focused on the right things. So how do you get them to co-own the plan with you?</p><p> <strong>  1.  Remember that (paper)less is more. </strong> <br/> The first thing about co-planning is starting with the paperwork. Think about the hours that you and your client put into the planning process, especially all the paperwork they have to provide (account statements, wills, etc.). You have the data; share it back.</p><p> Many advisors are now using client portals, so there is two-way communications and sharing between the client and advisor. Allow clients access to the plan and any updated information in real time, rather than waiting for meetings or snail mail. Think about it &ndash; for many clients, this will be the first time that both spouses know exactly where all their financial information lives. Sharing and communicating this important information is a critical first step in co-planning.</p><p> <strong>  2. &ldquo;Test drive&rdquo; decisions in an easy-to-understand way using planning software. </strong> <br/> The second area of co-planning is really about the software. After the release of our whitepaper, &ldquo; <u>  The Next Wave of Financial Planning </u> ,&rdquo; we were inundated with questions about which software advisors should use and what we would recommend. I think many of the people who asked were disappointed (or at least surprised) in our answer; we typically suggested that they look at their existing software first.</p><p> Many of the newer planning software vendors, as well as updated versions from the more established firms, offer scenario planning. Think about the power of being able to visually show the consequences of a retirement nest egg if a client retires at 65 vs. 70. What does cash flow look like if little Johnnie chooses a state school vs. an Ivy League one?</p><p> Remember, don&rsquo;t look for new planning software &ndash; look within first. Are you utilizing all the tools that you have available to you? Do you need to retrain yourself and your staff on what it can do? Maximize your current technology first, before turning to something different. You may also want to start with some of your more tech-savvy clients &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see how they feel the ownership of the co-plan.</p><p> <strong>  3. Show and tell in a big way. </strong> <br/> As I visit advisors&rsquo; offices around the country, I have noticed a few trends as it relates to planning and services meetings. Flat screen TVs and large monitors have been pushed into the conference rooms, instead of the waiting rooms. I&rsquo;ve also seen advisors travel with laptop projectors for use in a client&rsquo;s  home or business. (I know there are a number of you who use video conferencing for the update and planning meetings, too.) When the advisor and the client are looking at the screen and working together, it&rsquo;s clear that everyone is more invested in the plan&rsquo;s success.</p><p> <strong>  In it together </strong> <br/> A few weeks ago, we got a supply list from our kids&rsquo; teachers. Crayons and colored pencils have given way to calculators and flash drives.

{"original_id":2826,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Giving Advice: Active, Reflective, or Validating","link":"giving-advice-active-reflective-or-validating","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It happens daily. The friend, colleague, or family member who comes to you with that seemingly innocent question, &ldquo;What do you think I should do?&rdquo; From there they spiral out in all directions like the Octopus carnival ride from days gone by. They are ever spinning at breakneck speeds, dizzying heights, and around a central point without ever really getting The Point. Then, after feeling fully satisfied that you have absorbed all the necessary facts and moving parts of the present situation, they once again ask, &ldquo;What do you think I should do?&rdquo;</p><p> You want to help. Really. Why? Because you are a decent human being and your people know they can come to you for assistance. Your history with them has proven that you are a good listener, empathetic and wise beyond all measure. And, let&rsquo;s face it, nobody else answered their phone call so there is that. I digress. The real problem you&rsquo;re having, however, is what are they really asking? Do they want you to listen? Are they wanting your expertise in such matters? Are they seeking validation for a course of action they are already taking? Are they trying to win an argument of right vs. wrong with some external third party you know nothing about? Really, without knowing more, you cannot truly be of service.</p><p> This is where I come in. After years of coaching, leadership development, educational leadership, social services, etcetera and so forth, I&rsquo;ve learned a thing or two about advice giving and those who ask for it. I&rsquo;m going to share it here. Before you can give advice to anybody, you need to know what they are truly seeking. Below are the filters and steps I have created to ascertain the true nature of the often confusing question, &ldquo;What do you think I should do?&rdquo;</p><h3> I.  Active Advice</h3><p> Defined as the individual who is seeking concrete action steps to reach a predetermined goal. This person is generally not interested in the emotional aspects of the goal but rather the pragmatic steps necessary to reach that goal.</p><h3>  Key Indicators</h3><li> <strong>  Suggests movement </strong> &ndash; This individual can be identified by list making, note taking, immediate feedback and the continual what&rsquo;s next inquiry. There is rarely a pause unless it is for restatement and clarification.</li><li> <strong>  Frames outcomes </strong> &ndash; This individual uses if this then that dialogue. If I burn 3,500 calories on Tuesday, I will be one pound lighter on Wednesday is a key indicator of a framing mindset.</li><li> <strong>  Creates urgency </strong>  &ndash; Much aligned with suggests movement from above, there is no pause in the dialogue and no reflective speech. This person wants it done yesterday and that is the way it is.</li><li> <strong>  Defined by objectives </strong>  &ndash; Finally, you will know an active advice seeker because they have clear objectives and will insist that you become a part of their vision and path towards achieving them. If you decline the invitation, be prepared for disappointment and even a bit of hostility. They tend to see their objectives as global solutions and cannot understand why there will be any dissent amongst those invited to the table. <br/>  </li><h3> II.  Reflective Advice</h3><p> Defined as the individual seeking an external internal partner for discussion, feedback, and assessment. This person is not interested in immediate solutions but rather wanting to talk about the experience(s) involved in the process of achieving a particular goal which may or may not yet be fully determined.</p><h3> Key Indicators</h3><li> <strong>  Suggests internal discussion </strong> &ndash; While the individual has contacted you for advice, what they are seeking is a discussion partner to their own internal dialogue. People generally do this for one of two reasons: because they are unsure of their own abilities or they are unsure of their focus. Your role is not to solve or drive the conversation but to reflect their positions and keep the light on their self-perceptions. </li><li> <strong>  Frames desires </strong> &ndash; While the individual may not know the specific origin of their inquiry, much like the Octopus ride above, they will circle the center until they either stumble or are lead there. Your role is to reflect the individuals thoughts back to the center and frame the desired outcomes. This takes a lot of time commitment from the advice giver and is why some people burn out and don&rsquo;t answer the phone calls of people who do this more often than not. </li><li> <strong>  Creates options </strong> &ndash; Once the internal desire is created, identified, and committed to by the reflective advice you have both participated in, it is time to create the options that work best for the individual. While this may be simple in writing, if the purpose hasn&rsquo;t been clearly and meaningfully defined, expect resistance, denial, anger, and sadness. Failure to launch brings on the stages of grief and the internal chatter goes wild. Be prepared for more calls. </li><li> <strong>  Defined by potential </strong> &ndash; Reflective advice can be defined by both negative and positive potential. The negative reflector will continually ask things like, &ldquo;Is this good enough? What if I do this? This whole thing could blow up.&rdquo; On the other hand, the questions of the positive reflector look like this, &ldquo;Can you believe nobody has done this before? How hard can it really be? I&rsquo;m going to nail this!&rdquo; Once you hear that banter, you will know who you are talking to and can advise accordingly. <br/>  </li><h3> III. Validation</h3><p> The individual who contacts you isn&rsquo;t interested in what you have to say, offer, or contribute but rather they are seeking positive feedback and enmeshment that provides immediate kudos and gold stars for their already conceived plans. That&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t be helpful and your effort is a waste of your time but recognize that this is more of a great opportunity for you to see inside their mind with minimal effort of solution involvement from your end.</p><h3> Key Indicators</h3><li> <strong>  Suggests plan is set </strong>  &ndash; This is pretty straightforward. You will hear phrases such as, &ldquo;After spending 3 months working on it, I am launching my website tomorrow. Would you take a look at it tonight?&rdquo; &ldquo;I love the look of the bright orange I painted on the walls while you were away on business. What do you think?&rdquo; In no way, shape, or form are they asking for your honest feedback nor should you provide it. That is a fool&rsquo;s game and will only lead to mistrust, argument, and hurt feelings on the next (hopefully authentic) go round.</li><li> <strong>  Frames plan as success </strong> &ndash; You will feel as if you are either on a high pressure sales call or the individual is running for office and wants into your wallet. Either situation creates a visceral reaction due to the feeling of being trapped and limited in your desired feedback because you know they are sold on whatever goal they have set up and you are just a visitor to their banquet. Enjoy the feast but don&rsquo;t question the chef. Ever.</li><li> <strong>  Creates roadblocks to dialogue / input </strong> &ndash; The only phrase necessary in this segment? &ldquo;But&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Defined by resistance </strong>  &ndash;You will know your advice isn&rsquo;t truly welcomed and the octopus would rather seek its eternal high-fiving revolutions because the individual will tell you as much. Will they be gracious and tell you outright? Heavens, no! Should you disregard the above three indicators where I told you to not provide input and go ahead and do it (bless-your-heart), every single bit of insight, advice, and suggestion you provide will be met with the wall of, &ldquo;Here is why it won&rsquo;t work&hellip;&rdquo; Trust me. Test it for yourself. <br/>  </li><p> When you find yourself on the receiving end of the pseudo-flattering question, &ldquo;What Do You Think I Should Do?&rdquo; be prepared to do the investigative work to know what is really being asked. Is the individual seeking advice asking you to simply give advice or is there something else going on? Remember, advice comes cloaked in all sorts of fancy finery and is best given at face value. Identify it, name it, and proceed: Active, Reflective, or Validating. Now sit down, buckle up, and get ready to spin the advice they are truly asking for!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 18:43:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 18:43:24.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_onyttra.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/giving-advice-active-reflective-or-validating/\", \"post_id\": \"6326\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 18:43:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 18:43:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"giving-advice-active-reflective-or-validating\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6327\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2901\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pexels-photo-large_5.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"961\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443168000,"author_id":152,"chart_url":""}

The Power of Presence","link":"do-you-want-to-be-noticed-the-power-of-presence","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I recently coached a woman who had flown in from Jamaica to meet with me about how she presented herself within her company. A couple of weeks after she returned home, she shared a story that highlights how her professional presence had improved. <br/> <br/> &ldquo;When I returned to work, I received many compliments on one of my outfits. I had worn that clothing to work 10 times in the past and no one had complimented me about it. No one! I believe what caused this difference was that after coaching, I was projecting myself with confidence and making my presence known!&rdquo; <br/> <br/> I was delighted, and my first thought was, what a great story to illustrate the power of that hard-to-define something we call presence. <br/> <br/> What made the difference for her? There could be many things contributing, as Cary Grant, a former Hollywood leading man, once observed:  &ldquo;It takes 500 small details to add up to one favorable impression.&rdquo;  But I believe the following five items that we discussed were very important.  They gave her more self-confidence and increased her presence, resulting in others taking note of her &ndash; and her clothing &ndash; more favorably:</p><p> 1. <strong>  Good posture. </strong> When you stand tall, you are more apt to be noticed.  It has little to do with how tall you actually are. You can stand tall regardless of your height. <br/> <br/> 2. <strong>  Eye contact. </strong> When you look at people and make eye contact, they are more likely to engage with you. Many of us have a tendency to look away in an uncomfortable situation. By doing this, you are telling the other person that you are nervous. You don&rsquo;t want to do that. Force yourself to look at the person &ndash; though you can occasionally glance away.      <br/> <br/> 3. <strong>  Volume. </strong> You can usually add power to your presence by adding volume. When you speak loudly enough to be heard clearly, people are less likely to ignore your ideas.  Speaking too softly was a big area of concern for the business woman from Jamaica. <br/> <br/> 4. <strong>  Offer your opinion. </strong> If you don&rsquo;t express your opinion in meetings, people don&rsquo;t know what you think. Preparing ahead of time for a meeting can help you to speak up with confidence.  Make sure you speak early in the meeting. The longer you wait to speak, the harder it becomes.  <br/> <br/> 5. <strong>  Confront others. </strong>  Learning to confront others in what I call a &ldquo;polite and powerful&rdquo; manner allows you to speak up, express what&rsquo;s bothering you, and feel good about it. Additional information on conflict can be found in my book, The Power of Positive Confrontation: The Skills You Need to Handle Conflicts at Work, at Home, Online, and In Life.   <br/> <br/> Which of these items do you need to add to your image to help you experience the power of presence?&emsp;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 18:48:36.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 18:48:36.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_FnGXfTH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-you-want-to-be-noticed-the-power-of-presence/\", \"post_id\": \"6329\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 18:48:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 18:48:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-you-want-to-be-noticed-the-power-of-presence\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6328\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2902\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-24-at-11.50.02-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"432\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443204000,"author_id":51,"chart_url":""}

During that process, you&rsquo;re probably going to look at what worked and what didn&rsquo;t, and if you&rsquo;re like many companies we talk to, you&rsquo;re looking to spend more money and time on digital marketing.</p><p> Companies are wising up to the fact that digital marketing should produce measurable business results, and so you may be setting goals for your online marketing for the first time. Good for you!</p><p> We&rsquo;ve talked before about how an overall plan is really important to making sure that the time and money you spend online gets the best possible outcome (check out #1 in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/not-seeing-results-from-inbound-marketing-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this article  </a> </u> ). But what tactics should be included in your plan?</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re doing it in-house or outsourcing your digital marketing, developing an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   online marketing strategy  </a> </u>  is only the first step toward achieving your business goals. Here are 6 marketing activities that are essential for successful small and mid-market digital marketing.</p><h3> Social Media</h3><p> <br/> Although there has been an explosion of social media sites in the last few years (anyone using  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Periscope  </a> </u>  yet?), there are 3 sites that offer a very real benefit to businesses as they develop their marketing strategy. The Big 3 &mdash; Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are powerful platforms from which to launch and spread a message. When you&rsquo;re considering how to spread the word through social media, consider your audiences, and if you&rsquo;re paying for social media advertising, targeted audiences and multiple campaigns offer the greatest benefit.</p><p> <strong>  Pro Tip: </strong> <strong>  Haven&rsquo;t gotten started in social media yet? </strong>  Here&rsquo;s the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/b2b-demand-generation-with-social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   logical argument for using social media marketing  </a> </u> , an article for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/industrial-manufacturing-companies-getting-started-in-social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   getting started  </a> </u> , and we also have compiled a lengthier  <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/ebook-enhance-internet-presence-social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   guide to using social media at your company  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Analytics</h3><p> <br/> Analytics was once an option only available to businesses willing to invest large sums of money in software and people to perform analysis. Today, there&rsquo;s Google Analytics (a popular, free option). But if you&rsquo;re really looking for a wealth of insightful data, you&rsquo;ll need to dig deeper. Look for software that can tie results back to leads and revenue so you know exactly what works.</p><p> <strong>  Pro Tip:  </strong> Don&rsquo;t just scratch the surface.

If you have only a few seconds to capture a potential customer&rsquo;s attention, your primary objective must be to promote a consistent, effective message and voice.</p><p> A voice and brand style guide can be a powerful tool to keep your online marketing strategy consistent, not just for web messaging and content marketing, but also to keep online complimenting your offline efforts.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Don&rsquo;t get caught up in trying to please everyone in your company. Think of your primary audiences first when writing communications from your website content to blogs and emails.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/b2b-brand-message-gap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Read this article for more information on writing for your customers  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Content Creation</h3><p> <br/> Closely related to voice and brand messaging is  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-content-marketing-tools-list?__hstc=268771694.b3fc5611831d1ecfcca72d8aa6dad2b6.1427823328539.1441741034131.1443120699805.14&amp;__hssc=268771694.1.1443120699805&amp;__hsfp=255953479\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content creation  </a> </u> . Content creation is simply the process of actively engaging potential (and existing) clients by providing them with informative, educational and entertaining information.</p><p> Buyers of your services and products expect to find information online that&rsquo;s focused on their needs. In response, marketers are creating more content, which affects quality.</p><p> Cheesy, cliche, and obvious sales pitches are no longer enough. Today&rsquo;s consumers not only want to connect with you for your product or service, but they also want you to provide interesting content.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Creating quality content takes time.

You want to be deliberate in how you publish content on your website, being sure to include words that your prospective customers use as they describe your product or service.</p><p> Search engines tweak their ranking algorithms constantly, and it can be tough to keep up with it all.  <u>  <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Moz  </a> </u>  is a great resource for practical, common sense SEO advice, but don&rsquo;t hesitate to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing/search-engine-optimization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contact a pro  </a> </u>  that can help attract more people to your website.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  It takes much more than simply putting keywords in a page or optimizing meta tags for proper SEO. Here are some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/common-seo-myths/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SEO myths  </a> </u>  you should be aware of.</p><h3> Conversion Rate Optimization</h3><p> <br/> Your company might have been doing search engine optimization and writing content, but the single most underutilized activity when it comes to digital marketing is conversion rate optimization.</p><p> Conversion rate optimization, or CRO, is simply a fancy way to describe the process of testing different things in order to get more business opportunities from the website visitors you already have.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Did you know that you can make smaller, incremental changes to your website in order to get more leads? Because conversion rate optimization involves writing, design and development,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/growth-driven-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   growth driven design  </a> </u>  is a great solution to scientifically design for better results.</p><p> The most successful businesses have learned how to effectively use every tool available in their digital strategy.

{"original_id":2829,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Reasons People Don't Listen To You","link":"6-reasons-people-dont-listen-to-you","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Recently, I was talking to an individual whom I truly like, but we were in a crowded room filled with lots of people I knew. My eye wandered over my friend&rsquo;s shoulder as I mentally prioritized those I needed to contact as soon as our conversation ended. </strong></p><p> My friend tried to catch my eye and drag me back into our conversation. I nodded mechanically while my eye kept sneaking over her shoulder to take in the social patterns developing in the room. </p><p> Eventually, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost you. Let&rsquo;s talk later.&rdquo;</p><p> I felt terrible, but I knew she was right. I was pretending to listen as I recited a mental tally of whom I needed to talk to before the evening ended.</p><p> Situations like this can range from annoying to destructive. According to  <u>  Pamela Cooper </u> , Vice President of the International Listening Association, &ldquo;Listening is really hard work and it takes a great deal of concentration.&rdquo;</p><p> If you want people to listen to you, you must have the mental toughness to be brutally honest with yourself. </p><p> Think about your own listening skills, or better yet, thicken your skin and ask a good friend or your spouse for their honest evaluation. To be a good listener it takes more than just hearing what the person is saying&mdash;it requires a conscious desire, conscientiousness, and practice.</p><p> People don&rsquo;t listen to you because you don&rsquo;t:</p><h3> 1. Stay Engaged</h3><p> <br/> To be a good listener, you have to be present&mdash;which means not being preoccupied either physically or mentally. Dump the clutter from your mind and pay attention to what is being communicated to you now.</p><p> When you are distracted by other people or technology, it makes the other person feel unimportant.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> If you&rsquo;re in a busy room, focus on the person with whom you are talking rather than what is going on around you</li><li> If you&rsquo;re talking on the phone, turn your back on the computer and give the person your full attention</li><li> Stop thinking about arguments, reports to be finished, or where you are going to dinner <br/>  </li><h3> 2. Open Up Your Body Language</h3><p> <br/> Body language communicates what you are thinking and feeling more accurately than the words you use. </p><p> No matter how interested you appear to be, if your feet are turned toward the nearest exit you are signaling that you are anxious to make an escape. Crossing arms or hands in pockets also exhibits nervous behavior. These small physical gestures can discourage others from approaching you.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Lean forward and nod occasionally</li><li> Face the person who is speaking</li><li> Open up your posture by uncrossing the arms</li><li> Make eye contact <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Leave Your Assumptions Behind</h3><p> <br/> If your brain thinks that it knows the answer, it will only accept information that confirms your beliefs. </p><p> Making assumptions and generalizations are hard-wired into our thinking. But, if you can generate genuine interest in the topic, or person, you can over-ride this tendency and create an open mind.</p><p> When listening to another person, it may help to assume you know nothing about what they are telling you.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Check your assumption out loud with the person with whom you are talking</li><li> Ask a question such as, &ldquo;So you mean&hellip;&rdquo; and let the person confirm or correct <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Ask Questions</h3><p> <br/> The two most powerful words in a conversation are: &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p><p> Questions are incredibly important in any conversation. People like to be heard, and when you ask a question, it signals that you are not only listening to them but that you are also hearing what they have to say. </p><p> If you take an genuine interest in the activities of others, they will return the favor.</p><p> Questions allow you to dig deeper and discover more about specific areas on which you are unclear so you can gain a better understanding of a person&rsquo;s priorities, values, and interests. Because of this, it is easier to connect with others and develop meaningful relationships.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Open-ended questions provide great opportunities for people to elaborate on specific topics</li><li> Questions keep conversations flowing</li><li> Asking for clarification helps you understand someone&rsquo;s point of view</li><li> Asking questions of yourself will keep you from becoming defensive <br/>  </li><h3> 5. Create Empathy</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes we don&rsquo;t really want to hear what other people have to say! We love our own opinions and thoughts and would prefer to shut out those of others.</p><p> Once we close down, however, we risk becoming judgmental and opinionated. More importantly, we miss out on what others have to share with us. </p><p> If you can develop the ability to hunt out shared experiences, it is easier to take in the big picture and create empathy.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Suspend judgment&mdash;even if you have firm beliefs on the subject</li><li> Take in the entire message with no interruptions</li><li> Seek out bits of information with which you agree so you can find some shared ground</li><li> Place yourself in the other person&rsquo;s shoes <br/>  </li><h3> 6. Shut Up</h3><p> <br/> There is a time to speak and a time to shut up and listen. Effective communication requires reciprocity. If you aren&rsquo;t a good listener, do not be surprised when others don&rsquo;t make listening to you a top priority.</p><p> <strong>  TIPS: </strong></p><li> Shut up if you don&rsquo;t have something significant to contribute to the conversation</li><li> Shut up if you can&rsquo;t find something positive to say</li><li> Shut up if you don&rsquo;t intend to hold your part of the bargain</li><li> Shut up if your only contribution is to whine and complain <br/>  </li><p> How have you become a more effective listener?</p> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 19:04:15.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 19:04:15.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Y2P4K2D.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-reasons-people-dont-listen-to-you/\", \"post_id\": \"6333\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 19:04:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 19:04:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-reasons-people-dont-listen-to-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6332\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2904\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/woman-girl-technology-music-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"449\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443184200,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

Why do we need to? Five evidence-based practices to kickstart your happiness, starting now.</p><p> I recently had lunch with a friend who never ceases to amaze me. She&rsquo;s an inspiring leader, a caring mom, a savvy professional and an excellent athlete. She&rsquo;s also one of the happiest people I know. I always leave our get-togethers feeling better than when I arrived.</p><p> Her life isn&rsquo;t perfect. She faces overwhelming responsibilities at work, worries about her aging parents, and is navigating some tough issues with her teenagers. She also deals with an uncertain health diagnosis that often saps her energy, bringing in its place pain and fatigue.</p><p> And still, she's one of the happiest people I know.</p><p> Contrary to what some skeptics would have you believe, happiness isn&rsquo;t about ignoring pain or pasting an inauthentic smile on your face no matter what. You can experience the full range of life&rsquo;s emotions &ndash; including grief, fear, and sadness &ndash; and still live a happy existence. As a recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/08/happiness-isnt-the-absence-of-negative-feelings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article in the Harvard Business Review  </a> </u>  suggested, happiness is more about building your mental and emotional strength than about maintaining a constant state of rah-rah.</p><p> And why does happiness matter, really? When I first began my business, I wondered how to educate employers that happiness at work isn&rsquo;t just a nice-to-do; it&rsquo;s a critical component for success. Fortunately, research now abounds in this field (see  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iowabiz.com/2015/08/whats-your-positivity-ratio-and-why-does-it-matter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my column last month  </a> </u> , for example) and brings with it personal and workplace benefits: higher engagement and productivity, lower turnover, greater morale. In all, a healthier bottom line along with a healthier workforce. Check out the work of Martin Seligman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Shawn Achor for starters, as well as the real-world application shared in Tony Hsieh&rsquo;s  Delivering Happiness  and Gretchen Rubin&rsquo;s  The Happiness Project .</p><p> So the big question: How can we elevate happiness in work, leadership, and life? Here are 5 evidence-based principles to kickstart happiness:</p><li> <strong>  Express gratitude. </strong>  Several of my executive coaching clients keep a gratitude journal, jotting down three things they&rsquo;re grateful for each day. This simple strategy not only encourages recognition of the small joys, it shifts your mindset to focus on the positive.</li><li> <strong>  Commit to meaningful goals. </strong> &ldquo;Find a happy person and you will find a project,&rdquo; writes happiness researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky. Striving towards goals engages our strengths, feeds our sense of optimism, and provides a sense of purposeful challenge.</li><li> <strong>  Connect with others. </strong> In addition to cultivating relationships, practice random acts of kindness, too. Give some thought to how you might do this with your coworkers, clients, and others with whom you work &ndash; so fun!</li><li> <strong>  Get into flow. </strong> What activities grip you so much, you lose track of time? However possible, weight your day in favor of your strengths, and help your employees do the same.  </li><li> <strong>  Practice mindful presence. </strong> Over 40 years ago, Ram Dass titled his popular book &ldquo;Be Here Now&rdquo; &ndash; and that advice has only become more necessary over time. Rather than constantly thinking about what&rsquo;s next (or what you&rsquo;re missing), savor the moment.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 19:08:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 19:08:49.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_45y9bpo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/happiness-the-what-why-and-how/\", \"post_id\": \"6335\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 19:08:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 19:08:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"happiness-the-what-why-and-how\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6334\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2905\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sea-man-person-holiday-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"488\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443201300,"author_id":150,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2831,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Getting Your Performance Review Rebuttal Right","link":"getting-your-performance-review-rebuttal-right","source_link":null,"content":"<p> For the most part, people will agree they do their jobs and sail into performance review time with no worries. They go through the performance process and everything they are hearing aligns with their efforts and accomplishments for the year. Great!</p><p> However, what happens when you receive a review that you aren&rsquo;t totally in agreement with? Do you accept the erroneous evaluation or do you craft a rebuttal to defend yourself? The answer is the latter. You craft a performance review rebuttal and defend your performance.</p><p> I find many employees still don&rsquo;t know that they don&rsquo;t have to sign or accept a performance evaluation just because it is given. As an employee, you have a duty to read the contents of your performance evaluation. Equally, you have a duty to decide whether you agree with your manager&rsquo;s evaluation of your work, accomplishments and developments. It&rsquo;s called being an active participant in your career.</p><p> Unfortunately, there is still a practice and sentiment that exists in organizations that managers don&rsquo;t need to tune into everything their employees do. Instead, they stick their heads in the sand most of the time and pop their heads up when there is an issue or something emergent is at stake. That said, no one knows what you do day-to-day better than you. Your second line of defense would be people you work collaboratively with either daily or on a project basis. Keep them in you back pocket always.</p><p> <strong>  So&hellip; How do you properly craft a performance review rebuttal? </strong></p><p> Performance Review Rebuttals are time-sensitive and usually have one window of opportunity. That means you need to make sure your rebuttal is crafted, reviewed and edited for any potential mistakes and handed in shortly after your review takes place. In larger companies, you don&rsquo;t want to be forgotten as your manager moves through the performance review process evaluating your other teammates. Keep your performance conversation fresh by getting this done immediately after your review.</p><p> <strong>  One Window of Opportunity </strong></p><p> You will likely have one opportunity to counter the evaluation. That said, you need to ensure you hit all of the points needed to drive home an objective reason for changing your evaluation. This is not a time to complain or gripe with your manager (even if you feel that way subconsciously).  It is also not a time for gloating or niceties. Your performance evaluation is a serious matter. It can dictate how much you receive in raises, whether you are promoted and let&rsquo;s face it whether you have a job or not. In this rebuttal, your only objective is to address the feedback and illustrate why it is wrong by describing how you impacted the business differently than what the evaluation suggests.</p><p> Some other suggestions on crafting a winning performance review rebuttal are as follows:</p><li> Explicitly outline the items in the performance review that you feel were not aligned with your efforts. Talk about facts not feelings.</li><li> Where possible include dollars and cents to illustrate how your work has had bottom-line impact.</li><li> Request a follow-up meeting to discuss your rebuttal against the evaluation. This will give you a not only state your claim in writing; but verbally too.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-24 19:12:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-24 19:12:52.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_E8Ukmui.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/getting-your-performance-review-rebuttal-right/\", \"post_id\": \"6337\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-24 19:12:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-24 19:12:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"getting-your-performance-review-rebuttal-right\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6336\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2906\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/light-sky-windows-silo-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1007\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443186000,"author_id":212,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2832,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Businesses Don't Fail, People Fail Businesses","link":"businesses-dont-fail-people-fail-businesses","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Watching the reality TV shows  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/restaurant-impossible.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Restaurant Impossible  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.spike.com/shows/bar-rescue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bar Rescue  </a> </u>  has become something of a ritual at my house. My 11 year old is a fan of both shows but slightly favors Jon Taffer&rsquo;s Bar Rescue. I&rsquo;m not sure what originally hooked us into watching other people struggle through the challenges of owning and operating a small business. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we relate to the experiences of the small business owners or that the hosts of both shows employ a &ldquo;no holds barred&rdquo; approach that&rsquo;s provocative and makes for good TV. Is there something to be learned by business leaders from watching shows like Restaurant Impossible, Bar Rescue, and the like? If you&rsquo;ve been around awhile, perhaps not anything new but it does remind us of the importance of a fundamental truth in business: <strong>   businesses don&rsquo;t fail, people fail businesses. </strong></p><p> Shows like these share a common plot line. The story begins with a once successful business that has fallen on hard times. The owner is generally in self-denial and blames outside forces for his bad luck and has accumulated a mountain of debt hoping that business will someday improve. Time passes but nothing changes for the better. Hopelessness then apathy set in. The business falls into disrepair, it can&rsquo;t attract or retain competent staff, and the quality of its products and services fall well below acceptable. To add insult to injury, patrons who are active in social media have taken to merciless disparagement. In a final and desperate attempt to save the business, an expert is called in to rescue it from imminent demise.</p><p> The expert (Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible or Jon Taffer from Bar Rescue) shows up and quickly identifies the key issues. Working closely with the owner, they are able to turn things around in a matter of days. How are they able to turn around a business that has taken months if not years to decline to the point of imminent failure and turn it around in a matter of days? Where do they start? The team, of course. In a typical episode, the expert begins by convincing the owner that his business will never succeed if he continues to employ people who lack the necessary skills to perform their job, lack the necessary commitment to the business&rsquo; success, or both. Those that can&rsquo;t or refuse to change their ways or who aren&rsquo;t trainable are fired immediately (see  <u>  Harpooning the Sharks </u>  for further insights).

It&rsquo;s not the first thing in the process (that would be learn), it&rsquo;s not the prototype and it&rsquo;s not a mini-version of the final product.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a product for testing your hypothesis.</p><p> There&rsquo;s some arguing within the lean camp about what constitutes an MVP. Some say it can be anything &mdash; even a  <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joelgascoigne/how-to-successfully-validate-your-idea-with-a-landing-page-mvp-ef3c2d02dc51\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   landing page  </a> </u> . Others say, hell no! it&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://leanstack.com/minimum-viable-product/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   gotta be a product  </a> </u> . We shrug our shoulders. It&rsquo;s arguing over semantics, because Steve Blanks says every <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   hypothesis needs its own MVP  </u> </a> .</p><p> It&rsquo;s that first MVP that gets ya. That&rsquo;s the one that has the power to grow or utterly crush any hypothesis. Which &mdash; let&rsquo;s be honest &mdash; is a little intimidating. The good news is that once the MVP is built, your learning amps up tremendously and things begin to look a wee bit clearer.</p><p> Some lean entrepreneurs will tell you that your first MVP should tackle a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.panozzaj.com/blog/2012/01/11/signs-you-arent-really-building-a-minimum-viable-product/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   risky assumption  </a> </u> . In fact, they advise, try to make the MVP fail (&ldquo;fail fast, fail often&rdquo;). This way you minimize waste and if it succeeds, you&rsquo;ve passed a major hurdle. Others will tell you that your first MVP needs a  <u>  <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2015/08/03/minimum-viable-product-mvp-test\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   killer feature  </a> </u>  or it ain&rsquo;t jack. Both suggestions are good, but again, semantics.</p><p> The lean process never endorses  <strong>  failing for failure&rsquo;s sake </strong> . It&rsquo;s all about validated learning. The only caveat would be that if you are destined to fail, despite working smart, then failure in 3 months is better than 3 years. As for killer features, lean is agnostic to coolness andtechnology. If it takes adding X,Y, Z features to your product in order to test a hypothesis, then that&rsquo;s what it takes. But if you discover that you can test the same hypothesis with an  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fatbraintoys.com/toy_companies/ohio_art/classic_etch_a_sketch.cfm?source=google_pla&amp;kwid=OA001&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=Product_Target&amp;utm_campaign=SHOPPING&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=exSTv21c%7Cpcrid%7C51465719530%7Cpkw%7C%7Cpmt%7C%7Cpdv%7Cc%7C&amp;gclid=CITB6sC--scCFY9ufgod6-UL2A\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   etch-a-sketch  </a> </u> , do that. Killer featured be damned.</p><p> Working beyond what&rsquo;s required to start learning is a big fat  <u>  <a href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/book\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   waste  </a> </u>  of time!</p><p> Your first MVP is a reflection of how well you&rsquo;ve understood the customer&rsquo;s problem. To avoid waste,  hold off building until you can answer these questions:</p><p> <strong>  What am I testing? </strong>  &mdash; that is, what&rsquo;s my hypothesis? Ideally, for your first MVP, the hypothesis should fit into a single question (e.g., &ldquo;Would insurance companies pay us to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.zenefits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   manage  </a> </u>  their benefits?&rdquo;). The answer to your hypothesis should be simple as well (e.g., yes/no, black/white, up/down).</p><p> You might find Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;trick&rdquo; for product development helpful for framing your hypothesis. Here&rsquo;s how it works. The product manager writes a mock  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   press release  </a> </u>  about whatever cool new idea the team decides on. He or she will then iterate on paper until the benefits of this new product are succinct and exciting. The mock-up is then tested with real customers to gauge their reactions.</p><p> Now, if you&rsquo;ve read more than a few corporate press releases, you know how utterly forgettable most of them are. They suck! But if you do like Amazon does with press releases (write an awesome grabber headline, addressed to the market you&rsquo;ve researched, and fill the body with benefits), you&rsquo;ll come up with a lot of cool features from which to work backwards. The end of the road is the first hypothesis you test.</p><p> <strong>  How will I measure it?  </strong> &mdash; that is, which metric you use. If your customers use your product as expected, this shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to figure out. To minimize the risk of user malfunction with your first MVP, ask yourself these  <u>  <a href=\"http://leananalyticsbook.com/one-metric-that-matters/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   three questions  </a> </u> :</p><p> What business am I in?</p><p> What stage am I in?</p><p> Who is my customer?</p><p> Of course, in the startup world, stuff happens, and your customers might do things with your product that you never accounted for. Don&rsquo;t kick yourself&hellip; it&rsquo;s all good if you learn something from it.</p><p> <strong>  What will determine success? </strong>  &mdash; speed is a major component in lean methodology. You want to run through the learn-build-measure loop as often as possible until you&rsquo;ve achieved product market fit.</p><p> So, with your first MVP, you&rsquo;ve gotta draw a line in the sand. Once you&rsquo;ve answered your hypothesis with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or other affirmation, move on to the next test. Time is money and you either make it to product market fit or you die on the vine.</p><p> <strong>  What will determine failure? </strong>  &mdash; sometimes even entrepreneurs with steel backbones and the drive of a horse crumble in the face of a failed hypothesis.  &rdquo;Let&rsquo;s just give it more time.&rdquo; &ldquo;We need a bigger sample size.&rdquo; &ldquo;We need to market it better.&rdquo;</p><p> If your product has any chance for success, you&rsquo;ve gotta be ready to accept failure. Dust yourself off and move on to the next hypothesis.</p><p> <strong>  Can I explain my user stories in one sentence? </strong>  &mdash; if you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll be tempted to build too much. That makes a lot of MVPs &hellip; umm, not viable. The structure for a user story goes, &ldquo;As a &lt;user type&gt;, I want to &lt;action&gt; so that I can &lt;achieve this result&gt;.</p><p> If you find it hard to put user stories into simple sentences, try creating a  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.cayenneapps.com/2014/11/25/5-steps-to-building-minimum-viable-product-with-story-mapping/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   story map  </a> </u> . You can generate one by defining your goal for the product and the steps needed to achieve the goal. You add features for every step in the workflow. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, prioritize the features. Slice off the top layer of the map (the workflow runs left to right), and shazam! there&rsquo;s your MVP.</p><p> <strong>  Can I explain what I know about a market or problem in one sentence?  </strong> &mdash; this is a problem for entrepreneurs with expert knowledge of the market they&rsquo;re working in. They might be tempted to build too much in that first MVP because they think everyone else in their market is exactly like them. The key to avoiding overbuilding is clarity. If you know your $h*!, then you should be able to explain in child&rsquo;s terms what problem your MVP is solving for.</p><p> <strong>  Would someone pay for this? </strong> &ndash; In this age of companies with no revenue stream or profit valued in the gazillions, asking yourself whether someone would pay for your MVP probably sounds like an irrelevant question. &ldquo;Who cares if they won&rsquo;t gimme money for it now, they WILL in the future.&rdquo;</p><p> But this type of thinking goes against the &ldquo;V&rdquo; in MVP. Your first product is supposed to viable from a business perspective. Which, funny enough, seems to answer the previous argument about the MVP definition (i.e., would anybody pay for a landing page?), but I won&rsquo;t go there. I don&rsquo;t wanna get my ass kicked by any Buffer groupies.</p><p> Anyway, Steve Blank (what, him again?) said a startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a  <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   repeatable and scalable business model  </u>  . </a>  I don&rsquo;t want to mention any names ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-ceo-admits-were-still-in-the-red-2013-7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Reddit  </a> </u> ), but if you&rsquo;re not thinking soberly about market with that first MVP, you might never get it right.</p><p> So working through the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business model canvas  </a> </u>  with  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI3yXg-sX5c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   money on your mind  </a> </u>  is a great way to choose your first hypothesis/MVP:</p><li> <p>  value proposition </p></li><li> <p>  customer segments </p></li><li> <p>  distribution channels </p></li><li> <p>  customer relationships </p></li><li> <p>  revenue streams </p></li><li> <p>  activities </p></li><li> <p>  resources </p></li><li> <p>  partners </p></li><li> <p>  cost structure  <br/>    </p></li><p> Look, startups are confused places. Nobody can tell you what your first MVP should be precisely because they don&rsquo;t know what you know. That&rsquo;s why you should be wary about &ldquo;hacks,&rdquo; best practices, and origin stories. Even if everything you read about other companies is true &mdash; and not exaggerated for drama&rsquo;s sake &mdash; your situation is at least slightly different.</p><p> Suppose while building your MVP that you&rsquo;ve discovered that you&rsquo;re not really a startup? You&rsquo;re actually a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; business for which there&rsquo;s already an existing market and solution. It happens. Does that mean you&rsquo;ve failed? Should you be upset about the wasted time, effort, and money?</p><p> Uh uh. You should celebrate! It shows that you really DID learn, discover and think through the problems starting from your customer&rsquo;s vantage point.

{"original_id":2834,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Your College Campus Safe?","link":"is-your-college-campus-safe","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvadmaven\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jan Edwards  </u> </a> | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pavingtheway.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Paving the Way  </a> </u> It's called the \"rape\" culture. An environment that 'call's for rape. College parties, girls in pretty dresses, lots of alcohol. All a recipe for possible disaster. <strong>  According to a new report released earlier this week by the Association of American Universities, 1 in 4 women say they are sexually assaulted before they graduate; </strong> this based on responses from 150,000 students at 27 top universities polled last spring. ( Sexual assault is defined as any involuntary sexual act in which a person is coerced, or physically forced to engage, against their will)This number was so staggering the White house created a task force to investigate and to see what can be done. What they discovered was even worse.Their first report, called \" <u>  <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/report_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Not Alone,  </a> </u> \" discovered that 3 out of 4 women sexually assaulted are lower class-men, freshman or sophomores, and 84 percent of the time the perpetrator is another student. In the majority of cases, the victim knows her attacker, whether as an acquaintance, classmate, friend or (ex)-boyfriend.</p><h3> All this to say, daughter beware. Son's be gentlemen.</h3>Rape is not cool nor a way to get what you want. It damages the soul of a precious human being. It's not a game or prize to be won.Moms and Dad's prepare your children for the signs of possible collusion that lead to forced sex. It's starts very innocently - a flirty smile here, a wink there and the next thing you know, this handsome young man is standing next to you, talking, asking you all about you. Innocently, he offers to get you a drink and the next thing you know, you wake up in a strange place, possibly half clothed with a massive headache and afraid, 'wondering what the heck happened?'It's embarrassing - I should know. It happened to me. The interesting thing is I didn't discover it until 30 years later having a conversation with my daughter.We were discussing dating, college and the prevalence of date rape, and it hit me. It happened to me - started out innocently. We went out, had a few drinks...had a few more drinks, went back to my place. Willingly we engaged in sex....the next morning, I was woken up with him having his way with me...all while I'm asleep!I was shocked at first - then realized what was happening. By the time I did, his full body weight was on me and there was no where for me to go. Nothing for me to do. In that moment, I was helpless.Now, one could argue, we were intimate the night before, it was 'his right' or he thought I'd 'enjoy' waking up like that....valid and very inaccurate. He didn't wake me up with gentle kisses and whisper sweet nothings in my ear. Nope - he did what he wanted, whether I wanted it or not. That is sexual assault.It was embarrassing and I never said anything. Who would believe me anyway. We went home together the night before. No way to prove anything. And it was buried so far down, that it took a conversation with my daughter to provoke the thought some 30 years later.I share this as an example of the data that has been provided. It's real and happens far more than most girls would like to admit. They'd be seen as lose, or worse. So they keep their mouth shut and live with the guilt and shame. Thinking somehow they are to blame.You are not to blame. No one has the right to force themselves on you. Regardless if you were intimate the night before. There was no consent - that, is sexual assault or rape.<h3> Here are some tips to keep you safe on Campus and out in the world of bars and parties:</h3><strong> 1. Travel in pairs or more.</strong>Never leave your wing-woman alone to fend for herself.<strong> 2. Get your own drinks.</strong>Better yet, BYOB when you can - then you have control.<strong> 2a - Beware in bars as well.</strong>Bartenders can be in on this too. Have them open the beer or pour the drink in front of you. Never take a drink from a stranger or leave your drink unattended.<strong> 3. Have a designated 'driver' - and I'm not talking about a car.</strong>It's someone in your group who commits to staying sober and alert to ensure none of her friends are taken advantage of that night.<strong> 4. Take a cab or Uber or mass transit to and from parties.</strong>You got there on your own, no need to get a ride from a stranger.<strong> 5. Carry a pen, maze, whistle or some other protection in your purse. </strong><strong> A note to men</strong>- We get it. You like sex. Great. Here's the thing, when a woman says no, she really means it. There is no scenario where a man forcing himself upon a woman is it ok. We don't like it. It hurts and is shameful. It's not ok. Educate yourself on what constitutes rape or assault. Take part in the #StandUpGuy campaign. You'll be glad you did.<strong> Lastly</strong>- call home  to let your parents know you are ok. Call before you go to a big party and when you get home safe. If not your parents, your girlfriends. Trafficking happens at these parties too.

{"original_id":2835,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Stay Organized and Efficient!","link":"how-to-stay-organized-and-efficient","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  How are you at organizing your day?  </strong> Do you find that the &ldquo;small things&rdquo; like organizing your office, organizing your laptop, checking in with old customers just to see how they&rsquo;re doing, distract you from what you know you need to be doing to make more money &ndash; i.e., cold call, follow up on leads, call prospects back who are on the fence, etc.?  </p><p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re like most inside sales reps, then there are many distractions which seem to scream out for your time and attention.  </strong> There&rsquo;s checking and responding to emails, organizing your calling campaign and leads, keeping your leads and notes together and up to date in Salesforce, calling on existing customers to follow up on sales, there&rsquo;s meetings, social network research, etc. And on top of all that, when it&rsquo;s finally time to prospect for new business, there&rsquo;s that dang organizing again!</p><p> And on top of all of that (or perhaps at the bottom of it all), there&rsquo;s the real dread of making those outbound prospecting calls, you know, call reluctance. </p><h3> So what are you going to do? </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  You&rsquo;re going to use the proven time management technique known as &ldquo;The Top Three Priorities.&rdquo;  </strong> Here&rsquo;s how it works: </p><p> First, before you go home for the day, make a list and identify the three most important things you need to do the next day to accomplish your most important goal: Making sales. These things might be:</p><p> <strong>  1. Call the hottest prospects in your pipeline &ndash; those most likely to buy that day. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2 .Make a definite number of cold calls to keep your pipeline full. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3 .Follow up with recent orders to upsell them. </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. Reach a certain number of existing clients to look for upsell opportunities. </strong></p><p> <strong>  5. Put together proposals or quotes. </strong></p><p> <strong>  6. Follow up on proposals or quotes. </strong></p><p> <strong>  7. Check in with prospects or leads in your pipeline </strong></p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve picked out the THREE most important things that you can do the next day, again, the three most important things that are going to lead to sales that day, then write these down in order of importance and leave them on your desk for the next morning&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  By the way, making this list the night before is crucial as it allows your subconscious mind to begin to devise ways of accomplishing them for you.  </strong> Whether you know it or believe it or not, what you write down and intend to do sends a powerful message to your subconscious mind, and it will work hard during the evening and night, preparing you to accomplish your goals the next day.</p><p> Now here&rsquo;s the key to the whole process of identifying your &ldquo;Top Three Priorities&rdquo;: when you get in the next day, start working on one priority at a time and work it through to completion before you move on to the next one.  In other words, resist the temptation to multi-task these three items.  As you know, if you begin doing too many things at once, you end up not completing any of them. </p><p> The key to this powerful time-management technique is to pick out the most important priority you&rsquo;ve identified, then complete it and then move on the next one, complete that one, and then move on to the next one and complete that as well.  If something comes up &ndash; like an inbound customer call, or an urgent email you need to address &ndash; then certainly handle that, but then get back to the priority you are working on. </p><p> While I know that many other things will vie for your attention, and some of them might even need to be done, sticking with and accomplishing your &ldquo;Three Top Priorities&rdquo; will not only make you ultra-efficient, but it will relieve a lot of anxiety for you as well.  Let me give you a brief example:</p><p> Years ago when I decided to become a full time consultant, I had a lot or work to do on my business.  I had to create the website, write all the copy for the pages, create downloadable ebooks for my initial product, find hosting sites, shopping carts, write ezines and create opt in pages and links, deal with my webmaster several times a day, proof all the pages endlessly, and much, much more.  While all these projects were crucial for me to begin my consulting practice (and I enjoyed doing them), what I found after a while was that I had stopped doing the things that brought me the capital (money) I needed to pay my mortgage and my webmaster, etc..  In other words, I had stopped cold calling and selling.</p><p> The solution to this was to create my &ldquo;Top Three Priorities&rdquo; and make sure that I worked through them, one by one, before I responded to my webmaster, before I began proofing pages or writing copy, before I created another web page, etc&hellip; </p><p> I started by making 35 cold calls each day.  I took all the time I needed to make these calls, and only when I was done did I then follow up with any leads I had (priority number two).  When I finished that, then I moved on to my next priority &ndash; which was to call five people in my network to prospect for work or to get other leads from.  Only after I completed all three of these priorities did I dive into my work on the business.  And what I found reinforced the importance and effectiveness of this time management technique.</p><p> <strong>  The first benefit </strong> was that as I took care of the important and difficult things &ndash; like cold calling &ndash; I felt a great relief because a big pressure was lifted from me.  Second, as I completed the next priority, I gained confidence and hope as I scheduled meetings and moved closer to closing deals.  Finally, as I worked through the last priority, I felt a tremendous sense of freedom and accomplishment because I knew that the things that would have nagged at me all day were finally complete.  I was now free to handle the other important things guilt free!</p><p> <strong>  Another benefit </strong> started showing up as well: I started closing deals and making money.  As the saying goes: &ldquo;Sales solves everything,&rdquo; and it did indeed make all the work on the business and website so much easier.  As I continued to set three priorities and complete them one by one each day, I made significant progress both on my career and on my website.  And the rest, as they say, is history. </p><p> But it all started by setting and working through each of my three priorities, one by one, before I moved on to all the other important things in my day.  <strong>  If you&rsquo;re struggling to take back control of your day, then pull out a piece of paper and start writing down your &ldquo;Top Three Priorities&rdquo; right now.  </strong> Remember to organize them around your most important goal for each day: making sales.  This one technique is the most important time management strategy I&rsquo;ve learned, and I guarantee that once you begin using it, you, too, will feel more confident, become more efficient and make more sales.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-26 14:25:54.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-26 14:25:54.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_DTssa52.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-stay-organized-and-efficient/\", \"post_id\": \"6345\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-26 14:25:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-26 14:25:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-stay-organized-and-efficient\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6344\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2910\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443175679639-685643a7fd62-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"466\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443448800,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2836,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Challenges of Socially Responsible Investing","link":"the-challenges-of-socially-responsible-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Balancing profits, people, and the planet can be tricky. </strong> Many investors prefer to put their funds into companies that not only make money, but that also reflect the investors' values. Some take this concept, often described as \"socially conscious\" or \"socially responsible\" investing, very seriously. There are also financial advisors who specialize in this niche.</p><h3> Yet investing in companies whose values align with your own is not as simple as it may seem.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  In my experience with business owners and corporate executives, most of them take an interest in bettering the people who work with them, the planet, and their own lives. </strong> They run their companies with integrity. They don&rsquo;t break the law. They respect their customers and don&rsquo;t take advantage of them, but give them fair value in exchange for their money. They offer compensation and working conditions that will attract and retain good employees. Ultimately, they understand that ethical business practices are not only the right thing to do, but the best way to run profitable businesses.</p><p> <strong>  But how do you as an investor know whether a company is bettering people and the planet while it is making a profit? </strong> One method is to choose companies in which to invest by using some type of socially responsible screening. Such screening looks to exclude companies producing products that harm people or the earth, or companies judged to have poor corporate cultures.</p><p> <strong>  One challenge with using such screens is that we don't all have the same definitions of what may be socially or morally offensive. </strong> Investor A may not want to own stock in oil or mining companies. Investor B may be concerned about goods produced in unsafe working conditions. Investor C may not want to support companies that sell tobacco or alcohol.</p><p> <strong>  A second challenge is that companies change. </strong> They may expand, diversify, or merge with other companies until it's difficult to pinpoint their values, products, and company culture. A company may sell a lot of great products that do a lot of good for people, but have one division that produces a product some investors may find offensive. And it's even harder to screen for companies that have good cultures&mdash;especially since there's no clear definition of a \"good\" culture. </p><p> Investors can choose mutual funds that include only socially responsible companies, but any such fund is almost guaranteed to include companies that you would otherwise exclude.</p><p> If you are serious about investing only in <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2013/04/24/socially-responsible-investing-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">   companies that support your values  </a> </u> , it's essential to research them before you invest and monitor them regularly to ensure their practices or products don't change. You also may find it necessary to give companies or SRI funds a little leeway&mdash;settling for perhaps 95% compliance with your values rather than insisting on 100%.</p><p> <strong>  But sadly, even if you could invest your money in the shares of companies that totally support your values, doing so may not have much impact on that company, its people, or the planet. </strong> One reason for this is that your investment is likely to be a miniscule fraction of the company's stock.</p><p> In addition, most often when we invest in stocks, we do not buy shares directly from the company. We buy shares, through a stock exchange, that are being sold by other investors. The profits or losses involved in trading those stocks accrue to the third-party buyers and sellers.</p><h3> They don't directly affect the company's bottom line.</h3><p> <br/> For most small investors, making a difference through socially responsible investing may be an illusory goal. <strong>  Its only real impact may be to help us feel better about ourselves. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-26 14:44:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-26 14:44:14.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_kwZuQbA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-challenges-of-socially-responsible-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"6347\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-26 14:44:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-26 14:44:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-challenges-of-socially-responsible-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6346\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2911\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443078455502-1db413a160de.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"538\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443439800,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

The answer to this is finally&hellip;almost. If that sounds like an unfulfilling answer, it&rsquo;s a heck of a lot further than we&rsquo;ve gotten before.</p><p> Remember &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel\" target=\"_blank\">   death panels  </a> </u> ?&rdquo; When the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) was discussed in 2009, there was an attempt to include end-of-life conversations as part of the coverage. Death panels were the unfortunate name given to made-up insurance, hospital, and doctor panels that were expected to withhold medical care from older American under the affordable care act.</p><p> <strong>  Was it a political ploy by those that opposed the Affordable Care Act? </strong> Sure. But did it tap into a very real concern about the health and wellbeing of older Americans? Absolutely. As a result, including end-of-life conversations as part of the Affordable Care Act and Medicare in general got put on the back burner.</p><p> The thing is, older Americans continue to consume large volumes of healthcare. In fact, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thirteen.org/bid/sb-howmuch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent report  </a> </u>  showed that 40% of all Medicare expenses cover care for people in the last month of their life, and 10% of Medicare patients represent 70% of all Medicare spending. What this really means: older Americans are spending a lot of money on end-of-life care.</p><p> This trend is not about to end any time soon. A recent report by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/total-medicare-beneficiaries/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kaiser Family Foundation  </a> </u>  found that nearly 50 million Americans are on Medicare. So those stats we just mentioned are only going to get worse as Boomers continue to age.</p><p> It&rsquo;s under this umbrella that Medicare is stepping up to the plate and talking about compensating doctors for having end-of-life conversations. Doctors would be paid for the time they spend discussing  <u>  living wills </u> ,  <u>  healthcare proxies </u> ,  <u>  POLST forms </u> ,  <u>  palliative </u>  and  <u>  hospice care </u> , and of course how patients want to spend the last days of their lives. It in no way impacts which decisions patients have to make. It merely gives patients the time to speak with their doctors about what options are out there. <strong>  In a nutshell, it lets patients actually learn what options they have.  </strong></p><p> In a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/medicare-may-pay-doctors-for-end-of-life-talks-119861\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent interview  </a> </u>  J. Donald Schumacher, president of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, noted, &ldquo;Patients deserve assistance with advance care planning and it&rsquo;s essential that these conversations take place before a crisis happens. We are pleased that [Medicare] recognizes the value of these meaningful discussions between physicians and their patients.&rdquo;</p><h3> There is still a hitch. </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Exactly what types of conversations will be covered is still undefined. </strong> There also hasn&rsquo;t been any mention of how much doctors will be compensated for these conversations versus other procedures they must perform. A final proposal is expected by November.</p><p> In spite of this uncertainty, this is a win. When doctors can be paid for having these conversations it makes it much more likely they will happen. And when these conversations happen patients and their families will have better peace of mind during those difficult end-of-life decisions.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-26 14:58:31.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-26 14:58:31.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_7aSI23f.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/just-in-insurance-will-cover-end-of-life-conversations/\", \"post_id\": \"6349\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-26 14:58:31\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-26 14:58:31\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"just-in-insurance-will-cover-end-of-life-conversations\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6348\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2912\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443068493411-0fa75e5a8b10-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"721\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443460500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Correct grammar and context are critical in social media posts, blog content and email marketing messages. Connecting with your audience through the content is one of your main goals and if you don&rsquo;t have someone who can do that, you can be in trouble.</p><p> <strong>  Here are 7 questions you can ask as you explore different social marketing solutions, to ensure they will be able to create content with your brand&rsquo;s unique voice: </strong></p><li> Where is your team located?</li><li> How do you source localized content for our blog, pages, and profiles?</li><li> How often do we get to meet with you?</li><li> How do you ensure the content matches our company culture and voice?</li><li> What kind of content will you be writing for our company?</li><li> Do you need us to provide the content or do you create it?</li><li> Where will you get photos that are used in the content?</li><p> <br/> <strong>  When we begin working with a client that is not in the same city as one of our offices, we ask for lists of local businesses, vendors, partners and local media outlets to get started. </strong> We connect with, subscribe to, and follow community centers, chamber pages, business journals, news and media outlets, and more. We often know about upcoming community events before our clients do! (We try not to gloat but we do love when that happens!)</p><p> As for developing and matching the tone of the brand or business, we spend time speaking with the people who work there. Just like any new hire, we write down the lingo, the forbidden word list, and the vibe we pick up when speaking to everyone. Do people say words like, &ldquo;AWESOME and DUDE?&rdquo; or are we hearing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to speak with you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Jones is on vacation.&rdquo; We have a client who uses emojis in almost everything and calls people, &ldquo;Darling.&rdquo; These are all cues we pick up on and weave into the written content where appropriate&hellip;DUDE!</p><p> <strong>  Photos and fonts are also part of the equation. </strong> Photos evoke emotions and even fonts play into describing your brand&rsquo;s image. It&rsquo;s important that the team you have working on your marketing understand that emotions and messaging must all match the story your brand is trying to create. This might be an area that I tend to &ldquo;advise&rdquo; a little more with our clients. (Crappy images are one of my pet peeves) In our business we see a lot of visual content; good and bad. Photos, videos and graphics are huge influencers in social marketing, and too many people just don&rsquo;t understand how horrifying some of their images are and the damage they are doing to their brand. (See,  <a href=\"http://www.socialknx.com/images-for-social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;Quit using these crappy images&rdquo; </a> )</p><p> <strong>  When a client wants us to use stale corporate images </strong> that you would find on every other stale website (the perfectly diverse team all giving high-fives in the conference room) <strong>  I have to offer my two-cents. </strong></p><h3> These images repel not attract. They say &ldquo;old and irrelevant&rdquo; not innovative and shareable.</h3><p> <br/> So whether you are hiring a part-time person to work in your office or you are considering outsourcing to a digital marketing agency, keep these pointers in mind and let them guide your conversations in the beginning as you all get to know each other.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-26 15:11:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-26 15:11:32.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_MiyV9mw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/can-an-outsourced-agency-write-content-and-sound-like-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"6351\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-26 15:11:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-26 15:11:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"can-an-outsourced-agency-write-content-and-sound-like-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6350\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2913\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-26-at-8.14.13-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"344\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443443400,"author_id":185,"chart_url":""}

Do you have a relationship with the next generation of your current client base? Will you be part of this statistic? Or will you be the one to break it? Our hope for you is the latter!</p><p> The truth is we all know that conversations about money with family can be very difficult. Whether it&rsquo;s with elderly parents, adult children, young children or grandchildren the conversations are tough and in some families are completely taboo.</p><p> Further research shows us that fifty-five percent of adult children feel they haven&rsquo;t had adequate conversations with their boomer parents about their financial situation.&sup2;</p><p> How can you help your clients facilitate these conversations with greater ease? Our suggestion is by becoming an &ldquo;Intimate Advisor.&rdquo;</p><h3> Are You an Intimate Advisor?</h3><p> <br/> Building &ldquo;emotional intimacy&rdquo; is truly a simple, yet powerful concept. Intimacy creates a genuine connection with your clients, which ignites greater productivity and deeper relationships. Becoming an Intimate Advisor ultimately will help you move your client relationships from merely satisfied, to loyal, multi-generational relationships.</p><p> The word intimate comes from the Latin word &ldquo;intima,&rdquo; signifying the deepest, most internal part of something. To be intimate with another is to be open and uncover ones&rsquo; most inner thoughts. This is exactly what is needed from you and with your best clients to create the mutual intimacy that leads to life-long relationships.</p><p> That is what is at stake! Do you believe that if you could create that openness with your clients you would have a tremendously better relationship with them?</p><h3> Introduce Meaningful Legacy Conversations</h3><p> <br/> A unique and profound way of building emotional intimacy with your clients is by introducing meaningful legacy conversations.</p><p> The statistics cited earlier indicate that conversations among the generations, especially about finances, can be a struggle. We believe that discussions with family may be easier when incorporating conversations around family values and core beliefs&mdash;in other words, the intangibles.</p><p> You, as the trusted, intimate financial advisor, can be the one to introduce meaningful legacy conversations to your clients and their families</p><p> Women typically are the natural matriarch to introduce these legacy conversations. Matter of fact, women are more likely than men to initiate financial conversations with their families in general.</p><h3> Getting Started</h3><p> <br/> Our age and number of life experiences may vary, but remind your clients that every family member has a voice and can contribute wisdom.</p><p> A great way to get started introducing legacy conversations is to encourage your clients to arrange a family meal or meeting. Holidays in particular are ideal times for storytelling, talking about family traditions, culture, etc.</p><p> The sad truth is that rarely do we set aside time to talk about what really matters. The concept of meaningful legacy conversations can build bridges across both past and future generations.</p><p> <strong>  The following are a few questions you can use with your clients to help them to get started having legacy conversations: </strong></p><li> How do you define legacy?</li><li> What would you like to add to your family&rsquo;s legacy?</li><li> What family tradition is most important to you and why?</li><li> Who do you admire most in your family and why?</li><li> What philanthropy is most important to your family and why?</li><li> Who taught you the most about money and why? <br/>  </li><h3> Benefits to Your Business</h3><p> <br/> Becoming an Intimate Advisor and introducing legacy conversations will benefit you business in many ways. First and foremost, it will strengthen your tie to multiple generations in a noble and profound way by changing the client experience.</p><p> Your clients will be grateful and loyal to you for life for the legacy you&rsquo;ve helped them to pass on. Other advisors are not doing this, that&rsquo;s why only two percent of children are keeping their parents&rsquo; advisor when their parents pass on! This concept will truly set you apart from your competitors, ultimately providing you more referrals.</p><p> You will only see these benefits, however, if you take action. Take the time right now to write it down and make it happen. In the space provided below, write down the names of three to five clients that you can introduce legacy conversations to in the next 30 days.</p><p> 1.</p><p> 2.</p><p> 3.</p><p> 4.</p><p> 5.</p><p> Sources:</p>&sup1;&ldquo;Engaging and Retaining Families,&rdquo; Investments &amp; Wealth Monitor (IMCA, September/October 2011)<br/>&sup2;Money Across Generations II study, Ameriprise Financial, 2012 ","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-27 14:58:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-27 14:58:58.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_kytqrbw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/building-life-long-multi-generational-clients-through-meaningful-legacy-conversations/\", \"post_id\": \"6357\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-27 14:58:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-27 14:58:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"building-life-long-multi-generational-clients-through-meaningful-legacy-conversations\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6356\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2916\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_2983.JPG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"891\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/06/how-to-master-the-changing-advisor-client-relationship/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443441600,"author_id":490,"chart_url":""}

Some sell products, others sells services. And some of us have to sell our ideas in order to convince our leaders and team members that our way is the right path.</p><p> Online social networks can be exceptionally powerful tools for us as sellers &ndash; IF we know to use them effectively.</p><h3> How not to sell online</h3><p> <br/> Has this happened to you?</p><p> A stranger requests a LinkedIn connection and you accept, only to have that stranger pitch you for something you don&rsquo;t need.</p><p> A Twitter user randomly mentions you in a Tweet in order to get you to click on a link to their product or service.</p><p> You receive an email from a stranger offering you services that you don&rsquo;t need.</p><p> This is how not to sell online. The seller has taken no time to understand you or your needs, so the offer is not relevant. This approach does nothing to build trust. It is a classic old-school selling approach applied in the social networking environment and it makes no sense for most sellers.</p><p> When sellers approach me this way online, I disconnect, unfollow and even block or report them for spam.</p><h3> Social selling means more networking and less marketing</h3><p> <br/> Social selling is a different approach to being a seller online. It is about being contextually relevant to the buyer and building trust. It is about attracting interest and leveraging relationships to sell people things they actually want and need.</p><p> Social selling combines the best practices of traditional networking with skillful use of social media. Think of social selling as how you would behave in a networking situation and then act that way online. Typically, you don&rsquo;t meet people in person for the first time and ask for their business immediately. Successful relationship sellers learn how to build relationships, cultivate trust, and uncover pain points before pitching any solutions.</p><p> <img alt=\"trad-selling-vs-social-selling\" src=\"http://jaypalter.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/trad-selling-vs-social-selling.png\"/></p><p> <strong>  Here are 7 tips for practicing the fine art of social selling: </strong></p><h3> 1. Be interested</h3><p> Spend 10-15 mins/day on LinkedIn and Twitter paying attention to people in your network. People are more apt to pay attention to you when you pay attention to them. Invest your attention in your network and people will respond in kind.</p><h3> 2. Be interesting</h3><p> Find great content to share regularly. Focus on what people in your network will find interesting &ndash; not what you want to sell. If you are consistently interesting, you will win people&rsquo;s attention and respect.</p><h3> 3. Be visible</h3><p> Share frequently on LinkedIn (3x/day), Twitter (5-10x/day), Facebook and Google+. Even if people don&rsquo;t ready most of your shared content, you will be visible and top of mind.</p><h3> 4. Be creative</h3><p> Write. Transcribe your vision into words. Articulate how you see the world. This will serve as a stand-in when you can&rsquo;t meet with someone or have a conversation. Plus, it will help you clarify what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p><h3> 5. Be everywhere</h3><p> Publish on your blog. Guest post on other people&rsquo;s blogs. Write opinion pieces and columns for media and trade publication sites. Publish on LinkedIn.</p><h3> 6. Be smart</h3><p> Analyze your social data &ndash; the likes, shares, and web traffic coming from your content. Know what is driving traffic and engagement and focus on delivering more of that to your audience.</p><h3> 7. Be your brand</h3><p> Embrace your personality online and be yourself. Don&rsquo;t be shy about sharing your unique perspective &ndash; your experience is what makes your knowledge more interesting and engaging. Strive to be the personal brand values you want to be known for.</p><p> <img alt=\"social-selling-manifesto\" src=\"http://jaypalter.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/social-selling-manifesto-621x1024.png\"/></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-27 15:12:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-27 15:12:16.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_zUsgRVv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"post_id\": \"6359\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-27 15:12:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-27 15:12:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6358\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2917\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-9.42.22-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"782\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443467700,"author_id":219,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2843,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Twitter Basics … Updated","link":"twitter-basics-updated","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The mistakes I see being made by brands is trying to measure Social engagement with the same tools we measure every other digital touch point. In my view email, search, even banner ads, have spoiled marketers into thinking everything can be and must be measured with the same metrics used to gauge success in other mediums.</p><p> When initially building a social media audience, and testing it, I have three stages with which I measure:</p><p> <strong>  #1 Audience growth  <br/>  #2 is Reactivity&hellip; getting them to take an action, and  <br/>  #3 Stickiness&hellip; keeping them coming back, engaged and interacting. </strong></p><p> After you achieve all these I feel measurement will easily follow depending upon what is important to you and your brand.</p><p> Want to reach your market? Guess what, the marketing focus needs to be onbuilding relationships, and metrics need to expand beyond ROI (Return on Investment) to include  <a href=\"http://www.tedrubin.com/return-on-relationship-the-new-measure-of-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ROR: Return on Relationship&trade; </a> . If you are not engaging in your field of expertise on Twitter, using hashtags and active listening, someone else is. The first issue is that you are missing that opportunity and handing it to others. Second&hellip; if you are not talking about your business, your customers and prospects probably are, and you are not there to participate, engage, interact and most important for your business&hellip; listen and lead.</p><p> My philosophy is that Twitter is a tool that leads into other forms of social sharing. I consider Twitter a place to lay the groundwork where other people pick up things. Twitter is a seeding medium and a place to build engagement and interaction&hellip; it can be used as a broadcast medium but not to it&rsquo;s greatest effect, so it is not about the quantity of people listening at once, but the ability to lay it out there for those whose attention are drawn to what you have to say at any given moment.</p><p> Twitter is a river that continuously flows, and flows. You add content one second, and the next it is gone. Tweet to keep your brand, personal and business, on your followers&rsquo; radar, increase your following, and provide value that keeps followers listening and you top of mind. Send the same tweet often multiple times in a day if you want it to be seen by a larger percentage of followers and send valuable, evergreen, content repeatedly over the course of time.</p><h3> TWITTER BRANDING &ndash; Visual</h3><p> <br/> Make your cover image, profile pic and link color go with your brand guidelines. Make sure your bio is an eye catcher. Your cover image has huge potential to tell a story about your brand beyond words and will catch people&rsquo;s eyes. Spend a little extra time on the look of your handle &ndash; i.e. no pixelated pictures etc., if possible.</p><h3> TWITTER BRANDING &ndash; Hashtags</h3><p> <br/> Pick a hashtag for a brand/campaign to use on most tweets and encourage anyone involved with you to add that hashtag to their tweets. This allows for easy tracking and active listening. Make your hashtag top of mind.</p><p> Start building Twitter lists of people that you want to pay extra close attention to. Periodically check out these followers to find interesting posts and RT&rsquo;s and show you are paying attention.</p><p> Create internal social media syndication in your company. Maybe a team member sends out weekly tweetables every Monday that makes it easy for coworkers to share? Maybe one employee per week is running your Twitter handle? The key is to get your employees engaged and enthusiastic on what&rsquo;s going on in the Twitter stream.</p><h3> GET AND MAINTAIN FOLLOWERS</h3><p> <br/> Twitter has a cap to the number of people you are allowed to follow vs. how many are following you (caps at 2000, until you get within 5-10% of that in followers). There is a bit of a process to follow, to grow the accounts.</p><p> <strong>  The process: </strong></p><li> Sign into Twitter Handle</li><li> Make sure you are following back everyone who is following you</li><li> Search for a relevant and reliable Twitter Account and/or hashtag <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Example: If you are in the cooking vertical, search a celebrity chef or a cooking mag/site or use a hashtag such as #foodie or #foodshot and follow all of those followers. </strong></p><li> Twitter will stop you when you&rsquo;ve reached the maximum limit of following</li><li> Sign into Crowdfire (an unfollowing and follow back application)&hellip;http://www.crowdfire.com/</li><li> Unfollow those who don&rsquo;t follow you back. <br/> Unfollowing should be done every few days &ndash; not every day. You want to give all the people you just followed a chance to follow you back. If they don&rsquo;t within 72 hours+ depending upon what level you are at and how quickly you hit your follower ceiling, you want to unfollow them to give you more room to find followers that WILL follow you back. People who do not follow you back have no value as far as building your presence. If you are interested in what they have to say you can &ldquo;whitelist&rdquo; them to avoid unfollowing them.</li><li> Following through Crowdfire <br/> By clicking on &ldquo;Copy followers&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll be able to add in a Twitter handle of choice, and follow all the people that are following this person. You&rsquo;ll also be able to add #hashtags and increase your following on a topic basis. <br/>  </li><h3> LOGISTICS OF YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT</h3><p> <br/> I suggest setting up handles with email addresses such  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:twitterhandle@gmail.com\">   twitterhandle@gmail.com  </a> </u> . Twitter only allows one handle per email address.</p><p> All passwords, if you are using multiple handles, can be the same for ease of use (or simply keep a spreadsheet) especially if you are inventorying handles for future use so you never forget how to log in.</p><p> Always remember: If you think nobody is tweeting about your products or services, think again. If you&rsquo;re not tweeting about your business&ndash;someone else is. If you&rsquo;re not setting your own business message on Twitter&ndash;someone else is. But more importantly, if you&rsquo;re not listening to what your customers (and potential customers) are saying on Twitter &ndash; someone else is, and you are missing an incredibly valuable opportunity to engage and interact.</p><h3> TWEETING 101 <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Utilize and attach images to tweets to tell a story </strong></li><li> <strong>  Use your brand hashtag and other relevant tags </strong></li><li> <strong>  Mix up inbound and outbound tweets &ndash; your content and other people&rsquo;s content should have a nice balance </strong></li><li> <strong>  Shorten links when possible (and track them) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Favorite tweets that catch your attention &ndash; this way you can go back and read them again and store them, and give recognition to others for valuable content. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Skip the auto DM (direct message that many send to everyone who follows them). Nobody reads them, but more importantly many find them annoying and spam-like. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Put your humanity and persona on display! Have fun. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> TRACKING AND LISTENING</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Track Mentions: </strong>  The major thing you should be tracking is mentions of your twitter name. Anytime somebody mentions your name, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to start a conversation and acquire a new high quality follower. There are a bunch of listening tools that will allow you to track this.</p><p> <strong>  Track Retweets: </strong>  You should also pay close attention to the people who are retweeting the tweets you have written. It&rsquo;s obvious that they like your content, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t be sharing it, and it is good form to thank them for doing so, and perhaps RT something of theirs if you can find something you deem &ldquo;retweetable.&rdquo;</p><h3> LISTS IDEAS</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Private List of your Competitors: </strong>  To keep track on the market</p><p> <strong>  Public Lists:  </strong> Create public Twitter lists that are related to the product/service you&rsquo;re selling. This will function as a resource and provide value for people that are looking get tips on who to follow in a particular space.</p><p> <strong>  Inner Circle List:  </strong> Have a list called your inner circle. Anytime somebody mentions or retweets you, make a point to add them to that list.</p><p> <strong>  Engage with the People on that List:  </strong> Simply creating the list is not going to be enough. Once you have created your inner circle list, you need to start engaging with them.</p><li> Have periodic conversations.</li><li> Retweet their Tweets and look to periodically RT others to get their attention and interact. I often choose some randomly and make a point at conferences, whether I am there or not, to RT many. If you follow event or group hashtags, and check in on them, you can RT those and it makes it easy to interact. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Where to Start When You Are at Zero: </strong>  If you are starting at zero, some of the above might seem more challenging, but it&rsquo;s not. Just start with bloggers who you have been reading. This is why it&rsquo;s important to read more than just the a-list blogs. Find people you think are interesting and just reach out to them. They&rsquo;ll be happy to hear from you&hellip; bloggers, marketers, brands, and journalists, etc.</p><p> This post originally appeared on  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ted Rubin  </a> </u></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-27 16:48:32.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-27 16:48:32.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_FVmVBux.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/twitter-basics-updated/\", \"post_id\": \"6361\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-27 16:48:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-27 16:48:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"twitter-basics-updated\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6360\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2918\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-10.00.31-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"352\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443445200,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2844,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Five Pros and Cons of Family Business Transfers","link":"the-five-pros-and-cons-of-family-business-transfers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  There are hundreds, probably thousands, of advisors who specialize in family business representation </strong> (perhaps you are one?), hundreds of books about the dynamics of family businesses, and dozens of family business centers dedicated to the success of family-run businesses.  The purpose of this series of articles on family business transfers, however, is to:</p><li> Highlight the challenges and benefits of family business transfers,</li><li> Describe the three essential elements in a successful transfer,</li><li> Reveal the ingredients of the road maps BEI Members create for owners to follow in these transfers,</li><li> Tackle the thorny issues of merit and fairness, and</li><li> Explain the back-up plan necessary for both owner and successor. <br/>  </li><p> Let's start with the benefits and challenges that these transfers present to the brave owners who wish to pass a business to the next generation.</p><h3> Benefits</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Financial Security: </strong>  If you properly structure the transfer for your business-owner clients, they can receive the amount of income they need or want during and after their exit--even if the business value does not justify that sum of money.  Further, you can design the transfer so that owners retain control of their businesses during the buyout period and until they receive all of the money they want and need.</p><p> <strong>  Time:   </strong> If an owner does not want to leave the business today, you can structure the transfer to children to take five to ten years depending on the owner's goals, the abilities of the successor owners and the readiness of the business.</p><p> The length of this exit path gives owners time to slow down, develop other interests and prepare themselves, and their business, for life after the sale.  It also gives owners time to collect income from salary, perks, and distributions while maintaining control.</p><p> <strong>  Taxes: </strong>  Using a strategy unique to family transfers, you can minimize (and often avoid) the income taxes on transfers of ownership to family members.</p><p> <strong>  Values-Based Goals: </strong>  Owners often choose to transfer their businesses to children because, if done correctly, it achieves so many of their values-based goals.  These include:</p><li> Continuing the joy and satisfaction they gain from working with their children during and after the ownership transfer.</li><li> Offering children greater employment and financial opportunities than available elsewhere.</li><li> Maintaining the business as the \"glue\" that holds the family together.</li><li> Fulfilling the expectations of children who have grown up in the business, know, want to stay in, and one day, run it.</li><li> Reaping considerable (and justifiable) satisfaction from family tradition and values that benefit family, employees, customers and community. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Known Successor: </strong>  When the successor owner is one's child(ren) rather than a third party, owners know all about their honesty, work ethic, leadership and management skills.</p><h3> Challenges</h3><p> <br/> How can an exit path that has so many advantages crash so often and so spectacularly into the brick wall of reality?  The following reasons come immediately to mind.</p><p> <strong>  Financial Security: </strong>  Basing a business transfer on family ties, especially ties to someone who can't or won't run the business properly is a huge threat to the parent's financial security and the very existence of the business.  Owners put their financial security at risk when they transfer voting control to children before the owners achieve financial independence and children are prepared to run the company successfully.</p><p> <strong>  Time: </strong>  If an owner wants to leave the business within a year, remind them that getting paid full value for the company from children generally takes several more years than it does from third parties or Employee Stock Ownership Plans.  The longer buyout period of a family transfer (like that of any inside transfer) also extends the period of time that the owner (and thus his or her exit goals) is exposed to general business risk.</p><p> <strong>  Taxes: </strong>  Without careful tax planning owners can pay far more in taxes than necessary when transferring ownership to children.  With planning, owners often pay no capital gains, gift or estate taxes when transferring ownership to family members.</p><p> <strong>  Values-Based Goals: </strong>  As you have likely experienced, when family transfers run amok, they can destroy businesses and families.</p><li> If children don't get along with each other when they aren't working together, can owners expect them to behave well when they are forced to work together?</li><li> Transferring the ownership of the family jewel--the business--to children often exacerbates existing family friction, and a perception of unequal treatment among siblings, between parents and children, and between owner and spouse.  Let's not forget the often-hidden discontent of sons- and daughter-in-laws who I refer to as \"The Gatekeepers to the Grandchildren.\"</li><li> Communication among family members is emotional in a way it is not between unrelated third parties.  If advisors do not manage communication early, correctly and continuously, it can create or add fuel to family discord. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Questionable Successor: </strong>  If an owner's goal is to transfer a business to children, you must ask that owner:</p><li> Does your designated successor share your vision of the business's future?</li><li> Will the choice of your successor please the other members of your family?  If not, then what?</li><li> Can your successor match your desire, ambition, and aptitude for running the business? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  If children can't run the business without the parent or squabble with one another in the business, the owner will return both to the business and to the parenting business. </strong></p><p> Not one of these challenges is insurmountable unless you fail to help owners to recognize the existence and significance of each and create a written and comprehensive road map to address them.  That map should take owners from where they are today (running a successful business) to where they want to be (living a financially secure life, watching their offspring run the family business and enjoying family harmony).</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-27 17:04:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-27 17:04:12.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_3ifo2r8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-five-pros-and-cons-of-family-business-transfers/\", \"post_id\": \"6363\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-27 17:04:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-27 17:04:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-five-pros-and-cons-of-family-business-transfers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6362\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2919\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443160454178-31a9c846eb53-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"927\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443437100,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Before you quit, ask yourself the questions below. Use it as your checklist to reflect and redesign before you resign.</p><p> Before we jump into the questions, with my client&rsquo;s permission, I wanted to share a part of her journey in the hope that you may see an echo of your own. Jenny wanted to create a business and do work that made her feel fulfilled, whole, like she was living with purpose. Sound familiar?</p><p> Once a manager in a large organization and now a stay-at-home mom, she wanted to rejoin the workforce and decided to become a coach. In a flurry of activity, she took a coach training course, built a website with a blog and even got a couple of subscribers with her first few posts. She&rsquo;d been on Facebook forever and as a part of her business launch created a Twitter profile, LinkedIn profile and, of course, jumped on Instagram and Pinterest too.</p><p> She posted and waited. </p><p> She blogged and waited.</p><p> Nothing. </p><p> It was time to shake things up, and she went to the Chamber of Commerce and attended a networking event quickly followed by two more. One of her new contacts invited her to BNI, so she went there too.</p><p> She networked and waited.</p><p> Nada.</p><p> Someone told her to email her contacts to let them know about her services, so she did. She wrote a long email offering a sample session over coffee and sent the note to all of her gmail contacts and blasted LinkedIn too.</p><p> This time, a few people sent a note of congratulations in return.</p><p> Clients? Zip. </p><p> Enough waiting, she took it a step further and donated her services to an auction at her child&rsquo;s school.

The question she posed was &ldquo;Should I just give up?&rdquo; She qualified it with &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done everything I can, and it&rsquo;s not working.&rdquo;</p><p> There&rsquo;s a lot packed in that statement, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done everything&hellip;&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m still struggling with success, aka a failure. </p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Focus+on+fulfillment%2C+go+beyond+the+trappings+of+success.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/before-you-quit-your-biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Focus on fulfillment, go beyond the trappings of success. </a></p><p> Over our time working together, Jenny and I dove into many of the following thoughts and questions. Today, I invie you to reflect on your experience. If the answers don&rsquo;t roll off of your tongue, sit with the questions, they&rsquo;ll come in time.</p><h3> 10 Questions to Ask Before You Quit and Give up on Your Biz</h3><h3> <br/> 1) What&rsquo;s fulfilling?</h3><p> What do you absolutely love to do? There are many ways to apply your passion, don&rsquo;t box yourself in before you break free from your expectations and assumptions.</p><h3> 2) What is success? </h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/packing-success-suitcase/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What does success look like  </a> </u>  to you? Big corporate-like success, something small yet robust or what? Try to move away from a dollar figure your primary answer to this question. Instead of &ldquo;I want to make $100,000 a year,&rdquo; try &ldquo;I want to pay my mortgage, car, buy gifts for people I love and go on vacation.&rdquo; It may take far less dollars to create the life you want than you think.</p><h3> 3) Are you falling short of what you see others accomplish, yet on track for what you want in your life and business?</h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/break-free-comparison-trap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stop comparing  </a> </u> . Anyone who tells you that following a path to success that someone else paved will work for you is a liar. You need to lay each brick on the road with your work and effort.</p><h3> 4) What do you offer? How is it the same and different from the 25 billion other people who do what you do?</h3><p> Be clear on what you offer and how YOU do it. Don&rsquo;t compete on price, you bring too much to the table to be defined by the $$ in your proposal or your bank account.</p><h3> 5) Do you only share what you know or who you are too?</h3><p> Be vulnerable, people want to work with another human being, not only a brand. Enough said.</p><h3> 6) When was the last time you truly pushed your limits?</h3><p> Leave your comfort zone &ndash; by miles, not inches. Brainstorm for a minute or two on the things you could do and make yourself uncomfortable (leave judgment at the door). Now, decide what one you actually will do from a &ldquo;leap&rdquo; mindset instead of a &ldquo;fail&rdquo; mindset. You can always  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/comfort-zone-isnt-your-enemy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   come back to your comfort zone to reflect and regroup  </a> </u> , it&rsquo;s not your enemy.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Use+your+comfort+zone+as+a+trampoline%2C+taking+you+higher%2C+not+velcro+keeping+you+stuck.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/before-you-quit-your-biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Use your comfort zone as a trampoline, taking you higher, not velcro keeping you stuck. </a></p><h3> 7) How will people engage with you?</h3><p> Create a diversity of ways for people to engage and hire you. Is the only option face to face? How else can people tap into your expertise, even on demand? Don&rsquo;t gloss over this question just because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s done&rdquo; in your industry. Get creative.</p><h3> 8) Is every step draining your energy?</h3><p> Not everything you do for your business is going to be the fun stuff. However, equally true, not everything you do should be so gosh darn awful you hate every moment of it, or it&rsquo;s 10% fun and 90% pain. Even hard work can be energizing when you&rsquo;re doing the work you&rsquo;re meant to do. Look at your ratios and be honest. Changing up what you&rsquo;re doing may help your energy to soar too.</p><h3> 9) Are you hiding behind &ldquo;I tried?&rdquo;</h3><p> Telling yourself that you&rsquo;ve tried and failed is an excuse to stop. Dissect and reflect instead. Write down what worked from each of your attempts (even if it mostly was a bust). It&rsquo;s easy only to see the bad, look more closely to find seeds of success to carry forward.</p><h3> 10) Do I quit and move on or keep going?</h3><p> If you&rsquo;ve truly pushed as far as you can, have  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/clear-the-dust-off-of-your-passion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lost your passion  </a> </u> , or found a new one, it may be time to move on. This is a question that you often can&rsquo;t answer without working through the nine that came before. The only word of caution I can offer is not to let your emotions dictate your decision. Struggle is painful, and we&rsquo;re wired to get rid of the pain and find ease once again. However, when you give up on something that truly matters, that hurts too.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=You+can+do+whatever+you+want%2C+you+just+need+to+decide+what+it+is+and+go+for+it.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/before-you-quit-your-biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  You can do whatever you want, you just need to decide what it is and go for it. </a></p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t believe people who tell you that giving up isn&rsquo;t an option, it is &ndash; so is reinvention. </strong>  Get clear on WHO you want to be, WHY you&rsquo;re letting go, WHAT you want to do now and HOW you can make it happen ( <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/4-ways-to-overcome-indecision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   define your next step  </a> </u>  even if you don&rsquo;t know the last).</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-27 17:16:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-27 17:16:10.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_yUQuQ8u.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-must-ask-questions-before-you-quit-your-biz/\", \"post_id\": \"6365\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-27 17:16:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-27 17:16:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-must-ask-questions-before-you-quit-your-biz\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6364\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2920\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443178344063-6975f51882ec-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"753\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443466800,"author_id":15,"chart_url":""}

These Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (or  <u>  <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/hecm/hecmhome\" target=\"_blank\">   HECMs  </a> </u> ) are secured by the equity in borrowers&rsquo; houses, and the loans are repaid only when they move or die. The loans are federally insured to ensure that borrowers get all the funds they&rsquo;re promised, even if the lender fails, and that lenders are repaid, even if the value of the property securing the loan declines.</p><p> A June 2015 regulation effectively allows lenders to permit a surviving, non-borrowing spouse to remain in the home, postponing loan repayment until she moves or dies. <strong>  To qualify, the original reverse mortgage must have been approved by the Federal Housing Administration prior to August 4, 2014, and the property tax and insurance payments must be up to date and other conditions met. </strong></p><p> The spousal provision adds to earlier changes, detailed in a 2014  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/briefs/the-government%E2%80%99s-redesigned-reverse-mortgage-program/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   report  </a> </u>  by the Center for Retirement Research, aimed at improving the HECM program&rsquo;s fiscal viability while protecting borrowers and lenders. These regulations were a response to riskier homeowners who had tapped their home equity to cope with the Great Recession. The regulations reduced the amount of equity that borrowers could extract upfront and also introduced financial assessments of homeowners to ensure they&rsquo;re able to pay their taxes and insurance.</p><p> <strong>  Today, the maximum amount allowed for a reverse mortgage is calculated based on the value of the home (up to a $625,000 value) </strong> , current interest rates, and the borrower&rsquo;s age. Homeowners generally are limited to borrowing just 60 percent of that personal maximum in the first year of the loan.</p><p> When the reverse mortgage closes, borrowers pay an insurance premium equal to 0.5 percent of their house&rsquo;s value, which can be paid using funds from the loan. They also pay an annual insurance fee of 1.25 percent of the loan amount, in addition to the normal interest charges.</p><p> <strong>  Despite the changes, few people have a reverse mortgage &ndash; just 52,757 were approved in   <u>   <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=AR2014MMIHECMRpt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">    2014   </a>  </u>  . </strong>  But as more baby boomers reach retirement with insufficient savings, more of them should consider a reverse mortgage as one option for supporting their retirement needs.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/special-projects/books/using-your-house-for-income-in-retirement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here  </a> </u>  for the Center&rsquo;s booklet explaining how reverse mortgages can provide retirement income.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-27 17:27:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-27 17:27:58.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Kc5EfOI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/changes-to-reverse-mortgages-continue/\", \"post_id\": \"6367\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-27 17:27:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-27 17:27:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"changes-to-reverse-mortgages-continue\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6366\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2921\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-10.31.23-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"328\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443452400,"author_id":280,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2847,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Divorcing? 11 Strategies To Get You Through The Transition","link":"divorcing-11-strategies-to-get-you-through-the-transition","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  There&rsquo;s no way to make divorce easy. </strong> You can only try to make the process easier&mdash;and that&rsquo;s going to be a little different for everyone. However, if you can hold tight, believe in yourself, and learn how to manage your thoughts (even the dark ones) and feelings (which are all over the place), there will be a light at the end of the tunnel (and no, it won&rsquo;t be an oncoming train). Try these strategies to help get you through:</p><p> <strong>  Rally Your Team. </strong>  This means create a network of people who will support and guide you. These people may include an attorney, a divorce financial advisor, a divorce mediator, friends, family, church, mentor, support groups, etc. Continue to cultivate your personal relationships. Remember, your loved ones want to help you!</p><p> <strong>  Fasten Your Seatbelt. </strong>  Divorce is an emotional roller coaster. Ever been on a roller coaster? You are afraid to get on, but once you do, you lower the bar and hang on. You know that the ride will be filled with moments of calmness, excitement, fear, and angst. During this time in your life, your feelings will follow suit, ranging from anger, sadness, and disappointment to happiness and relief. And sometimes, you might feel all of these things at once.</p><p> <strong>  Keep Calm and Carry On.  </strong> Give yourself a break and take it easy. Not every day has to productive. A little meditation, mindfulness, and time out is crucial for your long-term health.</p><p> <strong>  Create and Maintain Structure. </strong>  Going to work everyday, having a purpose, and creating short- and long-term goals provides structure and purpose. You need this. Days become weeks which turn into months. Too much free time often results in feelings of restlessness, anxiety, questioning your decisions, and negative thinking.</p><p> <strong>  Silence Your Inner Critic. </strong>  Find ways to be kind to yourself in both voice and behaviors. Limit the &ldquo;should&rsquo;ve, could&rsquo;ve, would&rsquo;ves.&rdquo; These thoughts often leave you feeling worse about your divorce&mdash;and yourself. Instead, try to force yourself to be objective and give yourself a fair assessment of the situation. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you be giving her?</p><p> <strong>  Make Healthy Choices. </strong>  Unfortunately, the healthy habits that many of us have are often the first things to go. Don&rsquo;t do it! Smart food choices, regular exercise (even a daily walk), sunshine, and Vitamin D are vital. Also, keep an eye on emotional eating. Are you eating through your feelings? This is detrimental not only because of the potential weight gain, but because you&rsquo;re not acknowledging your feelings; if you&rsquo;re not aware of the behavior, it could soon become a conditioned response to overwhelming emotions.</p><p> <strong>  Speak your Mind! Use Your Voice! </strong>  This includes setting boundaries and saying no to things without the guilt. What are your needs? What would help you during this time of transition? Learn how to be assertive and state your needs.</p><p> <strong>  Curb Alcohol. </strong>  It&rsquo;s not uncommon to turn to alcohol to take the edge off. The downside? Drinking in times of distress could become automatic&mdash;it&rsquo;s a risky habit that can get worse, quickly. If you find yourself pouring a drink more often than usual, stop and ask &ndash; Am I using alcohol to numb my feelings? If you think you might be, or if you&rsquo;re often thinking that you deserve that drink because of everything you&rsquo;re going through, you might be heading down a dangerous path. It&rsquo;s important to reach out to your doctor or therapist right away, especially if you&rsquo;re already struggling to cut back on your own.</p><p> <strong>  Consider Outside Help. </strong>  Some people benefit from working with divorce therapist or a divorce coach. Each provides a different level of support, depending on your needs. Therapists will not only guide you through the immediacy of the divorce transition, they&rsquo;ll also help you examine all aspects of your life, including the roles your extended family, your childhood, and past relationships might be playing in your recovery. Divorce coaches, on the other hand, work to identify the issues that are most concerning to clients right now and offer additional support. They generally don&rsquo;t take a deeper dive into your history. Either way, do not be apprehensive about interviewing more than one therapist or coach. It&rsquo;s important to find the best fit for you and figure out what who is the best person to help you at this particular time in your life.</p><p> <strong>  Schedule in Worry Time. </strong>  Getting stuck in a negative thought process is not only counterproductive, it&rsquo;s also unhealthy. That said, it&rsquo;s unrealistic to think that you won&rsquo;t ever be wracked by sadness, worry, or anger. But instead of letting these thoughts just take over willy-nilly, set aside 15 or 30 minutes a day to slide down that rabbit hole. We call that &lsquo;worry time.&rsquo; The catch: When time&rsquo;s up, it&rsquo;s up. Though it may seem counterintuitive to let yourself wallow, by imposing the structure of a time limit, you&rsquo;ll eventually start to gain control over that negative thinking pattern. Eventually, you will find that setting aside worry time becomes burdensome and something you no longer want to do. When you notice a difficult thought starting to pop up, just remind yourself, that you have time set aside to worry and that you have to postpone the thought until your scheduled time.</p><p> <strong>  Focus on Your Future. </strong>  Yes, it IS about you. And so is finding peace and creating new hopes for your future. Although you are grieving the loss of one dream, now&rsquo;s the time to focus on building a different future for yourself. In some ways, your future is a blank slate waiting to be filled in. That can be hugely exciting. Before you know it, you will begin to feel that your life is yours again and experience happiness. Your resilience will astound you, and your &ldquo;one day this will be all better&rdquo; mantra will have arrived.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-27 17:36:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-27 17:36:07.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_KEx0vC4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/divorcing-11-strategies-to-get-you-through-the-transition/\", \"post_id\": \"6369\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-27 17:36:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-27 17:36:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"divorcing-11-strategies-to-get-you-through-the-transition\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6368\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2922\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-10.42.19-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"541\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443459600,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2848,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"14 Strategies to Win New Clients","link":"14-strategies-to-win-new-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Even if you&rsquo;re good at retaining your relationships for the long term, it&rsquo;s essential to add new clients each year. These could be brand new names, or new clients within existing client companies where there are multiple economic buying units and businesses. I&rsquo;m going to walk through about a dozen essential strategies that will enable you to turn contacts into clients.</p><h3> One</h3><p> <strong>  Think like a client advisor, not an expert for hire. </strong>  The difference is profound, and if you can capture the &ldquo;advisor mindset,&rdquo; you will dramatically alter the way you approach building your client relationships&mdash;right from the first meeting. Experts tell; advisors ask great questions and listen. Experts are specialists; advisors are deep generalists who have a deep specialty but also a breadth of knowledge about their clients&rsquo; business, industry, and competitive environment. Experts have relatively few client meetings because they have to prepare so much; advisors know that a cup of coffee and a vibrant conversation is welcomed by clients and adds value. Experts focus on methodologies; advisors focus on client needs.</p><h3> Two</h3><p> <strong>  Clarify your value proposition. </strong>  Most professionals describe what they do by saying things like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an executive coach&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do process improvement consulting.&rdquo; You need to frame what you do in terms of the value you provide to your clients, not the methodology you use. My value proposition, for example, is that I help individuals and companies develop their clients for life. You should have a short and a long version of your value proposition. The former should be 10 words or less, the latter 50 words or less. The long version, for example, can provide a little more detail about the types of clients you work with, the industries you focus on, and/or the variety of benefits you deliver.</p><h3> Three</h3><p> <strong>  Develop your marketing gravity*&mdash;your ability to attract leads. </strong> A &ldquo;push&rdquo; strategy, where you are constantly knocking on doors and pitching your services to convince clients to buy, is very hard work. A &ldquo;pull&rdquo; strategy is where clients call you based on receiving a referral from another client, reading an article or blog, or hearing a keynote speech. Most everyone knows that this is the gold standard&mdash;waking up to an email that says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an issue I want to talk to you about&rdquo;&mdash;but fewer are willing to put in the hard work required to create this marketing gravity. The trick lies in a careful selection of your attraction strategy, from among many, and then methodical execution. Remember, even if your firm has a world-renowned brand, you still need to develop a personal brand which attracts sole-source leads. (*this expression was coined by my friend and author Alan Weiss).</p><h3> Four</h3><p> <strong>  Understand what clients really want. There are four things that all clients always want </strong> &mdash;and some others that are situational based on the client&rsquo;s particular needs and buying habits. These four are:</p><li> <strong>  Delivery </strong> &mdash;you have to come through for clients on your core products and services, with a high level of client service and quality.</li><li> <strong>  A Relationship of Trust </strong> &mdash;clients must believe you will put their interests first and come through for them.</li><li> <strong>  Value </strong> &mdash;there must be an acceptable ratio of benefits to cost.</li><li> <strong>  Likeability </strong> &mdash;clients do business with people they like. In addition to these there will also be value items or benefits that are specific to each individual client. <br/>  </li><h3> Five</h3><p> <strong>  Make sure your client is ready and able to buy. </strong>  In a recent newsletter I set out the six preconditions for a contact to become a paying client. The first of these this that the client must perceive a problem or opportunity that is significant. It it&rsquo;s a problem it must be causing a major deviation from expected results, and if it&rsquo;s an opportunity it must offer a major payoff. Otherwise, why would they hire you? The client you are speaking with must also own the issue and be able to act on it&mdash;he/she must be an economic buyer, otherwise you will spin your wheels talking to someone who is not empowered to act and to pay your fees.</p><h3> Six</h3><p> <strong>  Create a buyer by uncovering an important need and building trust in your ability to address it. </strong> The &ldquo;sales process&rdquo; can take one hour or four different meetings, but in order to achieve a sale&mdash;to create a buyer&mdash;you have to identify and explore a need, develop an agreed approach, and get the go-ahead to proceed. People tend to overreach in first meetings. They feel under pressure to achieve way too many things, often with a senior executive they have never met before or barely know, and the result is a good first meeting that goes nowhere. You have four essential objectives in that first conversation: Build rapport, identify their issues, build your credibility, and get a next step.</p><h3> Seven</h3><p> <strong>  Persuade by showing, not telling.  </strong> This is so important it&rsquo;s a strategy of its own. During the sales process, most professionals give clients lots of narrative description. They describe their firm, their methodologies, their resumes, their points of differentiation, and so on. Often, these descriptions are backed up by large PowerPoint slide decks. Clients, however, are persuaded by examples, stories, and illustrations&ndash;not narrative. The most basic example of this is how you describe your company. Do you list facts and statistics? Or do you share short examples of recent client engagements that you know will be especially relevant to the client you&rsquo;re talking to? Do you talk about your five-step approach or do you share insights about competitors and best practices you&rsquo;ve seen?</p><h3> Eight</h3><p> <strong>  Step back and review your opportunity pipeline. </strong> Your total revenues are a function of four factors: The number of opportunities you get to see; the percentage of those that you get to write a proposal for; your proposal win rate; and the average project or transaction size. Look at your equation: Where are you weak? Where are you strong? There are two ways to \"see\" new opportunities: Clients can call you, and say, &ldquo;I want to talk to you about an issue&rdquo; (\"Marketing Gravity\" is at work in this case); or, you can go knock on doors and prospect for opportunities. Are you getting your share of incoming leads? Are you also proactively getting out and calling on potential new clients or new buyers within existing clients?</p><h3> Nine</h3><p> <strong>  In first meetings, focus first on building rapport and setting out a &ldquo;Point of View.&rdquo; </strong> These start the relationship-building process. Rapport-building takes place during the small talk, where you discuss current events and identify things and people you have in common. After agreeing the agenda (or reconfirming it), you can use the &ldquo;Point of View&rdquo; (POV) to get into a discussion and kick things off. The POV is a brief statement about how you see the markets, the competition, key trends in the industry, etc. It might be 50-75 words long, but probably no more. (Note: Chapter 5, \"Engaging New Clients,\" of my recent book All for One , sets out a number of essential engagement strategies for winning new clients).</p><h3> Ten</h3><p> <strong>  Always use short client examples, as illustrations, early on in the relationship-building process. </strong> Use &ldquo;What We Finds&rdquo; that describe what you do and the kinds of issues you work on&ndash;rather than long narrative descriptions that are invariably unconvincing. Short client examples are very effective for building your credibility and also stimulating a discussion about a client&rsquo;s own challenging issues. These examples should only be around 50 words long (they must be very short), and they should be chosen for their potential relevancy to the client&rsquo;s known issues and strategic goals. Describe the client&rsquo;s problem, your solution, and the impact or results.</p><h3> Eleven</h3><p> <strong>  During the sales process, be prepared for tough questions and objections. </strong> Sooner or later you&rsquo;re going to get asked questions like &ldquo;How are you different?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Exactly how much experience do you personally have in this area?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll also have to deal with objections such as, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too expensive&rdquo; or &ldquo;We are too busy with other things to start on this now.&rdquo; Always use objections as opportunities to ask more questions and find out more about the issue. How urgent is it? How much pain is it causing? If it&rsquo;s important, why is it not a priority? How much do they think it&rsquo;s worth to fix it? Answer tough questions with examples, illustrations, and counter-questions&ndash;not just assertions.</p><h3> Twelve</h3><p> <strong>  Only write a proposal when all the right conditions are satisfied. </strong> Is this the right client for you? Is it the right issue&mdash;and if not, should you be helping the client to redefine it? Do you fully understand the client&rsquo;s objectives? Is the buying process transparent, and have you met with the economic buyer? Do you understand what is most important to the client&mdash;what outcomes they will most value from your proposal? Have you gained &ldquo;conceptual approval&rdquo; of the basic approach? If you cannot answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to all of these questions, you should not invest the time to write a proposal because you may very well be wasting that time. See my article on this, \"Don&rsquo;t Write a Proposal Just Yet.\"</p><h3> Thirteen</h3><p> <strong>  Build relationships with senior economic buyers in the C-suite. </strong> Too many service providers and professional advisors are content to work with junior clients at low levels in their client&rsquo;s organization. How relevant will you ever be to that client if you are buried deep within their organization? How much impact can you have? How can you really understand how your services or products fit into the overall context of business strategies and goals? Moving up in the organization, however, requires a different level of understanding of your client and a more nuanced sales process. Senior executives are uninterested in &ldquo;methodologies&rdquo; but rather want to know if and how you can help them achieve their business goals. They are extremely pressed for time&mdash;and therefore you have to learn how to add value for time (see my full article on this, \"Value for Time\"). They absorb information rapidly, and will rarely sit through long, drawn-out presentations. In the c-suite, who you know can become as important as what you know.</p><h3> Fourteen</h3><p> <strong>  Become an agenda setter. </strong> If you want to create additional opportunities with existing clients&mdash;and if you want to be perceived as truly having something substantive to offer to brand new clients who don&rsquo;t know you very well&mdash;you must be proactive. But you must be proactive in a way that is relevant. This means understanding your client&rsquo;s &ldquo;agenda&rdquo; of 3-5 critical business and 3-5 critical personal priorities, and framing all of your discussions around them. There are lots of things can be proactive about, but if your client doesn&rsquo;t perceive them to be helpful to resolving their most urgent issues, there will be little serious interest. Remember, if you&rsquo;re an agenda reactor, you&rsquo;ll be constantly bidding for work in RFPs, whereas if you&rsquo;re an agenda setter, you&rsquo;ll create sole sourced business.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 14:14:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 14:14:45.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_dvjIndS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/14-strategies-to-win-new-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"6371\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 14:14:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 14:14:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"14-strategies-to-win-new-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6370\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2923\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443304895043-ef30921332c5-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"869\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443524400,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

Something happens that you cannot control and negatively affects your big project; your boss responds with something unflattering about your leadership style and/or your ability to deliver; your whole team gets negative feedback from a senior leader about the missed deadline.</p><h3> You are mad; this is not fair!</h3><p> <br/> This is unjust; you say to yourself, we could not meet the deadline for obvious reasons.</p><p> The next time you see your boss, you get triggered again, and when he or she asks what you think about a new project, you are still fired up about the last project. You go over it and over it, you re-explain, re-defend, and maybe raise your voice a bit and start looking to lay blame. So your boss possibly takes a step back and stops engaging you about the new project. What is happening here? What is going on inside your head and body? You are experiencing the emotion of anger turned into Resentment. Let&rsquo;s explore this.</p><p> At its core, it would seem that what is causing the emotion of Resentment in the previous example is that the boss questioned your leadership style and the senior leader gave negative feedback. Not it. The real cause is that you did not accept the fact that the boss said what he or she said about your leadership style, and the senior leader&rsquo;s comments about your team. You could not let it go. You are continually triggered because you believe your boss and the team boss should have said something else. The fact is that they did not; they said what they said. This is where Resentment comes from: not accepting what is and letting go of anger to make a new decision about how to move forward. Our anger/resentment is triggered because we have  <a href=\"http://www.croftandcompany.com/do-you-have-your-assessment-or-does-it-have-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  assessments </a>  of what we think should be &ndash; not what is. And this non-acceptance shapes how we see the world. If our explanations and rehashing do not cause the bosses to change their minds and apologize, (good luck with that) then inevitably, the next stop is Resentment.</p><p> <strong>  I invite you to become an ontological observer (ontology- the study of being human) and look at three areas where Resentment can manifest itself: </strong></p><p> <strong>  1. Language &ndash; When we are in the mood of Resentment we have an internal conversation that goes something like this </strong> , &ldquo;X has happened, and it is not fair, it should be Y, I do not deserve to be treated this way.&rdquo; When this conversation is happening our focus is on our hurt and anger, and this leads to the snarky remark about the boss, or the rejection of a good idea as a form of payback. We ask, &ldquo;How can I get even with those who caused me to feel this way?&rdquo; as opposed to asking, &ldquo;What can I do to rectify the situation, or prevent it from happening again?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2. The Body &ndash; Resentment creates tension as we fight what is happening. </strong> We are angry so our body reflects that with a cluster of reactions. It shows up as tightness in our muscles commensurate to the level of our Resentment. It shows up in our facial muscles, especially in our jaws, eye muscles, and forehead. We will also likely see tension in our neck, shoulders, upper and lower back and our arms and legs.</p><p> <strong>  3. Behavioral Disposition &ndash; This is the behavior or actions we are likely going to take based on the emotion we are currently experiencing. </strong> The mood of Resentment pulls our focus and goals toward punishing the person we think has wronged us, bringing them down a bit. Over time, if this issue is not resolved our focus can become more and more intense, triggering us the moment that we interact with the person.</p><p> The challenge with Resentment is that it can grow from one incident and build to intense moods focused on the person or people who caused the perceived injustice in the beginning. <strong>  As a leader it is critical that you become aware of this basic mood/emotion and the effect that it can have on you and your team. </strong> The sooner you do, the sooner you can get yourself and your team focused on the positive future you can create, as opposed to being held back by old grievances. In our next blog we will look at Acceptance, the antidote to Resentment.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 15:50:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 15:50:20.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_7v1Ed8W.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-power-of-resentment-the-desire-to-get-even/\", \"post_id\": \"6373\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 15:50:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 15:50:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-power-of-resentment-the-desire-to-get-even\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6372\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2924\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Resentment-Tornado-2-800x390.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1039\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443527100,"author_id":120,"chart_url":""}

Hers was not one of them.</p><p> I listened patiently as she went through her pitch, and at the end she offered us a special opportunity to buy 20% of her business for $250,000.</p><h3> There was just one problem.</h3><p> <br/> She didn&rsquo;t have a business. There were no employees, no team, no product, no prototype, no design, no revenue, no testing, no website, no assets.</p><p> She didn&rsquo;t even have a company or a bank account.</p><p> She had nothing but an idea.</p><p> And based on her calculations, she thought her idea was worth $1 million.</p><p> (This is what&rsquo;s known as a &lsquo;pre-money valuation&rsquo;. The &lsquo;post-money&rsquo; valuation would be $1 million plus the $250,000 investment capital = $1.25MM. We would own 20% of that, or $250k/$1.25MM)</p><p> Yes, it&rsquo;s true that a great business is the best asset you can own.</p><p> But as I tell students at our annual entrepreneurship camps, the most important aspect of any business is execution&ndash; the ability to turn an idea into a plan and methodically bring everything to life.</p><p> You can have the most fantastic idea. But without execution, an idea is worth absolutely nothing.</p><h3> Needless to say we passed on the deal.</h3><p> <br/> But the conversation was a clear reminder of how little value there is to money anymore. There&rsquo;s simply too much of it in the system.</p><p> Central bankers have spent years printing trillions of dollars. In the United States, the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet is 5x bigger than it was seven years ago.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s not like the US economy is 5x bigger. Or 5x as much productivity. Or 5x as many goods and services.</p><p> No, there&rsquo;s just 5x as much paper floating around the financial system.</p><p> (Though technically not even paper. Our money is electronic&ndash; a series of ledgers in bank databases, as if your life savings is represented in a single cell somewhere on Janet Yellen&rsquo;s spreadsheet.)</p><p> Over that same period, they&rsquo;ve decreased interest rates to effectively 0%.</p><p> And after yesterday&rsquo;s speech, the Fed has even opened the door to making rates negative.</p><h3> Just consider what that means.</h3><p> <br/> Money, like anything else, has a price. When you want to consume a hamburger, you pay the price of a hamburger.</p><p> If you want to consume money (i.e. borrow to buy a house or build a factory), you have to pay the price of money.</p><p> That price is the interest rate.</p><p> By setting interest rates at zero, the Fed is telling the world that money is free, i.e. that the US dollar is worth nothing.</p><p> (Negative interest rates imply the dollar is worth less than nothing.)</p><p> After my conversation with this young entrepreneur, that seems abundantly clear.</p><p> With no execution, her idea is fundamentally worthless. But she wants one million dollars for it.</p><p> So based on my math, if $1 million = her idea = worthless, then the value of a single US dollar is 1/1,000,000 of worthless.</p><p> Look, we&rsquo;re in a period right now where US dollars are relatively &lsquo;strong&rsquo;&hellip; against oil, foreign currencies, etc.</p><p> People often think that when something is strong, whether a nation or a currency, that it will be strong forever.</p><h3> This is a major fallacy.</h3><p> <br/> It wasn&rsquo;t even four years ago that the Japanese yen peaked at 76 per US dollar. Today it has weakened to 120.</p><p> In July 2008 the euro was worth almost $1.60. Now it&rsquo;s $1.11.</p><p> It&rsquo;s all part of a cycle. Currencies, like nations, rise, peak, and decline.</p><p> That&rsquo;s absolutely going to happen to the dollar as well, especially when so much objective, everyday evidence suggests that it is excessively overvalued.</p><p> What this means is that if you are holding US dollars, you have a once-in-a-decade chance to trade something that is fundamentally worthless and objectively overvalued, for something that is real and undervalued.</p><p> In our case, we&rsquo;ve loaded up on productive farmland here in Chile.</p><p> We&rsquo;re also working on buying a profitable business in Australia at a time when the Aussie dollar has been punished.</p><p> Next week, I&rsquo;m off to Colombia, where the peso has sunk below 3,000, to look at property.</p><p> If you have limited funds, there are shares of foreign companies (junior mining stocks, resources companies, macro ETFs in places like Indonesia and Colombia, etc.) that are trading for less than their net asset values AND pay solid dividends.</p><p> No one has a crystal ball, so it&rsquo;s impossible to say precisely when it will turn. This part of the cycle could last weeks, months, or years.</p><p> Even if it does take years, though, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine being worse off for buying a profitable business or shares of a well-managed company that pays a 6% dividend.</p><p> These are sensible investments no matter what.</p><p> But at some point down the road, the inescapable gravitational pull of fiscal reality will pull the dollar back down.</p><p> And just as the dollar&rsquo;s strength has become way OVERvalued, the next part of the cycle will probably punish the dollar just as much.</p><p> Which makes this time, right now, a gift. Use it to build for the future, because it won&rsquo;t last.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 17:23:43.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 17:23:43.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_me85e2W.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ive-finally-calculated-the-value-of-a-dollar/\", \"post_id\": \"6377\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 17:23:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 17:23:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ive-finally-calculated-the-value-of-a-dollar\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6376\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2927\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-28-at-10.24.28-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"706\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443531600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Rather,  <u>  <a href=\"http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/bring-your-own-apps-BYOA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BYOA  </a> </u>  means that employees use the apps they already have on their phones and other smart devices as an adjunct to their work.</p><p> Some companies, especially smaller ones, see BYOA as a  <u>  money-saving, and even money-making, tool </u> . &ldquo;BYOA also provides significant benefits to businesses, including lower capital expenditures for software purchases and licensing and reduced training requirements, since employees choose the apps with which they are most comfortable and proficient,&rdquo; writes Inc.</p><p> It&rsquo;s all part of what some call the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/users-increasingly-rely-on-ecm-aiim-survey-says/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   consumerization of IT  </a> </u> .&rdquo; Typically these apps are free and many of them are geared toward the consumer rather than the enterprise. But if it does the job, why not? &ldquo;Cited benefits of  <u>  <a href=\"http://searchconsumerization.techtarget.com/definition/IT-consumerization-information-technology-consumerization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IT consumerization  </a> </u>  and the use of consumer applications include greater employee engagement and satisfaction as well as improved productivity,&rdquo; notes Margaret Rouse in TechTarget.</p><p> And, not to put too fine a point on it, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to stop users from running their own apps anyway. &ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t matter if IT formally rejects BYOD&mdash;or Bring Your Own Apps&mdash;because it&rsquo;s happening anyway,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2466634/byod/workers-going-rogue-with-byod-and-byoa.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   warns Tom Kaneshige in CIO  </a> </u> . Citing an industry survey, he notes that more than half of employees admit to using their own apps to do their jobs. Worse, many of them keep it hidden from IT, he writes.</p><p> What leads users to BYOA? &ldquo;40 percent of respondents say their company doesn&rsquo;t have the budget for the right technology tools,&rdquo; Kaneshige writes. &ldquo;A similar percentage say their company provides tools, just not the ones they want. And one out of three respondents says the tools the company provides are outdated.&rdquo;</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.k2.com/files/9531\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Other complaints  </a> </u>  are that IT is too busy to help or has too arduous a process.</p><h3> Consequently, an increasing number of corporations are starting to bite the bullet and allow BYOA.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Seventy-six percent of IT workers recognize they&rsquo;re delivering outdated enterprise tools that aren&rsquo;t meeting employees&rsquo; needs,&rdquo; Kaneshige writes. As a result, more than half of IT workers expect employees to use apps and devices unapproved by IT, he adds.</p><p> Similarly, another survey found that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/byoa-influence-underscores-need-to-redefine-smb-application-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   81 percent of small- to medium-sized businesses  </a> </u>  already implement BYOA, writes Heather Clancy in ZDNet. (Another interesting tidbit from that survey? While IT departments expected users to be running an average of 2.8 apps each, the  <a href=\"http://searchcloudapplications.techtarget.com/feature/Everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-BYOC-BYOA-movement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  r  <u>   eal figure is more on the order of 28  </u> </a> .)</p><p> In fact, BYOA has become as important as BYOD in the development of a comprehensive mobile strategy, writes Gartner Research Vice President Ian Finley.</p><p> So if BYOA saves the company money and makes employees happier and more productive, what&rsquo;s the problem? As with the similar issue of  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/me-and-my-shadow-dealing-parallel-it-organizations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   shadow IT  </a> </u> , security. That&rsquo;s particularly true because some of the main apps that employees like to BYO are personal cloud applications that allow them to save project files and take them offsite to work on later.</p><p> While that&rsquo;s a laudable goal, it has two primary risks. First, corporate data could get stolen. Second, if the data gets changed, then you end up with multiple versions with no clear way to reconcile them. In addition, if you&rsquo;re in a highly regulated industry, you could run afoul of various data security requirements.</p><p> In fact, another survey found that 46 percent of senior IT professionals believe data is leaking from their companies due to unmanaged file sharing products, Kaneshige writes.</p><h3> The solution?</h3><p> <br/> Focus on protecting the data and ways to securely manage your company&rsquo;s content, not what device or application is being used to access it. For example, you might allow users to gain access to corporate data from their own devices and apps, but not copy or alter it using policies you can set with enterprise content management software.</p><p> When you officially implement BYOA (because chances are your employees implemented it months ago), make sure users tell you what apps they&rsquo;re using. Obviously, this is so you can research the app and be aware of any security risks it might pose. But there&rsquo;s more to it: Apps that one user finds valuable may be useful to other employees as well.</p><p> And if it turns out that most people in a department or even in the whole company are using a particular app, maybe it behooves IT to start supporting that app on a company-wide basis. Similarly, if it turns out that nearly everyone is using an off-the-rack messaging app, but they&rsquo;re using all different ones, perhaps it would be helpful to standardize on a single one, or at least a single one per department.</p><p> Clancy cites one example of a company concerned about the cloud storage applications being used by the sales team to share documents and presentations. Rather than banning those services, the company settled on the most appropriate one for its needs and migrated employees to that option, which could be secured and managed more easily than the others, she writes.</p><p> In addition, you may find that your corporate  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-things-you-should-do-to-manage-byoa/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   infrastructure needs beefing up  </a> </u>  to support the wave of devices and apps that are going to start using it, writes Conner Forrest in TechRepublic. &ldquo;Pay special mind to the network utilization and bandwidth consumption of apps that are brought in,&rdquo; he advises.</p><p> <strong>  And take heart. With the proper precautions, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that BYOA will drive you to BYOB. </strong></p><p>  </p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 18:28:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 18:28:26.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_rpt5m4o.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/next-step-for-smartphone-users-byoa/\", \"post_id\": \"6379\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 18:28:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 18:28:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"next-step-for-smartphone-users-byoa\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6378\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2928\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-28-at-11.40.57-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"741\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443523500,"author_id":308,"chart_url":""}

The research indicates that <strong>  retirees spend the largest chunks of their time sleeping and watching TV. </strong> Which leads the authors to suggest that since these activities are not income draining, retirees may not need to worry about living beyond their resources.</p><p> Whoa&mdash;let&rsquo;s stop the car right here. Does that mean that the warnings from every financial institution&mdash;from commercials to glossy brochures&mdash;are misleading? That the books warning about the looming disasters for those nearing retirement are false? The answer is a clear maybe. </p><p> <strong>  The substance of the study does point to a retirement of inactivity and inertia. And yet some of the reasons for that may well include: </strong></p><li> Unless directed, very few people take the time to map out a retirement strategy.</li><li> There is a lack of qualified professionals to help consumers make good decisions.</li><li> People who lack training and knowledge avoid trying to look into the future because they lack the tools to properly evaluate options and opportunities. <br/>  </li><p> Of course, there may be a variety of other factors, but these three seem to jump to the front of the line. People don&rsquo;t plan for their most preferred futures because they don&rsquo;t know how to, can&rsquo;t find or are unable to afford qualified professionals or lack the perspective to think objectively into their futures.</p><p> <strong>  To avoid their fate, you want to develop a higher level of awareness and the willingness to get out of your own head. Here are a few ideas to think about: </strong></p><li> You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know. Therefore, getting objective advice is critical. Your life in retirement should reflect your values and what you care most about in your life. Sorry, but reruns of Hogan&rsquo;s Heroes are not a substitute for living a life that is full and rich.</li><li> Your money mindset&mdash;how you see money&mdash;impacts your ability to make decisions, big and small. If you are a money avoider or a worrier, you will tend towards doing nothing, especially without sufficient information to push you out of worry.</li><li> You do not need rafts of money to live a meaningful life. Many retirees find great satisfaction from a variety of activities that are not couch related, such as volunteering and mentoring, taking classes or attending lectures, walking tours, exploring local sites and attractions, joining an organization to increase community and finding ways to be active physically and mentally.</li><li> It takes a designed level of separation to think beyond your life today. Give yourself the time and space to imagine your life beyond your present routine. Having a guide/coach/planner to help you prepare can be very helpful. <br/>  </li><p> Objectivity is perhaps the key to this discussion because we all believe that we know what we know and are comfortable with our beliefs. We don&rsquo;t see ourselves as others see us. We have a sculpture of ourselves that we have created from our earliest years that tells us how smart we are, how good-looking we are, how successful we are&mdash;all constructed to maintain our feeling of self-worth and self-esteem.</p><p> Breaking that structure works against our ego, but deep down, in our heart of hearts, we know that our knowledge is limited. We know we aren&rsquo;t going toe to toe with our favorite movie icon or multi-multi-multi billionaire.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not to say that without billions and movie star looks we are less than&hellip;in fact, the acknowledgement that we aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;all that&rdquo; in every area of life is a pretty good indication that we&rsquo;re in touch with reality.</p><p> Regardless of your current age, if sitting in front a TV and sleeping presents a satisfying picture of life&mdash;then no need to focus on the future. But <strong>  if your life in retirement holds an image of something more active, engaged and interesting, it&rsquo;s never too early to begin to consider the possibilities and the financial price tag to fulfill those dreams. </strong></p><p> Here&rsquo;s to happy dreams!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 19:00:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 19:00:40.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Pb4qOEE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/sleeping-and-tv-how-retirees-spend-their-time/\", \"post_id\": \"6381\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 19:00:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 19:00:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"sleeping-and-tv-how-retirees-spend-their-time\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6380\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2929\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/old-tv-1260x840.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"883\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443529800,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2853,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why We Need a New Audience to Discuss Gender Equality in the Tech Industry","link":"why-we-need-a-new-audience-to-discuss-gender-equality-in-the-tech-industry","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Facebook engineers Erin Summers and Zainab Ghadiyali created </strong> &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wogrammer.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wogrammer  </a> </u> &rsquo;, a portmandu of &lsquo;woman&rsquo; and &lsquo;programmer&rsquo; to publicise women in technical roles. The movement,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.techinsider.io/sheryl-sandberg-is-trying-to-get-the-new-term-wogrammers-to-catch-on-2015-8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   described by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg  </a> </u>  to &lsquo;break stereotypes by highlighting women's technical accomplishments, not just their gender&rsquo;, could be seen as an anticrisis to tackle male-dominated Silicon Valley. Media attention towards technical women has grown with the introduction of startup culture but still remains largely unaddressed outside of the space. This year&rsquo;s UCAS applications saw  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240238710/Men-tighten-grip-on-computer-science-degrees-reveals-UCAS-figures\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   85% of computer science/engineering places awarded to male students  </a> </u> , suggesting many female students see technical courses the reserve of male classmates. DJ Alice Levine&rsquo;s BBC series &lsquo; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2015/37/girls-can-code\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Girls Can Code  </u>  &rsquo; </a>  presented five young women from different backgrounds but united in their limited experience with technology. The programme emphasised that it remains common for technical roles to be perceived the domain of men. One participant expressed concern that a lack of intelligence would prevent her from exploring a career in tech and unfortunately, the majority of the group were of the same opinion. As a digital marketer working on the periphery of tech, I have a strong awareness of systems and programming languages. When you are surrounded by technical colleagues it is easy to forget that writing code is still not considered the norm outside of the sphere. A substantial amount of my male friends are developers but I do not have a single female friend within the role. I fear the women in the BBC programme are speaking for the masses, with many believing technical positions are harder than they actually are to break into.</p><p> The &lsquo; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/women-technology-inequality-10-years-female\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   women in tech  </u>  &rsquo; </a>  movement has been successful in highlighting female role models within the tech space. It is now widely acknowledged (and celebrated) that women are present in the technical teams of some of the world&rsquo;s most influential companies; however, the majority of messages do not filtrate outside of the industry. This barrier does little to erode socio-gender stereotypes and resistance to traditionally male roles. Programming is quickly becoming a must-have for the next generation and we will see an increase in technical equality as a result of coding in schools and initiatives such as Barclays&rsquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.barclays.co.uk/DigitalEagles/BarclaysCodePlayground/P1242686640999\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Code Playground  </a> </u> . Technical skills are being promoted to both sexes at a young age, enabling all students to view a career in tech as obtainable. As equality within the tech space is further publicised, the gap between the sexes will begin to close naturally.</p><p> Whilst awareness of equality is paramount, the &lsquo;Wogrammer&rsquo; movement appears to offer a gendered solution for a gender issue. I think we are at the point where women within the tech space are largely accepted and respected. If the industry is not there already, we are incredibly close to acknowledging that technical people can take the form of women or men. We should be amplifying the message of gender equality to the external world instead of analysing the ratio of the sexes to individuals already within the space. We should be encouraging talented individuals to further push technological development, regardless of gender. The ratio of men versus women should be irrelevant if both sexes are given the same visibility to the educational and vocational opportunities within the industry. When we are educating the sexes equally and hiring for talent, that is when we have solved the gender issue. Consciously employing women programmers in attempt to &lsquo;balance the figures&rsquo; is as much a prejudice as rejecting a developer on gender.</p><p> &lsquo;Wogrammer&rsquo; is just one of many a tech portmandu populating vocabulary in recent months. According to Google, a &lsquo;brogrammer&rsquo; is a seemingly frat-like developer who thrives on jagerbombs and banter. Reference to the term often alludes to the &lsquo;brogrammer&rsquo; as a sexist, beer ponging jock who occasionally partakes in a midweek hackathon. Highlighting the importance of sex with prefix &lsquo;bro&rsquo; or &lsquo;wo&rsquo;, projects the importance of gender within the industry. The &lsquo;wogrammer&rsquo; programme has great intentions and the creators have a real point with what they are looking to highlight but I personally believe it would have been more effective as a gender-inclusive movement. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zainab-ghadiyali/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Zainab Ghadiyali  </u> </a>  was quoted in a Huffington Post article asking: &lsquo;Would anyone mention a male CEO's family or hobbies in an article about his company?&rsquo; Whilst I understand the point Ghadiyali is making, lifestyle articles are a highly effective way to showcase technical careers. As readers, we also have to think about the context of an article, the publication it is featured within and what the audience is looking for.  </p><p> It would be short sighted to overlook the presence of lifestyle pieces in men&rsquo;s magazines, often within the same style as those targeted towards a female demographic. Vogue magazine&rsquo;s December 2014 article &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/4537369/pinterest-tracy-chou-silicon-valley/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How Pintrest engineer Tracey Chou is breaking the Silicon Valley ceiling  </a> </u> &rsquo; explored the shortfall of female engineers within a lifestyle piece. For the magazine&rsquo;s readership, the inclusion of technology was well suited. If Chou had&rsquo;ve been interviewed for Tech Insider, I would have expected a different tone and slant on the story but she was being interviewed for Vogue, one of the world&rsquo;s most respected fashion and lifestyle publications. The article had a focus on Chou&rsquo;s profession as an engineer for social platform Pintrest but unsurprisingly had reference to fashion and lifestyle. Vogue&rsquo;s demographic is well-educated women and the majority will be familiar with the idea of a software developer but without extensive knowledge on the subject. We need to remember that people buy publications like Vogue because they are looking for lifestyle entertainment. Vogue magazine is a fantastic publication to be spreading the inclusion of both sexes within the tech industry. Unfortunately, we seem to be caught up in a cycle where professional women are having to act androgynous to be respected. Why are we facilitating a society with such dated and sexist expectations? If both sexes are celebrated for skill (regardless of preference for feminine/ androgynous hobbies or appearance) we will have a talented workforce and inclusive society.</p><p> To facilitate an inclusive society we need to encourage individuals  pursuing both &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; and &lsquo;non-traditional&rsquo; lifestyles. Whilst gender-neutral existence is rightly accepted, we should not be ostracizing individuals enjoying &lsquo;gender-traditional&rsquo; activities. We should not be condemning a successful woman for being interested in fashion or beauty any more than we would a man. As an individual I am a female interested in all things digital, I have a great interest in programming and am always learning how to further develop the areas I know. I am also a fashion girl; I grew up reading glossy magazines and streaming videos of fashion week. I am an oxymoron of gender preferences. Vogue magazine was right to include Chou&rsquo;s hobbies within their segment in the same style as any other career featured. Chou is an embodiment of a professional women who can achieve highly, a message we should certainly be amplifying to the masses.</p><p> <strong>  It seems an increasing number of women are condemning others for their choice of lifestyle and unfortunately, it is often far harder for women to fight against their own gender. </strong> Only when we embrace an inclusive attitude will everyone be credited on skill and the gender divide close.

{"original_id":2854,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Integrating Social Security Into Retirement Portfolios","link":"integrating-social-security-into-retirement-portfolios","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Social security is arguably among the richest and robust pension programs ever created. </strong> In it's current structure, social security provides federally guaranteed lifetime benefits for individuals, spouses, divorced spouses, widows/widowers, disabled individuals, minor children as well as child-in-care benefits.  Furthermore, since social security also provides cost of living adjustments, all these benefits are also protected from the ravages of inflation which may otherwise potentially cripple the purchasing power of retirees during what could amount to a 20-30 year retirement period. <br/> <br/> So where does this enormously valuable \"financial asset\" fit in the analysis of one's investment portfolio? Well that is a much debated topic indeed among financial planners. Some simply exclude social security entirely, treating it as an outside source of income and adopting asset allocation strategies that do not take it into account at all. <br/> <br/> Others, however, treat social security like a bond investment given the fact that it provides regular (not to mention federally guaranteed) income the same way that fixed income securities do. Likewise, social security is also unaffected by the vagaries of the stock market. <br/> <br/> In fact, you may be surprised to learn that none other than Vanguard Group founder Jack Bogle, who's company has $3 Trillion in assets under management, has argued in favor of treating social security like a bond investment for purposes of allocating the rest of your portfolio. He argues that you can take on more risk in buying stocks with the remainder of your savings if you know that social security will offer you the monthly income that you would otherwise need to get from bonds. <br/> <br/> Some, if not many, would consider that to be an aggressive view and would likely be unwilling to give up their other fixed income assets to rely entirely on social security. However, for those who desire an increase in the expected return from their investment portfolio, having social security benefits as a backstop may give them the confidence to be more aggressive in their investing strategy. <br/> <br/> So what's the answer? What does your own investment professional recommend or has he/she even addressed this issue with you in the past? <br/> <br/> Well, like most things regarding social security, the \"best\" solution depends on a number of factors and there is no easy answer.  The key for all financial advisors to consider is that social security is often the largest single retirement asset in most people's portfolios. It typically accounts for 30-60% of an individual's retirement income. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Today, there is a growing number of financial advisors who are becoming experts in integrating social security into retirement planning. </strong>  Rather than treating social security as a stock or a bond, these specialists treat it as it's own \"asset class\", one that's similar to a fixed income asset, and develop sophisticated social security integration strategies. Since it has it's own unique risk, income and taxation characteristics you would be wise to consult your team of financial professionals  and ask if they have experience with these strategies.  It would also be important to consult with a social security income maximization specialist in order to determine the optimal social security filing strategy for your individual situation. <br/> <br/> By utilizing all this information, in conjunction with the expertise of financial professionals, you can more confidently approach retirement knowing you have a comprehensive retirement plan <br/>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 19:21:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 19:21:58.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_oznAvgv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/integrating-social-security-into-retirement-portfolios/\", \"post_id\": \"6385\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 19:21:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 19:21:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"integrating-social-security-into-retirement-portfolios\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6384\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2931\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443385276351-4d8f58059a23.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"570\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443528000,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

Instead, I started listening to a caller who said she was homeless but had a college degree and some certifications, with bookkeeping and administrative skills, recent work experience, and so on. She sounded sharp&mdash;spry, even. The morning personalities (\"Heidi and Frank\") asked the caller how in the world she had become homeless.

It turns out being homeless but college-educated is in no way uncommon, although people still treat it as a freak situation (which it's not). The Washington Post not long ago ran  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/the-homeless-man-who-graduated-from-harvard-law-school-with-chief-justice-john-roberts/2015/07/13/63257b5c-20ca-11e5-bf41-c23f5d3face1_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a story about a Harvard-educated lawyer who is homeless  </a> </u> . It's the sort of story that goes viral because it's so unexpected. But it's only unexpected because so many people are so ill-informed about homelessness. Also, we have a strong need to believe our cherished myths about education being the key to a better life blah blah BLAH BLAH. When reality collides with that sort of myth, the myth, oddly enough, tends to win. <br/> <br/> In Los Angeles County, where I live now,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.laalmanac.com/social/so14.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   about 82,000 people are homeless on any given night; 32% are college graduates  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> Nationwide,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/11/17/college_kids_homeless_nightmare_inside_a_little_known_horrifying_crisis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   56,000 college students are homeless  </a> </u> .  <br/> <br/> Also: In L.A., 18% of homeless men and women are veterans of the armed forces. <br/> <br/> But: The homeless don't work, right? <br/> <br/> Wrong.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-28-at-12.24.27-PM-2.png\" width=\"709\"/></p><p> According to a 2002 national study by the Urban Institute, about 45% of homeless adults had worked in the past 30 days. (That's only about 15% less than the population as a whole.) The idea that homeless people are, as a group, generally unemployed or without an income is false. Many work full-time. Some have disability checks. My wife is one of those. She's not homeless, but her $705 monthly check from Social Security isn't enough to pay rent. (Kafka side-note: She's been turned down, in the past, for low-income housing. Not enough income.) <br/> <br/> We tell ourselves all kinds of myths to avoid having to understand homelessness in any kind of detail, because it's just too frightening a subject. One of the most popular myths is that homeless people are, by and large, either drug addicts or mentally ill, or both. That's pretty far from accurate. In L.A.,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.laalmanac.com/social/so14.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   only about 20% of homeless are mentally ill  </a> </u> . Substance abuse is harder to quantify (since it's based mostly on self-reporting), but the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/addiction.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estimated, in 2003  </a> </u> , that 38% of homeless people were alcohol-dependent and 26% abused other drugs. That's a lot, but it's not 100%, or even 50%. <br/> <br/> Another myth that's comforting (somehow)&mdash;because it keeps us from having to think any further&mdash;is that many homeless people choose homelessness. <br/> <br/> We have a strong, primal need to cling to our feel-good beliefs. If someone is poor, it's obviously because they chose that. That's the predominant myth sold in America. If you're not a millionaire, it's because you didn't choose it; you chose to be the loser you are.  <br/> <br/> Not getting that dream job? It's because you made these 10 common mistakes in your resume. <br/> <br/> Not getting traffic to your website? It's because you didn't follow these 5 surefire headline-writing techniques. <br/> <br/> Not getting the man of your dreams? You didn't read last month's Cosmo. <br/> <br/> Not successful beyond your wildest dreams? You didn't follow the law of attraction. <br/> <br/> That's it. That's it in a nutshell. <br/> <br/>  </p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 19:29:50.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 19:29:50.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_OjiYQgc.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/were-all-homeless-on-the-inside/\", \"post_id\": \"6390\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 19:29:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 19:29:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"were-all-homeless-on-the-inside\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6386\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2932\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-28-at-12.35.31-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1273\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443546000,"author_id":263,"chart_url":""}

Social Media is flooded with it.  Traditional media is flooded with it.  It&rsquo;s become our modus operandi as a culture.  If you post a good rant, you&rsquo;re rewarded with thousands of likes and followers, ratings go up, so ranting has become the cool thing to do.  I&rsquo;ve even read articles about blog-writing that say &ldquo;ranting&rdquo; is something you  should  do as a writer.</p><p> Oh, how I&rsquo;ve loved a good rant in my day!  When I was younger there wasn&rsquo;t a fight I wouldn&rsquo;t enter.  I would say whatever showed up in my brain.  I thought I was smart (I suspect there were people out there who might have described me differently back then).</p><p> We try to dress it up by calling it &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo;, but let&rsquo;s get real &ndash; there&rsquo;s no dialogue going on.  It&rsquo;s all &ldquo;I&rsquo;m-right-and-your-wrong-so-there!&rdquo;.   A dialogue insinuates that there&rsquo;s turn-taking, and listening going on.  Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not saying that a good intellectual debate doesn&rsquo;t make things better, but if we get so mired in making others wrong that we can no longer hear one another, aren&rsquo;t we just talking to ourselves?  And if we&rsquo;re already convinced we&rsquo;re right, what&rsquo;s the point?</p><p> <strong>  A good debate makes things better, but if we&rsquo;re so mired in making others wrong that we can&rsquo;t hear, aren&rsquo;t we just talking to ourselves?  </strong></p><p> And the finger-pointing is as pervasive in our organizations as it is in our politics.  I hear it all the time.  Managers blaming their direct reports.  Sales blaming Marketing.  Marketing blaming Operations.  We blame our bosses.  We blame our colleagues.  We blame our vendors.  We blame the culture.  We even blame our customers!</p><p> It&rsquo;s so great!  We don&rsquo;t have to take responsibility for anything, because everything is always somebody else&rsquo;s fault!</p><p> Except&hellip;.(you knew this was coming, didn&rsquo;t you?)</p><p> Maybe that&rsquo;s not entirely true.</p><p> I remember when my kiddo was about&hellip;five year old, and he would be talking about being scared of &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; &ndash; because every book we&rsquo;d read, every movie, every cartoon, practically  everything  was about some good guy overcoming some bad guy.  There&rsquo;s always got to be a protagonist and an antagonist.  A hero and a villain.  And I&rsquo;d gently explain to him that there aren&rsquo;t really that many bad guys in the world.  There are some, and we do need to be careful, but that there&rsquo;s far more good people out there than bad.</p><p> And I believe that to be true.  In my core I do.</p><p> When I was growing up, the Russians were the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;.  Now I have many dear friends who are Russian.  Really  caring, good, amazing  people.  I&rsquo;ve lived in some of the most conservative places in the United States and some of the most liberal places, and I&rsquo;ve learned that there are  caring, good, amazing  people who believe very different things.</p><p> One thing I&rsquo;ve learned is that we see what we look for in life.  If we want to see how wrong and evil someone is &ndash; we&rsquo;ll see it.  We&rsquo;ll hang out with others who see it too.  Who agree with us and tell us how right we are to be so astute as to see how wrong and evil &ldquo;those people&rdquo; really are.  Whether &ldquo;those people&rdquo; are from a different country, have a different skin color, worship differently, love differently, vote differently.  Whether &ldquo;those people&rdquo; happen to be individual contributors or management.  Rich or poor.  We love the &ldquo;us against them&rdquo; theme &ndash; we&rsquo;re tribal by nature.  It&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re wired.</p><p> <strong>  We see what we look for in life.  If we look for bad &ndash; we&rsquo;ll see it.  If we look for good &ndash; we&rsquo;ll see it.  Which is a better way to see? </strong></p><p> I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday who has a &ldquo;turn-around-guy&rdquo; working with her organization, stirring up all kinds of craziness.  He&rsquo;s calling out all the sacred cows, honing in on all the inefficiencies, and questioning the way things have been done for decades.  And for the first week, all people could do was point fingers at him and blame the &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; for the big feelings he was stirring up.  People were angry and scared.  They didn&rsquo;t feel safe.  My friend, who had been through his process before with another company, was empathetically breaking into cold sweats in anticipation of his arrival, as she knew what was about to hit the fan.  But she also knew that the work he did was transformational.  Because she had seen that transformation in herself years before.  And as emotions erupted and people were filing grievances and threatening to quit, my friend, ever the calming influence, encouraged people to give it time.  To listen and absorb.  To trust the process.  And slowly, people are beginning to see that maybe, just maybe there is something that they could learn.</p><p> As she was sharing this story with me, she said, &ldquo;You know, it hurts to look at yourself and see what you might be doing that is adding to the problem.&rdquo;</p><p> She&rsquo;s so wise, my friend.  It does hurt.  No wonder I don&rsquo;t like to do it.  None of us do.</p><p> <strong>  It hurts to look at yourself and see what you might be doing that is adding to the problem. </strong></p><p> Look, I&rsquo;m not saying that there aren&rsquo;t problems out there &ndash; big ones.  But where&rsquo;s it getting us, all this finger-pointing?  Nowhere.</p><p> Is it possible for a brief moment to put down our shields and instead of pointing the blame, ask ourselves simply, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s my part?&rdquo;   Because we all play a role.  Or as my friend Mike Cook likes to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in this soup together&rdquo;.

Forever. Gone. Don&rsquo;t count on another dime of mine in the market.&rdquo; Ryan isn&rsquo;t alone. A surprising 74% of Millennials surveyed said they do not own stocks. And that&rsquo;s unfortunate for Ryan and his fellow GenY-ers.Ryan&rsquo;s letter is worth a read &ndash; and he&rsquo;s makes a couple of good points &ndash; but he&rsquo;s also misses a very important point: none of this should really matter to a Millennial.Here&rsquo;s why. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure countless little guys had their stocks absolutely steamrolled this morning only to see the big guys scoop up the shares on a discount.&rdquo;   There is obviously a  <strong>  wide range of ways to experience the market: </strong>  as a small investor, as a large investor, and as a robot.  Are other people going to do better than you sometimes? Sure. They&rsquo;re also going to do better than you at sudoko, finding parking spaces, and &ndash; unfortunately in my case &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/3-winning-strategies-investing-and-fantasy-football-share/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fantasy Football  </a> </u>  as well. But that shouldn&rsquo;t matter to you, and shouldn&rsquo;t keep you from investing in your own financial independence.The stock market is volatile and, sure, some investors may make impressive bets while others experience much too impressive losses (all investing involves risk, including the risk of the loss of principal.) But, historically, the S&amp;P 500 averaged a 7-8% return (after inflation)* each year and that&rsquo;s value you&rsquo;re missing out on if you&rsquo;re not invested.  &ldquo;The only &ldquo;people&rdquo; who can react to those pricing distortions in real time are computers. This isn&rsquo;t a place for small time people like me.&rdquo;  <strong>  Nothing beats human guidance </strong>  and judgment to prevent panic selling or override a previous decision when a drop in a price is anomalous and not due to a fundamental loss in value. Having a plan and sticking to it is usually the best approach and there are great Financial Advisors ready to help you or sharing their insight on the web. &ldquo;The only reasonable thing that any little guy can do is sit back and say, &ldquo;Wow there is a lot of distortion going on and I can&rsquo;t even guess at these prices.&rdquo; <strong>  Investing shouldn&rsquo;t be guesswork </strong>  and doesn&rsquo;t have to be. A good financial advisor &ndash; or your own research &ndash; can help you select a diversified group of financial instruments tailored to your own financial goals and risk tolerance. With that in place, along with a well-thought-out plan for steady saving and investing, market price fluctuations should not disrupt your plan.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/ryans-open-letter-to-cnbc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   If you&rsquo;ve got a solid financial plan  </a> </u> , investing in the stock market does not affect your ability to pay your rent, take care of yourself or your family, or add to that rainy day emergency fund.I hope you reconsider, Ryan.As Millennials, we&rsquo;re in it for the long haul, we have years of disciplined savings ahead of us with interest that will continue to compound if we avoid reacting emotionally to the markets.Once the uneasiness of August 24th has worn off (and much of that day&rsquo;s paper losses have already been recovered,) I hope you and the millions of Millennials who are not yet investing, take advantage of the opportunity to invest while you are young, to maximize your options for reaching your own financial goals, whatever they may be.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 19:41:52.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 19:41:52.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_X588if3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/my-response-to-a-millennials-open-letter-to-cnbc/\", \"post_id\": \"6394\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 19:41:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 19:41:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"my-response-to-a-millennials-open-letter-to-cnbc\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6393\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2934\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Dipping-Toes1-885x480.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"674\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443526200,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

Don&rsquo;t collaborate with others. Don&rsquo;t help others. Don&rsquo;t look out for others. Don&rsquo;t cooperate with others to accomplish mutual goals. Only and always monopolize conversations with talk about yourself, your work, your accomplishments and your needs. Take up all the space and energy in the room when you walk in. Allow no space for others to shine or be celebrated.</li><li> <strong>  Stop learning &hellip; </strong>  If you want mediocrity, don&rsquo;t seek to improve your knowledge and skills. Avoid studying the breadth and depth of your knowledge. Do not attend conferences or seminars. Do not read blogs or books. Do not leverage new technology. Do not get more education and certification. And do not network or volunteer.</li><li> <strong>  Measure nothing &hellip; </strong>  If you want mediocrity, do not identify or track the metrics necessary for success. Do not monitor trends. Do not analyze data and try to predict what&rsquo;s going to happen or what should happen next. Do not use this information to set goals for growth or improvement. And definitely don&rsquo;t evaluate or give feedback on how people are doing at their jobs or what they can do to help themselves or the organization get better &hellip; see #1 and #4 <br/>  </li><p> This list probably sounds ridiculous to you &hellip; It should.

{"original_id":2859,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Benefits Of “Google My Business\" To The Financial Advisor","link":"the-benefits-of-google-my-business-to-the-financial-advisor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google My Business  </a> </u>  is a great way to connect your business to web users looking for your service. In a previous post, I explained just exactly  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-google-my-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what Google My Business  </a> </u>  is all about. Here are 3 key reasons why you shouldn&rsquo;t wait any longer to get your practice on Google My Business.</p><h3> Reason #1: Produce Better Search Result Information</h3><p> <br/> When you list your business on Google My Business, it gives Google more awareness of who you are, what you do, and most importantly, where you are located. Here&rsquo;s an example of what you can expect your search result to look like when not using this Google service. In this example, I did a search for &ldquo;beaufort planning&rdquo;.</p><p> <img alt=\"Search results with no Google My Places listing\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-11.06.52-PM.png\"/></p><p> Ok, so what, right? It produced search results and if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;The Beaufort Group&rdquo; you&rsquo;re doing a happy dance since you&rsquo;re listed at the top. But what about the information it provides to the user? There&rsquo;s a link, some preview text describing the firm and the website address to their website. Is this useful?</p><p> Now, here&rsquo;s another example search I did on &ldquo;veriday&rdquo;.</p><p> <img alt=\"Enhanced search results using Veriday\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Veriday-Search-Results.png\"/></p><p> With this example, there are 3 distinct visual enhancements between the first and second example provided by simply getting listed on Google My Business.</p><li> The Address information (i.e. where it reads 5450 Explorer Dr., etc.) This is inserted below the description of the website on the left hand side. Google is pulling this information directly out of Veriday&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Business&rdquo; listing.</li><li> Interactive map. Google will automatically create this map on your behalf using the address information you&rsquo;ve provided. This provides your potential audience with relevant location information about your business. Additionally, Google will also grab images from your profile and drop it into this search result which is a great way to present your brand to the user without requiring them to visit your website.</li><li> Listing information about Veriday. This will vary from company to company depending on the amount of information provided. Everything from the address, to hours of operation, phone number and in some cases, the latest post in Google+ will display.  You can also have customer reviews show up. All of this is customizable.</li><p> Note: There is a 4th visual difference but that one isn&rsquo;t directly influenced by having a Google My Business listing.  I&rsquo;ll be sure to cover this in another post.</p><p> So, what makes the result in example 2 more useful than example 1? Simple, location information and contact information are the most common pieces of content that users are looking for when searching a business both on their desktop and mobile devices. By presenting this information instantly to the user, it saves them the time they would otherwise spend looking for that information on the website. In the &ldquo;beaufort planning&rdquo; example, I would need to hit Beaufort&rsquo;s website to find more information.</p><h3> Reason #2: Enhanced Mobile Search Experience</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s plenty of data that points to the reasons why delivering a mobile experience is important for users. Luckily, Google has already taken this into account. Creating a Google My Business listing helps you deliver an integrated experience across smartphone, tablet and desktop. The best part is that you don&rsquo;t need to know a single line of code to do that. Notice how the exact same example produces a very similar experience when I perform the search on my smartphone. The location and contact information is present first in the case of &ldquo;veriday&rdquo;, where a Google My Business listing exists.</p><img alt=\"Beaufort Planning mobile search\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image.png\"/><img alt=\"Veriday Mobile search results\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image-1.png\"/><p> Note the 3 links that Google provides:</p><li> A &ldquo;Call&rdquo; link. When users click on this link, it provides a single click to call function.</li><li> A &ldquo;Directions&rdquo; link. Clicking on this link will bring up the mobile version of Google Maps and provide the driving directions to (in this example) Veriday from my current location.</li><li> A direct link to Veriday&rsquo;s website in case I&rsquo;m not looking for telephone or address information. This is even more of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/google-launches-mobile-friendly-label-mobile-searchers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   justification to have a mobile website  </a> </u>  since you want to maintain a consistent mobile experience for your visitors. <br/>  </li><h3> Reason #3: It&rsquo;s Free</h3><p> <br/> Yep. How about that. Google provides this service to advisor practices and businesses for free. What&rsquo;s the catch? Well, it really is all about data, and the accuracy of data. In particular, location based data. The data that drives 1 in 3 searches performed online on Google (not including Google Maps). Google has always been about delivering simple and useful user experiences, hence why their search results don&rsquo;t have a lot of bells and whistles. Here&rsquo;s one last thought. If Google believes that the accuracy of location based data is an important part of search, is it safe to assume that if you have a business name similar to another business (who may or may not be a competitors) in the same geographic area and only one of you have a Google My Business listing, that Google will list you higher in search results? Looking back at Example 1 of my desktop search, where &ldquo;Beaufort Group&rdquo; appeared higher than &ldquo;Beaufort Planning&rdquo;, imagine the result if &ldquo;Beaufort Planning&rdquo; had a Google My Business listing. How do you think that would change?</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-28 19:55:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-28 19:55:56.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_bCCJjiw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-benefits-of-google-my-business-to-the-financial-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"6398\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-28 19:55:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-28 19:55:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-benefits-of-google-my-business-to-the-financial-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6397\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2936\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Google-Dublin-Campus-36.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"813\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443542400,"author_id":30,"chart_url":""}

Take position out of the equation and build great relationships and teams. Mix the generations. The only difference between your Millennial employees and the older ones is their digital proficiency. They don&rsquo;t know anything different.</p><p> To Millennials, it&rsquo;s normal to use mobile and social technologies. Where else would you go to access data, find out the latest ideas and trends, build networks, and share experiences.</p><p> Fundamentally, generations never change. They are born with inherent behaviors. A person&rsquo;s natural instinctive behaviors are hard-wired into the brain based on genetics and their very early life experiences in the first 3 years of life. Research shows the neural pathways in the brain become substantially set by the time a person is 3 years old, and this is when their natural instinctive style is set. Of course, a person&rsquo;s behavior in particular circumstances may change or be adapted based on experiences, education, values, and circumstances. However, such temporary behavioral shifts will be based on situational modification and are not hard-wired.</p><p> The generations are not so different:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Business-blog2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Business blog2\" src=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Business-blog2.png\"/> </a></p><h3> The Millennials are no different to any other grouping.</h3><p> <br/> If you want to attract them, focus on getting to know them and understanding what drives their decision-making. The vehicle they use to do business is inevitably going to change, but the essence of who they are and how they want to be treated will be no different from any other group.</p><p> Says TIME writer, Joel Stein, &ldquo;millennials are just adapting quickly to a world undergoing rapid technological change they&rsquo;re optimistic, they&rsquo;re confident, and they&rsquo;re pragmatic at a time when it can be difficult just to get by.&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://cheapscholar.org/2014/04/11/millennial-backlash-challenges-new-generation/#sthash.iP49drFe.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Source  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t shy away from hiring Millennials. Don&rsquo;t be persuaded by negative press. </strong></p><li> Some are positive and confident and know they can take on the world.</li><li> Others seek structure and look to leadership to provide a clear vision.</li><li> Still more want to be taken seriously and have a chance to share their thoughts and ideas.</li><li> Many want to be part of a team, but many others prefer to work alone. <br/>  </li><p> How, I wonder, is that so very different from past and present work environments in which we see ourselves? Well, the truth is, it isn&rsquo;t. The key is to reveal and understand inherent hard-wired behaviors. This insight will deliver a fundamental shift in thinking and enable organizations to focus on the relationship management across generations. In addition, this approach will deliver understanding into how businesses can &ldquo;know, engage and grow&rdquo; their clients and customers to provide customized life-long experiences that increase sustainable performance.</p><p> Millennials represent the first wave of digital natives to enter the workforce, and this does distinguish them. Organizations that have embarked on their own transformation urgently need this digital capital. They should eagerly look for ways to embrace Millennials and create the work environments where top talent can flourish across all generations. This will require nuanced strategies that reflect the reality of a multigenerational workforce: employees of all ages are complex individuals working in an environment that&rsquo;s becoming more virtual, more diverse and more volatile by the day.

{"original_id":2862,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The NFL - An “Untacklable\" Brand","link":"the-nfl-an-untacklable-brand","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tenetpartners\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Brad Puckey  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://tenetpartners.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tenet Partners  </u> </a></p><p> Is there really such thing as an &ldquo;untacklable&rdquo; or unstoppable brand? After two decades as a brand consultant, my gut reaction is, &ldquo;of course not, any brand can meet its demise through mismanagement, malfeasance and a host of other activities whether in or out of control of the leadership&rdquo;.</p><h3> Although, not so fast...</h3><p> <br/> It seems as though the NFL&rsquo;s offseason (or in season for that matter) is beset with ever growing scandal each year. From a commissioner who is perceived as anti-labor to domestic abuse, animal cruelty, drug abuse and more by players. Organizations who hold their municipalities&rsquo; hostage in negotiations for facilities. Teams accused of outright cheating, which many thought would be the death sentence for the league, challenging the very integrity of the game.</p><p> All of that said, anyone who thought that the NFL would suffer any financial impact from any of this, clearly has never set foot in an NFL venue on game day. The fans, the truest example of fanatics, will not be deterred. Full disclosure, I am a big fan of the NFL, in particular the Pittsburgh Steelers (who have had their own issues), but nonetheless I am fascinated by the resiliency of this brand which has faltered so grandly and on such a public stage yet is immune to any financial repercussions.</p><p> <strong>  The cause of this could be the very structure of this brand. It really is a composition of many brands, the league itself and its 32 teams. </strong> It&rsquo;s this structure that allows fans to adopt an attitude that, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my team vs. the NFL, the other teams&rdquo;. It allows people to rationalize their passion for the team and absolve themselves of any guilt. It&rsquo;s a case where fans can say, &ldquo;the league has its problems, I&rsquo;m just glad that isn&rsquo;t what my team stands for&rdquo;. For example, are Tom Brady and the Patriots cheaters, does Ray Rice deserve a second chance or should he be scorned forever because of domestic abuse and the gruesome images that we saw on that video. The NFL has made commercials to address the fact that domestic violence is wrong, but shouldn&rsquo;t that just be common sense? In spite of this and other episodes of domestic violence,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-09-26/the-nfl-is-growing-only-because-of-female-fans\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the female fan base continues to grow  </a> </u> . What about Adrian Peterson? Michael Vick? Civic pride and passion for your team allows people to overlook the shortcomings of their favorite team.</p><p> As a Steelers fan, it has been interesting to watch the reaction to Michael Vick as he&rsquo;s been welcomed to the team. While he was not brought to Pittsburgh without some rumblings, some of the fans that screamed the loudest when he was first reinstated to the league aren&rsquo;t screaming so loud these days.</p><p> <strong>  In the final analysis of the success of the league, TV ratings, which lead to the all mighty dollar, none of this appears to matter. </strong> Ratings for the NFL kickoff game on NBC just keep getting stronger,  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCSportsPR/status/642329565554151424\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   up 5% from last year and 9% from the year before that  </a> </u> . I think ultimately, the NFL is about competition, story lines, passion and drama. Far from damaging the brand, I think these things make it grow. It has been ingrained in our society, the Super Bowl is a national holiday. It may not be &ldquo;unsinkable&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the crisis that would derail the NFL. I&rsquo;m not making a value judgement on whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or a bad thing, I&rsquo;ll leave that up to the individual to judge, it&rsquo;s just the reality of it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 17:53:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 17:53:35.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_MDm519t.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-nfl-an-untacklable-brand/\", \"post_id\": \"6404\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 17:53:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 17:53:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-nfl-an-untacklable-brand\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6403\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2942\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-29-at-10.56.47-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"787\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443636000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2863,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Artificial Intelligence: The Rise Of The Humans?","link":"artificial-intelligence-the-rise-of-the-humans","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I recently enjoyed the series of TV programmes on Sky News and the BBC profiling developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. But while the subject has always fascinated me, what really struck me was the underlying theme of fear that pervaded both programmes: the fear of what advances in AI might mean for the job security and the future of humans. There seems to be a war-like philosophy &ndash; if we develop them, they will overtake us, putting our very existence in danger. Robots will take over the world, and we will lose control.</p><h3> Personalising processes</h3><p> <br/> Discussions and research about the use of robots can be dated back to the first millennium, but the conversation today is indeed a world away from the musings of days gone by. Whereas we used to think robots' potential was limited to repeatedly performing the same process-based tasks (typically on factory floors), we are now creating machines that can replicate a human&rsquo;s ability to think, making decisions independently based on patterns, past performance and logic.</p><p> This phenomenon is a subset of AI known as machine learning. Whereas the robots we think of on those factory floors are programmed to perform, machine learning was defined by pioneer Arthur Samuel as \"a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\".</p><h3> The robot in our pocket</h3><p> <br/> Although the process has progressed slower than many anticipated, the concept of machine learning is now steadily infiltrating our lives, and millions benefit from it daily. Google Search, used daily by around 300 million people, uses machine learning. Every time a term is searched and a link clicked on, Google's search engine learns from the user&rsquo;s behaviour. It then hones what is displayed in the search results on subsequent occasions. To do this, complex algorithms analyse multiple behaviours in a bid to create a more personal response for the individual.</p><p> On our mobile phones, too, we see AI in action. Intelligent personal assistants such as Siri and Cortana can take a stream of speech, interpret it and offer solutions by individualising responses and delegating to other applications to complete tasks. Our media consumption has similarly been transformed. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon and Apple all use machine learning to make recommendations to customers of films, programmes, albums and books they might like based on their own choices and those of other customers.</p><p> While these applications of AI have been widely accepted, other developments are causing more of a mixed reaction. Driverless cars are hitting the headlines and grabbing the attention of everyone. While advocates try to reassure people that removing human error can make driving safer, sceptics are terrified by the prospect of cars \"driving themselves\" around our cities and countryside. Can a car be programmed to act more safely than a driver would, to take into account the magnitude of variables including other humans' behaviour, weather and the environment? Science says yes, but this is a concept that many humans find difficult to accept.</p><h3> AI penetrating banking and telecoms</h3><p> <br/> In my own industry, financial services, machine learning has a multitude of applications, some of which are already well-established. One example is the use of complex machine-based algorithms during credit card transactions to predict the chances of a transaction being fraudulent. To do this, banks use a finely developed understanding of user behaviour patterns &ndash; saving millions in the process.</p><p> The appetite for using AI in financial services and telecoms has shown exponential growth in recent years, and shows no signs of slowing down as banks and mobile phone operators seek new ways to cut costs and maximise customer convenience.</p><li> Barclays has recently announced the use of IBM&rsquo;s Watson to provide services such as money transfers and &lsquo;rudimental tasks&rsquo;.</li><li> Nao, a 58cm tall robot, has been employed in the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi to perform reception-style duties to visitors, offering pre-recorded responses in a number of different languages, dealing with requests effectively and delighting customers as a result.</li><li> Pepper, &lsquo;the first humanoid robot designed to live with humans&rsquo;, can recognise emotions and tailor its actions accordingly. It is now greeting and interacting with customers at SoftBank Mobile, a large mobile phone operator in Japan.</li><p> <br/> We can laugh or wince, but all of these developments will iterate further. A rise of the machines is inevitable. Afraid?</p><h3> Fear not: imagine the freedom</h3><p> <br/> For many people, the prospect does not sit comfortably. Concerns range from the immediate to the apocalyptic. If machines take over all our jobs, how will we earn money? What if machines develop so much that they overthrow the human race, Terminator-style?</p><p> I cannot help but think this is an extremely short-sighted view. The reality of AI integrating our everyday lives in this way is hundreds of years away, and the landscape in this imagined future will be very different from the world we enjoy now.</p><p> So what if we turn the question on its head? If robots are going to be doing all the work for us, performing all the tasks that look after the economy and drive through innovation, what else could us humans be doing? Why do we fear a time where we are not tied to a computer screen or breaking our backs with manual labour, and instead have time to experience the wonders of the world we live in? Can anyone who owns a dishwasher really say that they miss the time they used to spend washing dishes? Do car owners long for a horse and cart to make the 30 mile commute to work every day?</p><p> Or maybe we could spend our time putting right the wrongs that our generation and the ones before it have made. It seems bizarre that in a time when our news headlines are full of the extremities of war and the impact this has on human life, as we sit in our offices reading about families fleeing for their lives and putting themselves in extreme danger because of the actions of other humans, that we fear our species&rsquo; risk is from mechanical devices rather than people. As a race we have the opportunity to nurture the growth of AI, such as a parent does with a child, to create a future where both can co-exist. If we get this right, our robots will enrich, rather than endanger, our lives.</p>  ","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 18:29:02.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 18:29:02.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_b5U7oeo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/artificial-intelligence-the-rise-of-the-humans/\", \"post_id\": \"6406\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 18:29:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 18:29:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"artificial-intelligence-the-rise-of-the-humans\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6405\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2943\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-29-at-11.28.43-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"846\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443632400,"author_id":129,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2864,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Decay of Brand Differentiation","link":"the-decay-of-brand-differentiation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There&rsquo;s a host of reasons why great brands decay. High on the list is weak marketing, weak management, and weak strategic discipline. I could add a dozen more. I won&rsquo;t. I will say that the crux of the matter is the incessant pressure on management to maintain or rediscover corporate growth.</p><p> The ramifications are pervasive, and particularly pronounced in the food industry where giants such as Kraft, Kellogg&rsquo;s, General Mills, and Campbell&rsquo;s Soup seek growth another way, a seemingly easier way &ndash; by digging into deep pockets to buy it. These companies have been merger and acquisition advocates for decades. Other than reducing costs and fattening stock prices, M &amp; A&rsquo;s have done nothing to strengthen the strategic health of the acquirer or the acquiree. Organic growth is near non-existent, and with the exception of the Kraft-Heinz merger, so is 5-year growth when acquisitions are included in the income statements.</p><h3> Leaders Failed to Nurture Their Brands</h3><p> <br/> Why the stagnation? Along the way, the leaders of these organizations turned their backs on the tenets of great branding, defined as carving out unique brand positions and adding to that strategic advantage with innovations that thrill customers. Rather than add to a brand&rsquo;s strategic advantage, they subtracted from its equity with tactical initiatives and superfluous line extensions.</p><p> Kellogg&rsquo;s Special K  used to be known as a healthy, nutritious breakfast for diet-conscious women. No longer. The recently launched sausage, egg &amp; cheese flatbread sandwich is 240 calories. That might be half the calories of McDonald&rsquo;s version, but it&rsquo;s still a packed combo of cholesterol, fat, and sodium and twice the calories of Special K cereal.</p><h3> Big Food Forgot How Create Organic Growth</h3><p> <br/> Beyond line-extending to non-strategic categories,  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/05/21/the-war-on-big-food/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Big Food  </a> </u>  failed to break their mindsets from the &lsquo;growth by acquisition&rsquo; paradigm. Maybe it&rsquo;s because the leaders of these enterprises didn&rsquo;t believe they could succeed the old fashioned way. After decades of absence from the innovation arena, their cultures are no longer conducive to strategic brand building. They&rsquo;ve forgotten how to innovate, they lack the patience to embark on the difficult task of reinventing a culture of innovation, and they can&rsquo;t escape their addiction to size and financial clout. This type of business leverage has been their back-pocket competitive advantage for more than half a century.</p><p> The decline of brand differentiation extends beyond Big Food.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.autonews.com/article/20150323/RETAIL07/303239975/porsche-dealers-profits-keep-piling-up\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Porsche  </a> </u>  is enjoying a vibrant auto market. Their German-made differentiator affords a high quality image, and for that, Porsche realizes higher operating margin ratios than do Mercedes Benz which produces a wide range of autos in 25 countries. German production is expensive. Should Porsche care? Not at all. With Mercedes giving up the German-produced asset, Porsche&rsquo;s &ldquo;made in Germany&rdquo; claim is stronger, facilitating premium pricing to Mercedes.</p><h3> VW Succumbs to the Lure of Slovakian Labor</h3><p> <br/> But now its owners,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/r-vw-keeps-profit-outlook-raises-sales-target-after-record-earnings-2015-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Volkswagen  </a> </u> , has succumbed to the profit opportunity afforded by lower non-domestic labor costs. In 2016, the  Cayenne  will be produced in Slovakia. Slovakia has a stellar reputation for auto manufacturing, but I&rsquo;m betting there isn&rsquo;t a Porsche customer out there who won&rsquo;t have a nagging question about quality in his or her mind. I&rsquo;m also betting that the  Cayenne  is the tip of the iceberg at Porsche.</p><p> So yes, the crux of the matter is the persistent pressure on management to drive corporate growth, but the Porsche example illustrates two additional factors at play.

{"original_id":2865,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Fundamentals of Business Coaching","link":"the-fundamentals-of-business-coaching","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There&rsquo;s both good news and bad news for small businesses operating in the United States. First, the bad news. Approximately 543,000 new businesses start each month; there are more businesses shutting down vs. starting. Seven out of ten new firms survive at least two years, however, only twenty percent will remain viable past the five year mark. The National Federation of Independent Business Education Foundation reports that over the lifetime of any business thirty percent will lose money.</p><p> Now, the good news. There are ways to help secure the longevity of small businesses in the marketplace. Large corporations are fortunate to have plenty of resources to address challenges, but that&rsquo;s not the case for small business owners. Enlisting the help of a business coach provides an avenue for small businesses to fill the void and flourish.</p><h3> What Is Coaching?</h3><p> <br/> Coaching is an intentional function where active interaction takes place with business owners and employees to identify and focus on what&rsquo;s important to accelerate your success.</p><p> Consider coaching as a management style rather than a tool. Integrating coaching into management systems helps align unique skill sets and competencies with overall business goals and objectives.</p><h3> The Value of Coaching</h3><p> <br/> Many businesses don&rsquo;t feel the need to hire a coach.  My response is, &ldquo;Would you expect any team to perform at its&rsquo; best without one?&rdquo; Suddenly, the perspective changes and many questions arise.</p><p> Business coaches support professionals who desire major and comprehensive improvements in all aspects of their firm. Collaboration with a coach encourages breakthroughs in change, helps manage evolution, and supports the implementation of desired outcomes.</p><h3> How Coaching Works</h3><p> <br/> Coaching provides awareness within a firm and identifies areas in need of attention.  Firms with limited structures block progress in reaching and exceeding current goals, establishing new goals, and obscures the ability to identify new trends within the industry.  Limited structures also lead to a disengaged workforce which discourages commitment and desire to contribute to the business. Coaching can foster a culture to encourage growth, awareness, responsibility, and development to remove stumbling blocks that prevent a firm from true success.</p><p> Through coaching, business owners soon realize they can improve performance and team motivation.   Most teams prefer a coaching-style management over the traditional command and control approach.</p><p> An effective coach will assess the big picture of your business plans, break them down into manageable milestones, and help you make modifications for positive and significant change by:</p><li> Assessing values, priorities, and goals</li><li> Designing focus goals</li><li> Collaborating with management and team members</li><li> Implementing a plan for change</li><li> Following up through accountability <br/>  </li><p> Integrating coaching into your management system provides an independent perspective of your business. The results are new awareness, clarity, and inspiration. Moreover, coaching identifies key values needed to create a winning team. Holding each member accountable for their contributions and roles in the firm will solidify a successful coaching plan.</p><p> <strong>  Some people say, I can&rsquo;t afford to hire a business coach.  I say, can you afford NOT to hire one? </strong></p><p>  &ldquo;A coach is someone who tells you what you don&rsquo;t want to hear, who has you see what you don&rsquo;t want to see, so you can be who you have always known you could be&rdquo; &ndash; Tom Landry</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 18:55:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 18:55:11.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_iejzadl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-fundamentals-of-business-coaching/\", \"post_id\": \"6410\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 18:55:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 18:55:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-fundamentals-of-business-coaching\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6409\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2945\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bow-tie-fashion-man-person-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"411\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443628800,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2867,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Running Your 401(K) Plan on Faulty Facts?","link":"are-you-running-your-401k-plan-on-faulty-facts","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Boeing recently became the latest victim of a 401(k) plan class action lawsuit. </strong> These lawsuits are becoming all too common. Many people believe or want to believe that the plans are being run by highly sophisticated and well-trained individuals. Let&rsquo;s examine what might have led to these lawsuits.</p><h3> Shifting risk from pensions to 401(k) plans</h3><p> There&rsquo;s been a recent move by many governments and municipalities to move away from offering teachers, firefighters, police etc. pensions and replacing them with 401(k) plans. The reasoning for the move is to decrease the cost and risk associated with running a defined benefit pension plan. Pensions require ongoing funding. Many governments such as the City of Chicago and State of Illinois did not properly fund their obligations early on realized that the makeup is contributions is overwhelming or near impossible. They looked for a way to get rid of that obligation and the 401(k) plan seemed to be the answer. It&rsquo;s been wrongly assumed that by switching to a defined contribution plan that all of the risk is transferred to the participants. While the risk for making ongoing contributions goes away, the risk of investment oversight increases. Poor investment returns on a pension plan mean that the plan sponsor has to kick in more dollars. In a defined contribution pension plan aka 401(k) plan, the risk shifts to investment and plan fee oversight. In the rush to get rid of the contribution risk or simply due to the overselling of the 401(k) plan, these new risks appear to be overlooked. Arguably the 401(k) plan increases complexity and the need for investment fiduciary literacy.</p><h3> 401(k) plan oversimplified and wishful thinking</h3><p> Believing that there is little risk to themselves, many fiduciaries leave it up to the service providers to run the show. Often investment committee meetings are simply rubber stamps for what the service providers recommend. In many cases there is no one sitting on the side of the company with formal training as an investment fiduciary. Most providers are not taking on fiduciary status and do not have investment fiduciary designations. A few of those designations include Accredited Investment Fiduciary&reg; or Professional Plan Consultant&trade;. These designees can provide practical investment fiduciary education. Investment committee members can also seek out their own designations too.</p><p> In order to make sure that the fees participants pay are reasonable, investment committees need comparison cost/service data. That comparison data could come from doing request for proposals. However, the RFP process is time consuming. Instead they could get that information from third party providers such as the Center for Fiduciary Studies. Alternatively, they can work with a retirement plan specialist that provides the data as part of their service.</p><p> Many company fiduciaries select providers based on brand awareness. They figure that their brand awareness and size must mean that they know what they are doing. However, what they know to do may have everything to do with that companies profit motive vs. the future of retirement of the plan participants. If they are not a fiduciary, they do NOT have to disclose conflicts of interest that might be inside of their plan recommendation. That&rsquo;s why you need a knowledgeable investment fiduciary on your company&rsquo;s side of the table.</p><h3> Testing your fiduciary knowledge</h3><p> How would you answer the following questions?</p><li> When was the last time you had fiduciary education?</li><li> Was the entity that provided the education accredited? For example, are they an Accredited Investment Fiduciary&reg;, Accredited Investment Fiduciary Analyst&reg; Or Professional Plan Consultant&trade;?</li><li> Have they acknowledged in writing that they are a fiduciary with respect to your plan? <br/>  </li><p> Unfortunately there are many people who call themselves financial adviser. There is no standard for what that means. Many believe that means someone who advises on investments. What you may consider advice, the &ldquo;financial advisor&rdquo; considers a recommendation. Legally there is a difference between advice and recommendation (investment advisor representative vs. registered representative). However, financial recommender doesn&rsquo;t sound quite as comforting.</p><p> Registered Representatives are brokering the transaction of buying and selling investments in your plan. They don&rsquo;t intend to offer &ldquo;advice&rdquo; from a legal standpoint. If they do, they are considered an investment fiduciary which they intend to avoid. Unfortunately some company fiduciaries only find out these differences after they are sued by either the Department of Labor or a plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney.

{"original_id":2868,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"From ETF Bootcamp to Morningstar ETF: Industry Has Eyes on What Makes a Successful ETF","link":"from-etf-bootcamp-to-morningstar-etf-industry-has-eyes-on-what-makes-a-successful-etf","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/lkatsanis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leah Katsanis  </a> </u></p><p> Last week, I attended the second annual  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etfbootcamp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ETF Boot Camp  </a> </u>  in New York City. The conference hosted the best and brightest in the ETF industry. Attendees included ETF start-ups, executives, media experts and index providers, among others. Also included in the bunch was our client, Kris Monaco, the head of ISE ETF Ventures.</p><p> The &ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; nomenclature wasn&rsquo;t used in vain. The conference compressed everything about ETFs from creation to launch to PR into a two-day event.</p><p> With over  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/23/etfs-the-2-trillion-industry-everyone-is-talking-about.html\" target=\"_blank\">   $2 trillion  </a> </u>  in assets and counting, competition in the ETF industry is fierce. The marketplace is in constant flux and ETF constituents need to evolve along with it to survive.</p><p> With that, we wanted to discuss a few of the top themes covered at the event, particularly from a media standpoint.</p><p> <strong>  Timing:  </strong> Time is of the essence, but not always.</p><p> Our client Kris Monaco said it right: &ldquo;Timing can make a product, or it can break a product.&rdquo; Oftentimes, ETF providers are sitting on launch-ready ETFs for months, waiting for the right timing. While you might be excited to push your ETF out the door as quickly as possible, before you do, take a step back and check out the happenings of the world scheduled over the next few months.</p><p> For example, if your fund&rsquo;s holdings are highly correlated to the real estate market, consider having your launch coincide with the next report issued on housing starts to make a bigger splash. Another option is to coordinate your fund&rsquo;s launch with well-known earning releases, if applicable. For instance, if Google is a top holding in your ETF, consider scheduling launch around Google&rsquo;s next release.</p><p> Keep in mind, however, that there is a fine line between &ldquo;news jacking&rdquo; (a term coined at GFCA for taking advantage of the day&rsquo;s news) and being first to market. Weigh the pros and cons with your team and resident PR gurus to decide the best time for blast off.</p><p> <strong>  Messaging: </strong>   Make your ETF part of the news stream.</p><p> Speaking of news jacking, this is something that we always advocate for our clients, and it was underscored at the conference as well. When it comes to the media, it is likely that your main objective is to get the word out about your ETF, as it should be. However, as counterintuitive as it may seem, you should not make the whole conversation about you or your fund. Rather, use creative messaging to loop your ETF into the conversation in other ways. For instance, instead of  always  talking about your ETF, discuss your ETF&rsquo;s holdings instead. If your segment is too self-serving, you could risk your invitation back.</p><p> Now more than ever, it&rsquo;s vitally important to understand the media ecosystem and where your ETF fits in. With social mediums making current news yesterday&rsquo;s news in milliseconds, ETF players need to understand how they fit into reporters&rsquo; agendas, and not how reporters fit into theirs.</p><p> <strong>  Broadcast:  </strong> Think of everything you learned as a kid, and do the opposite.  </p><p> Growing up, when you&rsquo;re on a sports team you&rsquo;re told to pass the ball to your teammates and be a team player, so to speak. Well, now is your chance to be the ball hog. Most times, when you&rsquo;re on air, TV spots span a couple of seconds at best. Try to keep hold of the conversation for as long as you can, with 25 seconds or so as your benchmark.</p><p> You&rsquo;re also told to be polite when you&rsquo;re a kid. Yes, of course, you must be cordial and professional on air. However, when you&rsquo;re speaking, make sure you get your time to shine. If you don&rsquo;t speak up, someone else will.</p><p> A few things you  should  take from your childhood? Be early &ndash; leave yourself time to check out the green room ahead of your appearance &ndash; be gracious, and be courteous. Appreciate what the anchors are going through; they have limited time to learn about all of the news of the day let alone the inner workings of your ETF. Make it as easy as you can for them. You want to be asked back, after all!</p><p> <strong>  Social Media: </strong>  Content is king!</p><p> The social media landscape is constantly changing, but at the end of the day, the one constant is content. Use social avenues as content distribution vehicles and use them regularly. When it comes to ETFs, one of the most important things constituents can do is educate their target markets; social is the new-age way to do so.</p><p> Just as important as content is presence. Today, as networks vet their guests, they are starting to factor in the number of Twitter followers they have. If you want to be a regular, start building up your following. Also, be sure to connect with the anchors and network before and after your appearance via social mediums to show your enthusiasm and thank them.</p><p> Lastly, when it comes to social, stay on trend. For instance, when all eyes are on the Fed, it might not make sense to discuss your ETF&rsquo;s rebalancing. Again, figure out ways to insert your ETF into the conversation and position yourself as a thought leader.</p><p> The ETF marketplace is evolving every day, but with change comes opportunity. Take advantage of the flux and be part of the movement!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 19:11:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 19:11:55.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_C9cidQD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/from-etf-bootcamp-to-morningstar-etf-industry-has-eyes-on-what-makes-a-successful-etf/\", \"post_id\": \"6416\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 19:11:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 19:11:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"from-etf-bootcamp-to-morningstar-etf-industry-has-eyes-on-what-makes-a-successful-etf\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6415\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2948\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CN_conraddestination_750x350_FitToBoxSmallDimension_Center.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"527\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443616200,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

It isn&rsquo;t quite time to retire yet, but for the first time (or maybe more), you can envision selling your business.</p><p> NOW is the time to plan ahead and take some steps to increase the value of what is most likely the largest asset you own. There are a handful of things that you can do today that will put more dollars in your pocket when you sell in five years that you won&rsquo;t be able to do if you wait until you get closer.</p><p> <strong>  1. Institutionalize the Management Team: </strong> Unless you would like to continue on with the business for a long period of time after a sale, put a management team in place that can take over the day to day responsibility for the business. If you are still running the day to day operations when you are ready to retire, to get any value for your business, you are going to need to stay for two or more years post-sale to transition the business to the new owner.</p><p> <strong>  2. Upgrade Your Financials: </strong> Make sure your company&rsquo;s financials are professionally done and in good shape. In order for a sale to occur, you&rsquo;ll need to be able to provide detailed financials that can tell the right story to the buyer. While internal financials may be ok to run your business, a buyer will want to see significant involvement by an outside accountant. Along these lines, think about getting your financials audited (or at least reviewed) the final year or two you intend to own your company.</p><p> <strong>  3. Talk to an Estate Planner: </strong> Make an appointment with an estate planning professional and explain your interest in exiting your business over time. There are a variety of tools you can put in place well before you sell that may allow for a lot of tax mitigation. These tools are harder to use as you get closer to a transaction.</p><p> <strong>  4. Remove Risk: </strong> While it may be difficult, try to remove as much risk as you can from the business as you get closer to the time you are looking to sell. Make sure important contracts, leases, and other important relationships get renewed for so that they extend for as long a time as possible downstream of a sale. Buyers hate risk &ndash; help them by removing it.</p><p> <strong>  5. Talk to an M&amp;A Adviser: </strong> Talk to a competent M&amp;A advisor TODAY. Many advisors are more than willing to create long term relationships with a potential client. Given their experience, a good advisor can potentially add a lot of value for you by helping analyze how to make your company more valuable at the time you want to sell. Often, these sorts of adjustments take time, and are much harder to make as the time of an actual sale gets closer.</p><p> Most of these items are things you can do relatively easily over five years, but are virtually impossible to do when a sale is imminent. But, many business owners miss out on a significant portion of value because they don&rsquo;t take the time to plan when they can.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 19:26:11.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 19:26:11.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_ZaIyQrp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-steps-to-retire-and-sell-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"6418\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 19:26:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 19:26:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-steps-to-retire-and-sell-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6417\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2950\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-29-at-12.27.41-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"816\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443614400,"author_id":345,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2870,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Unconscious Bias Thrives in Silicon Valley","link":"unconscious-bias-thrives-in-silicon-valley","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Silicon Valley is top-of-mind when it comes to great examples of the impacts and effects of bias in technology circles. The lack of women and minorities in key leadership roles at big tech companies begs the question of whether bias exists&mdash;conscious or otherwise. Many of these companies have published their diversity statistics (or lack thereof!); resultant media coverage has spurred some to make declarations to change.</p><p> Others, however, still don&rsquo;t seem to recognize how detrimental a lack of inclusivity may be. Such is the case for Microsoft, which has just been handed a lawsuit for gender discrimination. Recall that almost exactly a year ago,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inclusion-inc.com/blog/2014/10/16/208/its_time_for_women_to_stop_relying_on_karma/#.VgV7fflViko\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said women shouldn&rsquo;t push to advance their careers or ask for raises  </a> </u> . Instead, he suggested women sit and wait for karma to kick in and move their careers forward.</p><p> We&rsquo;re reminded of this advice in light of this recent lawsuit. In his Wall Street Journal article, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-accused-of-discriminating-against-women-in-lawsuit-1442436582\" target=\"_blank\">   Microsoft Accused of Discriminating Against Women in Lawsuit  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; Ezequiel Minaya reports, &ldquo;The lawsuit&mdash;filed by Katie Moussouris, who worked at Microsoft for seven years&mdash;accuses the software maker of paying women lower wages and promoting them less frequently, as compared with their male counterparts.&rdquo;</p><p> In greater detail, &ldquo;The lawsuit alleged that Ms. Moussouris routinely received lower performance ratings than male peers despite performing better.&rdquo; Additionally, the lawsuit &ldquo;accuses a male supervisor of retaliating against Ms. Moussouris by assigning her a low bonus after she accused him of sexually harassing women in her department.&rdquo; After looking deeper into the accusation, Microsoft learned that Moussouris was right, and that the supervisor had, indeed, sexually harassed female coworkers.</p><p> Is unconscious bias at work here? Does Nadella&rsquo;s suggestion that women not proactively pursue raises and promotions hint at a culture that may be pervasive at multiple levels within the organization? It would seem so. If it&rsquo;s true that Moussouris performed better than her male colleagues, yet earned a lower wage, certainly suggests some bias.</p><p> The need to address and correct unconscious bias isn&rsquo;t limited to Silicon Valley, but can be applied to all technology companies&mdash;in fact, all companies, large and small everywhere. As inclusive leaders, we need to set the example that any employee, regardless of background, needs to be accepted and included in the workplace, and rewarded equitably for their contributions. Failure to recognize and address unconscious biases at all levels of leadership could not only hinder your company&rsquo;s success, but could also lead to costly lawsuits.</p><p> The trouble with unconscious bias is that they&rsquo;re unconscious, or hidden! We have the resources to help inclusive leaders discuss unconscious biases with their teams. We can all learn from Microsoft&rsquo;s example.</p><p> Be inclusive!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 19:31:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 19:31:19.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_04g4vAN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/unconscious-bias-thrives-in-silicon-valley/\", \"post_id\": \"6420\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 19:31:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 19:31:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"unconscious-bias-thrives-in-silicon-valley\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6419\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2951\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5525029805b1f4e24074b6a8.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"931\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443640200,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2871,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Being Human: How to Lead People","link":"being-human-how-to-lead-people","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Your organization has sent you to leadership training and nurtured you through their fast track program. You know the disciplinary policy like the back of your hand and the you could recite state labor laws in your sleep. While these things are important to know and understand, the true foundation of effective leadership lies in inherent human qualities. In simple, great leadership boils down to being human.</p><h3> Be Honest</h3><p> <br/> Good leaders are honest with their employees, clients, and managers. They own their mistakes and oversights and actively work toward a solution. They don&rsquo;t say anything behind an employee&rsquo;s back that they haven&rsquo;t said to the employee&rsquo;s face. Their subordinates respect their honesty and trust their words. Sugar coating performance deficits causes confusion for the employee and fails to promote success. Be honest.</p><h3> Be Friendly</h3><p> <br/> Employees who connect with their leaders are more likely to respect and follow their leaders and feel satisfied in their role. Take time to learn about your employees&rsquo; families and hobbies; they make wonderful friendly talking points. A simple, &ldquo;Good morning, Shirley! How did Bob&rsquo;s appointment go yesterday?&rdquo; goes a long way. Always take a moment to establish eye contact and make a connection.</p><h3> Be Real</h3><p> <br/> Show your employees that you are a real person not so different from themselves. Laugh at work often and smile whenever you can. Let your employees into your life a little by sharing information about your family and hobbies. Leaders who are real with their employees are more approachable, and therefore receive more valuable feedback and suggestions.</p><h3> Be Supportive</h3><p> <br/> Good leaders are those who are supportive of their employee&rsquo;s ambitions and goals. Support each employee in their role, assist individuals in understanding the value of their contributions to the organization, and encourage every employee to pursue in-house positions that interest them. Take time to discuss an employee&rsquo;s career planning so you can work to keep the best in the organization. Identify leaders early and share your plans for their advancement in the organization.</p><h3> Be Empathetic</h3><p> <br/> Experience in the leadership industry can harden even the most compassionate of hearts. However, a leader should go to great lengths to see every employee as a human being, take every concern seriously, and genuinely empathize with the employee expressing his or her dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the effective leader shows empathy with the grieving employee and encourages as much family time as possible.</p><h3> Be Rewarding</h3><p> <br/> Statistics show that employee satisfaction increases more when non-monetary rather than monetary rewards are issued. Commit to complimenting a minimum of three employees daily on their performance. Telling the janitorial staff, &ldquo;It sure looks great in here! Thanks for the hard work!&rdquo; or your administrative assistant, &ldquo;Thanks for keeping such an organized schedule!&rdquo; takes mere moments but their effects are lasting.</p><h3> Be Open Minded</h3><p> <br/> Be willing to consider the viewpoints of others and entertain new ideas or suggestions. Good leaders understand the value in new and differing opinions. Furthermore, employees respect and value a leader who is open to their thoughts and opinions and who considers them seriously.</p><h3> Be Inspiring</h3><p> <br/> An effective leader shows employees what he or she expects of them by displaying the same commitment and drive every day.

Success is commonly the death knell of work/life balance.</p><p> Holidays become a time and place to fall in a heap before returning to face more dreaded success. A momentary break from the treadmill of growing client and staff expectations, more meetings, supplier issues and financial pressures.</p><p> At first, success may be rewarding. Your competitors, colleagues and clients will certainly be impressed but what is the purpose of all this activity? What are you working towards?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re after greater freedom, quality of life, enjoyment and control of your future, success may not deliver that.</p><p> Of course you could hire more staff but ironically that often leads to more headaches. They need management, training, direction, and quality communication due to every team member. The new less experienced naturally take longer and are not as proficient at the work than those delegating meaning they&rsquo;ll be quickly swamped by the activity wave without the desired &lsquo;release&rsquo; the new resources were hired to attend to.</p><p> What to do?</p><h3> You&rsquo;re too cheap&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Lift fees.</p><p> Lose more bids.</p><p> A conversation I recently had with an adviser inspired this blog.

Something is wrong here I think to myself.</p><p> (This adviser personally has about 80 clients. Her firm manages about 250.)</p><p> After gulping down her third cup of coffee of the morning, she ran off to another meeting with another one of her fly-in-fly-out clients, who she assured me was very happy with her service and advice.</p><p> My response was that she should be &ldquo;losing&rdquo; about a third of all new clients and about one fifth of all existing clients &ldquo;that she didn&rsquo;t want to lose&rdquo; every year because she can&rsquo;t be everything to everyone.</p><p> She didn&rsquo;t like that advice.</p><p> I wasn&rsquo;t trying to impress her but rather assess if we could work together to achieve a sustainable and funded success which is vastly different to the kind of success she is experiencing now.</p><p> In my position, I meet a lot of &lsquo;successful&rsquo; advisers but only a handful of successful business people.</p><p> Business is all about understanding priorities, sticking to the essentials and accepting you can&rsquo;t be all things to everyone.</p><p> After all, respect is far more important than popularity.</p><p> What do you reckon?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 19:40:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 19:40:57.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_MLn1QGz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/too-much-too-soon-when-success-becomes-a-curse/\", \"post_id\": \"6424\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 19:40:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 19:40:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"too-much-too-soon-when-success-becomes-a-curse\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6423\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2953\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443472933321-f2617633c81b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"610\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443612600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Among them, they lead&mdash;either politically or spiritually&mdash;nearly 4 billion people worldwide, more than half of everyone living on the planet right now.</p><p> <img alt=\"Shanghai Gold Exchange Withdrawals As Of August\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-09-25/COMM-chinese-president-xi-jinping-indian-prime-minister-narendra-modi-pope-francis-visted-US-09252015.jpg\"/></p><p> The effect of their visits cannot be overstated. I was attending an ETF conference in New York City, where the arrival of the populist Francis, hugely popular and revered among more than just Catholics for his humility and inclusiveness, brought the already-clogged city streets to a veritable standstill. So stacked were the cars and trucks as a result of Pope Mania that I was forced to cancel scheduled interviews on CNBC and Bloomberg. New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton said that the pontiff&rsquo;s arrival in the Big Apple during the United Nations General Assembly&mdash;when 90 percent of the world leaders were in the city at the same time&mdash;was the largest security challenge the department and city had ever faced.</p><p> I have immense respect for his Holy One. He embraces change, both within the Vatican and globally, and for the Jesuit tradition of education and ministry.</p><p> For many people, including me, Pope Francis is a thought-provoking figure. In his speech to the United Nations last week, he said that economic progress can be achieved through &ldquo;the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits by the state.&rdquo; I question his economic logic while admiring his caring heart and good intentions. Far-reaching progress can best be achieved through development, not redistribution. The secular proverb &ldquo;Give a man a fish and he&rsquo;ll eat for a day, but teach him to fish and he&rsquo;ll eat for a lifetime&rdquo; comes to my mind.</p><p> Certainly the pontiff&rsquo;s aspiration to feed the world is honorable, but the people who take the risk to plant the seeds and work hard to harvest the crops are not to blame for the hungers that exist. America is the most charitable nation on earth and our focus for increasing prosperity should be on helping people to fish and farm for a lifetime of financial independence.</p><p> Perhaps not as wildly anticipated, but no less important, were stateside visits from the heads of the second- and seventh-largest economies in the world, China and India.</p><h3> Mr. Xi: Trust Me, All&rsquo;s Well</h3><p> <br/> In his first stateside visit, President Xi Jinping addressed approximately 700 American businesspeople in Seattle last week, during which he, according to  <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/23/china-xi-jinping-seattle-speech-cyber-chinese-dream-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Foreign Policy magazine  </u>  , </a>  touched on &ldquo;the usual promises to stay the course on market reforms, the insistence of China&rsquo;s status as a developing country&rdquo; and &ldquo;the plea for mutual &lsquo;deep&rsquo; cultural understanding,&rdquo; among other promises.</p><p> Mr. Xi also reassured his audience to worry not about the Chinese stock market,  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinas-market-correction-in-three-easy-charts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   which I&rsquo;ve written frequently about  </u>  . </a>  He defended the intervention his government has made, arguing that the government has stabilized further deterioration and contained investor panic. </p><p> Likewise, he pledged to work with the U.S. to curb additional cybersecurity breaches such as the kind that struck Sony Pictures back in November 2014.</p><h3> American Business Leaders Expect Massive Growth in India</h3><p> <br/> Last week marked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s second visit to the U.S., the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/600-million-reasons-to-keep-your-eyes-on-india/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first time being in October 2014  </a> </u>  when he spoke at Madison Square Gardens in a rousing, rock-star reception.</p><p> As is the case with most politicians from whom much is expected, Modi&rsquo;s star has dulled somewhat since then. Many business leaders are starting to grow impatient about the slowness of his government&rsquo;s ability to eliminate investment hurdles.</p><p> But the promise he brings of a modern India, with electricity and Internet access for all 1.2 billion Indians, still remains more than just a dream.</p><p> U.S. business leaders seek to capitalize on this growth.</p><img alt=\"Janet Yellen Interest Rate Liftoff Delayed Again\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-09-25/COMM-facebook-users-India-100-million-active-monthly-accounts-more-than-US-09252015.jpg\"/><p> Let&rsquo;s be clear, though: India still has a lot of catching up to do. Morgan Stanley estimates that the country is at least seven years behind China when it comes to Internet penetration and online shopping. In 2014, India had about 243 million active Internet users, or about 19 percent of its population. In the same year, China had some 641 million users, or nearly half of its population, according to  <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Internet Live Stats  </u>  . </a></p><p> Quite contradictorily, though, Facebook users in India have  <a href=\"http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/with-over-100-million-users-india-has-a-larger-presence-on-facebook-than-usa-221401.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   skyrocketed to 100 million active monthly accounts  </u>  , </a>  which represent a larger presence on the social media platform than in the U.S, according to Tech2. This means there&rsquo;s huge upside indeed.</p><h3> Modi: Tech-in-Chief</h3><p> <br/> Narendra Modi is one of the most tech-savvy world leaders, a characteristic he wants to encourage his fellow Indians to embrace. He&rsquo;s a prolific user of Twitter, followed by a staggering 15.1 million people. By comparison, President Barack Obama&rsquo;s official presidential Twitter handle, @POTUS, has 4.38 million followers while @Pontifex, Pope Francis&rsquo; Twitter handle, has 7.35 million followers.</p><p> <img alt=\"Narendra Modi vs Pesident Obama Twitter account\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-09-25/COMM-narendra-modi-president-obama-twitter-09252015.jpg\"/></p><p> It&rsquo;s no wonder, then, that Modi sought an audience with top tech industry leaders such as Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk&mdash;some of the same figures Mr. Xi met with earlier in the week. All of them have expressed interest in diverting more resources to India, where the next huge surge in Internet usage is expected to take place. Retail giant Amazon, for instance, plans to spend $2 billion to expand its presence in India. Facebook will offer a free Internet service through its Internet.org platform.</p><p> In a YouTube video, Sundar Pichai, Google&rsquo;s current Product Chief and its next CEO, welcomed Modi on his visit to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/home-of-the-free-land-of-the-entrepreneur/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   immigrant-friendly Silicon Valley  </a> </u> . Born in India himself, Pichai highlighted the strong, longstanding partnership between Indian and America&rsquo;s major tech hub, stating: <br/> <br/> The bond between India and Silicon Valley is strong. India&rsquo;s long been an exporter or talented tech companies&hellip; The products by Indian graduates have helped revolutionize the world, but it is India that&rsquo;s now undergoing its own revolution&hellip; Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s digital India vision is central to the revolution. It focused on connecting the 1.2 billion people in India.</p><p> You can watch Pichai&rsquo;s full comments below.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fVwa78onlpk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-29-at-12.58.39-PM.png\" width=\"633\"/> </a> <br/> Click to watch.</p><p> In his personal tweets, Modi reassures followers that the goal of his visit is to strengthen business relations between the U.S. and India and to open his country up to further investment opportunities. This is a persistent challenge, as India is widely seen as one of the more difficult countries to conduct business in.</p><p> Modi has repeatedly pledged to speed up efforts to improve his country&rsquo;s business climate for foreign investors. <br/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-29-at-12.48.00-PM.png\" width=\"496\"/></p><p> In the picture above, you can see a seated Modi surrounded by powerful Fortune 500 executives such as Citigroup&rsquo;s Michael O&rsquo;Neill, PepsiCo&rsquo;s Indra Nooyi, IBM&rsquo;s Ginni Rometty, Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s Marilyn Hewson, Boeing&rsquo;s Bertrand-Marc Allen and many more.</p><p> During his visit, Modi approved a $3 billion deal with Boeing&mdash;which we own in both our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/all-american-equity-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   All American Equity Fund (GBTFX)  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/holmes-macro-trends-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Holmes Macro Trends Fund (MEGAX)  </a> </u> &mdash;a purchase that&rsquo;s eclipsed by Xi Jinping&rsquo;s plan to buy 300 Boeing jets worth $38 billion, not to mention an arrangement for an assembly plant to be built in China.</p><p> <img alt=\"Chinese President Xi Jinping just approved the purchase of $38 billion worth of Boeing jets.\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-09-25/COMM-Xi-Jinping-approved-purchase-38-billion-worth-boeing-jets-09252015.jpg\"/></p><p> In our  <a href=\"http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/mgssrewo/st/usfunds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   quarterly earnings webcast  </u>  , </a>  I mentioned the importance of staying abreast of government policy changes and the latest purchasing manager&rsquo;s index (PMI) numbers. While India&rsquo;s August PMI reading holds fairly steady at 52.3, indicating manufacturing expansion, China&rsquo;s still remains in contraction territory at 47.3.</p><p> Both government policy reform and PMIs help our investment team inform its strategies. Government policy, as led by the G20 countries, has unfortunately been focused largely on synchronized global taxation and regulation since 2008.

It is so small that the local gas station, which also happens to have a bar, is nicknamed &ldquo;the mall.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> This Main Street is where the community can find the bulk of the area&rsquo;s commerce: a body shop, plumber, bank, post office and honey processor. It&rsquo;s also where Rich and Tricia Millage have had their meat locker since 1999.</p><p> &ldquo;One company [who contacted us] asked the population of our town,&rdquo; Tricia said, &ldquo;and when I said 160 he promptly thought I meant 160,000. When I corrected him, he asked if we rode horses to work. I said we have horses, but we drive cars to work!&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s a world away from where Tricia was born and raised in Orange County, California. Rich was a Marine from the Midwest who was stationed at Camp Pendleton when they met. After Rich served in Desert Storm, he returned to California where the couple tried to make a go of it. But he &ldquo;just missed the Midwest and its way of life.&rdquo;</p><p> Rich had been laid off from a couple different jobs, but he had a background of butchering when he worked on a farm during his youth, so he picked up jobs around town doing meat processing. Tricia says Rich has a natural talent, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a job; it&rsquo;s a trade. You have to learn it.&rdquo;</p><p> In this space, the business originated as a grocery and general merchandise store. Another couple had transformed it into a locker in 1980. Nineteen years later, Tricia found out it was up for sale. Rich was laid off at the time when his wife decided to take out a small business loan and make the investment. &ldquo;He thought I had gone crazy,\" she recalls. \"I said, 'You have been laid off twice in six months, so I am buying you a job.'\"</p><p> Customers raise cattle and hogs in this rural farm community. They bring them into the Millages and they do the meat processing. Deer season (September through December) is a busy time because hunters have their venison processed here.</p><p> They create all kinds of cuts of meat from steaks to sausages. In addition to individuals who get custom orders, the Millages purchase federally inspected meat that they butcher for sales to the public.</p><h3> To say people come from miles around is no exaggeration.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;People have to go about nine miles to the grocery store,&rdquo; Tricia explains. For any other item that can&rsquo;t be found in town, it requires a 20-mile drive to Yankton, South Dakota.</p><p> Additionally, they have customers come from other states &ldquo;to buy good Nebraska beef.&rdquo; One customer who moved to Idaho made sure to buy a full beef before leaving. &ldquo;He came in with a trailer-load of brand new coolers and dry ice&hellip;we loaded it all up and away he went,&rdquo; Tricia explained.</p><p> In the northeast section of Nebraska, the weather isn&rsquo;t always easy. One year a snowstorm hit Fordyce particularly hard, preventing the Millages from getting into the center of town for three days. When the road was finally open, they arrived at the butcher block to find snow had drifted high in front of the doors to the building. There was a lot of snow to move and took a while just to dig into the locker to get to work.</p><p> Living and working in such a small town can be a blessing and a curse. &ldquo;We definitely know just about everyone and sometimes it&rsquo;s awesome, but sometimes it&rsquo;s invasive,&rdquo; Tricia says. And while it&rsquo;s far different than the Southern Californian atmosphere she was raised in, she still says, &ldquo;It is a beautiful place that we feel blessed to live in. We have loved raising our girls here. We are most thankful that this is where God set us!&rdquo;</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-29 20:13:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-29 20:13:57.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_lSWtaIa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/tr-butcher-block-fordyce-ne/\", \"post_id\": \"6432\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-29 20:13:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-29 20:13:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"tr-butcher-block-fordyce-ne\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6431\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2957\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-29-at-1.18.37-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1298\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443639600,"author_id":112,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2876,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Breaching the Psychological Contract Can Ruin Employee Engagement","link":"how-breaching-the-psychological-contract-can-ruin-employee-engagement","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Employee engagement is probably one of the most critical yet elusive factors in the workplace. It&rsquo;s hard to describe, but we certainly all know it when we feel it or see it. People go from totally pumped and engaged to seriously deflated and disengaged because of a breach of the psychological contract.</p><p> <strong>  A psychological contract is a person&rsquo;s belief about the mutual obligations that exist between an employer and an employee </strong> &mdash;some stated and tangible (like you give me pay and benefits and I&rsquo;ll give you work output, time and hours) and some unstated and intangible (like you will provide me with a positive work culture and opportunity and I&rsquo;ll give you commitment, loyalty and effort). This contract obviously evolves, both ways, as expectations develop and as we start melding into the culture.</p><h3> Disengagement often happens though when there is a breach of this contract.</h3><p> <br/> And these breaches, as I&rsquo;m sure some of us have experienced, come about for a variety of reasons like violations of trust, actions that reveal a lack of honesty and integrity, behaviors that violate ethics or the law, promises that get broken, assignments that intrude on personal time, job descriptions and expectations that are ill-defined, environments that are difficult and depressing, and leaders who drastically alter the deal.</p><p> These breaches that lead to disengagement are critical because research has consistently shown that disengagement can lead to a decline in productivity, performance, workplace safety, loyalty and retention, organizational citizenship behaviors, and overall, the bottom line. Some research has even found that contractual breaches influence different age groups differently. <strong>  Younger employees lose their sense of trust and commitment; older ones lose their sense of job satisfaction. </strong> Regardless of what it impacts, research has shown that when an employee is disengaged, their disengagement can negatively impact the team and ultimately, negatively impact customer engagement and retention.</p><p> The reason why this occurs is a phenomenon called Emotional Contagion, which is a very simple concept: if you smile and are positive around someone, they will feel good and most likely carry that positivity to the next place they go, which can create a ripple effect. It&rsquo;s pretty amazing when you realize how powerful a small positive gesture can be! The same ripple effect can of course occur when projecting negativity. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Take a moment and think about whether you feel good or bad around a positive person and/or negative person. It doesn&rsquo;t take a brain surgeon to figure this one out.</p><p> Sigal Barsade, a professor at Wharton Business School, studied emotional contagion and observed that <strong>  &ldquo;People are walking mood inductors, continuously influencing the moods and then the judgments and behaviors of others.&rdquo; </strong> In her research she has found that when participants are exposed to someone acting cheerfully in a group the group behaves more cheerfully. When participants were exposed to someone acting in an angry way, the group became angrier. Positive emotions created more cooperation; negative emotions increased conflict and decreased cooperative decision-making. The effect occurs in every type of organization, in every industry, and in every large and small work group.</p><p> This research confirms that disengagement, often caused by a breach in the psychological contract, can have incredibly significant unintended consequences. Often a broken psychological contract is left unrepaired, which only worsens the impact and consequences. Acknowledging the breach and making attempts to repair it is critical to regaining engagement and interrupting the effects of emotional contagion. It&rsquo;s a no brainer.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-30 18:00:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-30 18:00:23.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Fb4qR7i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-breaching-the-psychological-contract-can-ruin-employee-engagement/\", \"post_id\": \"6434\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-30 18:00:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-30 18:00:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-breaching-the-psychological-contract-can-ruin-employee-engagement\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6433\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2959\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-28-at-9.14.55-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"686\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443708000,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2880,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Suing For Slander: When Complaints Go Too Far","link":"suing-for-slander-when-complaints-go-too-far","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Chad Van Horn | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VHLawGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Van Horn Law Group  </u> </a> Most businesses have gotten a few negative comments here and there, either in-person or in writing. With the advent of Google&rsquo;s business listings, it&rsquo;s easy for unhappy customers to take their displeasure to the Web and make sure that everyone knows what a horrible experience they had&mdash;and that&rsquo;s completely within their rights, provided they actually had a poor experience.The problem comes when the commenter in question didn&rsquo;t actually have a poor experience and is going out of their way to make your business look bad. This is the point when a complaint has gone too far and moved into the territory of defamation. You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the concept of defamation already, if you&rsquo;ve ever heard of someone  <strong>  suing for slander </strong>  or libel, you already know the basics. Slander is spoken while libel is written, and both are public statements designed to damage the reputation of an individual or organization.The pros at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.physicianspractice.com/blog/suing-defamation-over-negative-online-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Physician&rsquo;s Practice  </a> </u>  give six points that your case needs to hit if you intend to sue for defamation:</p><li> The commenter has made a published statement that is either easily viewable by the public, or been delivered to at least one other person.</li><li> The published statement must be about you or your business.</li><li> The published statement must be false. By definition, the truth is never defamatory, no matter how negative.</li><li> The published statement is touted as fact rather than opinion. Insults and complaints of poor service referring to matters of opinion (such as a waitress&rsquo; hairstyle being seen as unkempt) are not considered defamation, although they may still be rude and hurtful.</li><li> The commenter made the statement with malice, meaning they&rsquo;re aware that the statement was false and made it anyway. Negligence is also valid for defamation, referring to a disregard of sensitive issues or information.</li><li> The actions of the commenter caused you or your business to suffer provable damages; this is by far the most difficult point to prove when it comes to online defamation. It&rsquo;s best to avail the help of a lawyer in order to assure this is proven clearly in court.</li>Ten years ago it may have been significantly more difficult to handle a defamation suit based on online comments, but today there&rsquo;s clear precedence for it&mdash;<u> <a href=\"http://www.eater.com/2014/2/5/6285361/yelper-found-guilty-of-defamation-for-scathing-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Eater reports </a></u> that in 2012, a Virginia woman posted a libelous review on Yelp and was brought to court on a $750 thousand lawsuit on the grounds of defamation. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning, however, that just because someone said something awful about your company doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can bite back. While the defendant in this case was found guilty, the complexities of the case led to the prosecutor also being found guilty of defamation.When it comes to protecting your business online, the first step is to be aware of your reputation. Monitor your reviews and research complaints thoroughly before jumping on a lawsuit. There are dishonest people out there, but sometimes a bad review is just a bad review.If you feel it's time to take the next step and get the guidance from an attorney, <u> Van Horn Law Group</u> has the resources and experience to help you.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-30 18:52:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-30 18:52:58.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_7V4r0TT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/suing-for-slander-when-complaints-go-too-far/\", \"post_id\": \"6442\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-30 18:52:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-30 18:52:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"suing-for-slander-when-complaints-go-too-far\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6441\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2963\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-11.54.57-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"607\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443721500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The favorite is always Barbara Boatrocker&ndash; &ldquo;her life feels like a sad country song, every little thing is wrong&rdquo;&ndash; for the appropriate audience I&rsquo;ll even sing that line ;-). &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always stirring the pot. Nothing&rsquo;s ever quite right when Barbara&rsquo;s around. She sucks the life-force out of your team.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Last week, when I asked what we should do about Barbara, the entire audience screamed out in unison, &ldquo;Fire her.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> I paused.</p><p> &ldquo;How many of you have a Barbara on your team?&rdquo; Again, almost 100% raised their hands, with lots of knowing laughter.</p><p> Clearly, it&rsquo;s not that easy to fire the &ldquo;Barbaras&rdquo; of the world, or this exchange wouldn&rsquo;t continue to work across all kinds of industries and cultures&ndash; even the top-notch law firm I spoke to recently hasn&rsquo;t cracked the code in their own organization.</p><h3> 5 Ways to Deal With Drama Queens and Chronic Complainers</h3><p> <br/> First let me emphasize the CHRONIC part of the syndrome I&rsquo;m talking about here. Open dialogue and employees expressing concern is not complaining. Seeking to understand is not resistance. I&rsquo;m talking about the handful of looney tunes you&rsquo;ll encounter in your career who consistently make matters worse.</p><h3> 1. Take it Off-Line</h3><p> What Barbara wants more than anything is an audience. Don&rsquo;t let her hijack your meeting. Acknowledge her concern and schedule some limited time to understand her concern privately (always good to have someone headed to your office right after). Trust me, your team will thank you.</p><h3> 2. Listen with an Open Mind</h3><p> Honestly, the reason these Barbaras are so annoying is that they have a point. Some of what they say is true, and you know it. But, you understand the bigger picture and the constraints. I must admit, I&rsquo;ve gotten some great insights from the Barbaras of the world. Pay attention enough so you don&rsquo;t miss the good stuff.</p><h3> 3. Give Them a Project</h3><p> I swear this works. Get them involved in solving the problem, not just talking about it. It&rsquo;s always easier to tear something down than to build something up. Pull her into the solution-building equation.</p><h3> 4. Watch Your Body Language and Facial Expressions</h3><p> Looking annoyed and ticked off will only reinforce her opinion that you&rsquo;re an idiot who doesn&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s easy to slip into passive aggressive mode here, to roll your eyes, or sigh deeply. Remember that Barbara is annoying, not stupid.</p><h3> 5. FIRE THEM</h3><p> Not for complaining, but for the other complicating factors. All that miss-spent energy normally comes at a productivity price. If Steps 1-4 still don&rsquo;t work (be sure you&rsquo;ve given them a chance), pay close attention to the side effects and document them.</p><p> <strong>  Your turn.

{"original_id":2882,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Winning Customer Loyalty with Empathy","link":"winning-customer-loyalty-with-empathy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CadeyBrooke\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brooke Cade  </a> </u></p><p> With social media taking over, it is no surprise to see more companies turning toward these digital platforms to connect with customers. Today, successful businesses are utilizing social media not only to build their brand and build strong relationships, but to foster customer relations and provide people with the best service.  <br/> <br/> One way that businesses are building those relationships is through empathy.  <strong>  Empathy </strong>  has been defined as  the practice of putting yourself into another person&rsquo;s thoughts, feelings, personality, and circumstances to better understand their desires . By taking time to walk in your customers' shoes, you will be able be more proactive in what you can do, what your services can do, and what the company can do in the long run to help them and serve their needs. <br/> <br/> <strong>  How can you use empathy to connect with customers?  </strong> <br/> Before you start putting together a marketing campaign around empathy, it is important to understand your customers. Take time to talk to them, gather feedback, and know what they are looking for and what they want/need. Hold a brainstorming session with your team, managers, and even stakeholders, to pull in as many ideas through an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inmoment.com/blog/understanding-empathy-brand/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   empathy map exercise  </a> </u> .  <br/> <br/> Throughout the exercise, you will be looking at four aspects of the customer experience: thinking, seeing, doing, and feeling. As you brainstorm about each of these sections, you will not only put yourself in your customers' shoes, but both you and your customers will see a greater ROI all around.  <br/> <br/> For your customers, as you take the time to actively listen and engage with them, they will feel like their voices are important and validated by your brand. In turn, you will create loyal, long lasting relationships with your customer base. In the end, everyone wins. <br/> <br/> <strong>  How have other businesses used empathy to build better relationships with their customers? </strong> <br/> Extra Space Storage recently released a video called,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p27Hi8QoHoo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   10 Things I Wish I'd Known Before Having a Baby  </a> </u> , where they connected with first-time parents in a touching video to help them navigate through the mounds of parenting advice they&rsquo;ll be getting. Extra Space Storage built a strong relationship with customers - both current and future - by sharing touching stories/tips from real parents.  <br/> <br/> Another excellent example is with Google Chrome, who created the video,  <u>  Dear Sophie </u> , to connect with dads. In their campaign, Google Chrome touched on those tender moments of fathers watching their children grow and wanting to preserve those moments in a unique way.  <br/> <br/> In both campaigns, Extra Space Storage and Google Chrome were able to connect with their customers, and potential customers, that went deeper than the product and services they offer.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  How can your brand build a deeper connection? </strong> <br/> Utilize the empathy map exercise with your team. Print out a copy for everyone, get a large white board, and get everyone to throw out their ideas in the brainstorming session. Ask open-ended questions such as, &ldquo;What are our customer&rsquo;s daily habits and rituals?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do they feel after using our product?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What are they doing to change their lives?&rdquo; and write down the answers. After the brainstorming session, take time to debrief as a group and create some actionable things you can do (on all levels) to make the customer experience better. <br/> <br/> You may have to go through this exercise a few times, but each time you practice this, you will gain better insights into your customers and what you can do for them. The important thing to remember is, at the end of the day, your customers need to feel like they&rsquo;ve been heard. <br/> <br/> Empathy is an excellent way to show them that they have been heard and you care about what they have to say.  <br/>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-30 19:01:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-30 19:01:39.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_0eIfrMY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/winning-customer-loyalty-with-empathy/\", \"post_id\": \"6446\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-30 19:01:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-30 19:01:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"winning-customer-loyalty-with-empathy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6445\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2965\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443610662308-74e383d24fbe-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"533\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443715200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The result was an overwhelming request from the employees for an on-site barbeque lunch.</p><p> The CEO has a manager coordinate the event. This manager understands the employees well and knows they will deeply appreciate this gesture if the CEO participates in the event. The manager suggests the CEO stand behind the grill, flipping burgers and hotdogs.</p><p> Near lunchtime on the day of the barbeque, the manager recommends the CEO get the grill area ready, as the manager alerts the rest of the executive team to start gathering their people. When the manager returns to the grill area, the coals are red-hot, and the CEO is nowhere to be found.</p><p> The manager chooses to jump in at the grill and starts cooking, much to the delight of the hungry employees.</p><p> After 30 minutes, employees are still waiting for the CEO to drop by and say a few words. The manager has tried to make the CEO look good by pinch-hitting at the grill, and it&rsquo;s become virtually impossible to overcome the lack of appreciation and respect the CEO has shown people who&rsquo;ve been busting their butts to weather the economic storm and make the company a success.</p><p> When the CEO makes an appearance just before the lunch hour has ended, he mingles a bit, heads straight for the food, grabs a plate and then returns to his office, barely saying a word.</p><p> What could be more important than connecting with the people who saved the CEO&rsquo;s profitability?</p><p> When such a leader walks around taking employees for granted, thinking, &ldquo;Let them try and get a job somewhere else!,&rdquo; the leader risks these valuable assets commitment and loyalty for the future. Getting another job today might be tough, but what about tomorrow when the economy may shift and employment opportunities are better?</p><p> If you act like this leader, your behavior is unacceptable, inappropriate, rude and disrespectful. In a tough economy, you may be correct; employees can&rsquo;t get jobs elsewhere easily. However, don&rsquo;t think for a moment this incident won&rsquo;t be among their top reasons to leave the company.</p><p> It&rsquo;s time for leaders to get their collective heads out of the sand and start walking the talk about &ldquo;team,&rdquo; &ldquo;acknowledgment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;appreciation.&rdquo;</p><p> My clients sometimes ask, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t employees have the same stake in the game?&rdquo; If you as a CEO or company leader wonder that as well, consider these questions:</p><li> Would working the grill have been that difficult?</li><li> How hard could it be to spend one hour connecting with people looking for some kind of acknowledgment from the boss?</li><li> Worse yet, because the CEO didn&rsquo;t show till the end and then not stay, their direct reports followed in-step. What the leader does gives license for direct reports to do the same. Is that the message you want to send? <br/>  </li><p> The above example makes it easy to understand why employees don&rsquo;t always give their all. When creating an &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; situation, it is difficult to set a standard for continued success. Moving forward, chances are the employees will be challenged to respond to the CEO&rsquo;s requests&mdash;not only because the CEO disrespected them, but because the CEO allowed the entire executive team to do the same.</p><p> It&rsquo;s simple: happy employees produce results and the CEO/President/Company Leader is the direct beneficiary in terms of productivity and profitability. Give your company a fighting chance. Show some corporate love and acknowledge your people. They are starving for leadership, and if you don&rsquo;t provide it, they will follow someone who will.

Sometimes life is awesome and feels as happy as a puppy chasing a tennis ball.</p><p> Other times, life is overwhelming and feels as scary as a tennis ball being chased by a puppy.</p><p> <strong>  I get it. Transitions happen. And sometimes they suck. </strong></p><p> Life changes. And slowly, but surely, we start to feel less like ourselves. We suddenly realize that things feel like they're beyond our control, too much to handle, or simply out of sorts.</p><p> Like many people, I am my harshest critic. Whether it&rsquo;s judging my work, my decisions, or my inability to solve a rubik&rsquo;s cube, I can find a way to add stress and overcomplicate any situation. And when that happens and I start to get off track...</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the exact formula I use to feel like myself:</p><h3> <strong>  5 Tips To Feel Like Yourself Again: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Decide how you want to feel.  </strong> This sounds obvious, but hear me out. If you don&rsquo;t like how you feel right now, do you know how you'd like to feel? Come up with 3-5 adjectives that describe how you want to feel at your best. Ex. Energized, abundant, light, creative, joyous, etc. </li><li> <strong>  Think Back. </strong>  Figure out the last time you felt that way (or close to it). What were you doing? Who were you with? What activities did you enjoy? What did your lifestyle look like (food, sleep, etc.)? Write it out. Seriously, don&rsquo;t just think about it. Actually write it out.</li><li> <strong>  Take Stock. </strong>  Look at all the actions you&rsquo;re currently taking (or not taking). How are they similar to or different than what you were doing when you were feeling great? Are you sleeping less? Drinking more? Spending time with the wrong people?</li><li> <strong>  Take care </strong> . Amp up the self-care. Go back to the basics and create a checklist of the daily behaviors that make you feel your best. Examples include meditation, exercise, drinking more water, making time for hobbies, etc. Adding in the good stuff will help to crowd out the crap.</li><li> <strong>  Simplify it. </strong>  Filter out that which doesn&rsquo;t serve you. If you&rsquo;re anything like me, this is a big one. It can be hard to filter out the things that prevent us from feeling like ourselves when we&rsquo;re caught up stressing over other people&rsquo;s reactions, our ideas of what we &ldquo;should&rdquo; be doing, FOMO, etc. So here&rsquo;s the key to keeping it simple: Create a filter question. Ask yourself, &ldquo;Will ______ (doing this thing, seeing this person, inhaling this Cinnabon) get me closer to or further from feeling like myself again?&rdquo; Then, act accordingly. <br/>  </li><p> Above all, release judgment. Transitions happen to all of us. And while the unknown often creates overwhelm and a return to old behaviors, we always have the ability to reroute our course and steer ourselves in the direction that serves us best. So, in the spirit of following my own advice, I&rsquo;m taking my dog to the park. Where I won&rsquo;t be the dog or the ball, but simply a happy observer.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-30 19:23:06.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-30 19:23:06.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_Rxm756m.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-tips-to-feel-like-yourself-again/\", \"post_id\": \"6452\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-30 19:23:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-30 19:23:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-tips-to-feel-like-yourself-again\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6451\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2968\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-10.04.14-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1077\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443726000,"author_id":22,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2885,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Worst Communication Mistakes Leaders Make","link":"the-worst-communication-mistakes-leaders-make","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Leadership in the business world always involves a human element. A manager armed with the best organizational skills, industry savvy, and a take-charge personality can&rsquo;t be a successful leader if they don&rsquo;t connect with their employees. Good communication makes connection possible, but there are endless ways to communicate poorly.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/06/the-top-complaints-from-employees-about-their-leaders\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u>  did a study that assessed communication issues preventing effective leadership. The top answers were:</p><li> Not recognizing employee achievements (63%)</li><li> Not giving clear directions (57%)</li><li> Not having time to meet with employees (52%)</li><li> Taking credit for others&rsquo; ideas (47%) <br/>  </li><p> While these pitfalls might seem obvious, it&rsquo;s easy to fall into them. Assessing your communication patterns for problem areas is a critical first step to improving those patterns.</p><h3> 1. Not enough recognition</h3><p> <br/> You should always offer praise for excellent work, but it&rsquo;s crucial to recognize specific contributions. Each employee brings their own strengths to the table, and they want to know that you notice those strengths. Can you identify what each of your employees contributes to their team that no one else does? \"Good job\" is great, but it feels hollow if it&rsquo;s not followed by more concrete praise.  Not only should recognition happen often, but it should also demonstrate the \"because\" behind it.</p><h3> 2. Unclear directions</h3><p> <br/> Establishing concrete expectations enables employees to perform well. If you have underperformers, ask yourself if misunderstandings could be part of the problem. Have you laid out exactly what they need to do in order to be successful and broken down all the criteria for measuring performance? In the effort to not micromanage or avoid the hassle of a long-winded explanation, it&rsquo;s easy to accidentally under-explain and just assume that they&rsquo;ll know what they need to do. However, this only hurts you in the long run; unclear directions breed frustration and poor performance.  </p><h3> 3. Too busy for employees</h3><p> <br/> Does one-on-one time with employees always have to be scheduled? Do you schedule those meetings only when a problem needs to be addressed? Do you frequently reschedule meetings with subordinates to attend to other demands of your job? If the answer to any of these questions is \"yes,\" you&rsquo;re showing your employees that you&rsquo;re too busy for them. In order to trust you, they need to know that they are worth your time. Take time to check in outside of one-on-one meetings, even if it&rsquo;s brief. Or if they reach out to you about an issue and you can&rsquo;t meet right away, follow up as soon as possible.</p><h3> 4. Claiming others&rsquo; ideas</h3><p> <br/> Employees want to be recognized for their contributions, to feel that their opinions and perspectives are heard. When discussing issues with them, do you tend to think that you have the right answer? When you pass on their feedback to your superiors, do you give them credit for their ideas? If employees don&rsquo;t think their contributions are given their proper due, they&rsquo;ll be much more hesitant to share ideas with you, much less trust you. </p><p> Good communication practices are essential to building rapport and trust with your employees. Since there are so many ways to communicate poorly, it&rsquo;s essential to test your own behaviors for weak spots. Do so and you&rsquo;ll already be on the road to better practices.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-30 19:24:40.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-30 19:24:40.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_IvoN6tJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-worst-communication-mistakes-leaders-make/\", \"post_id\": \"6454\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-30 19:24:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-30 19:24:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-worst-communication-mistakes-leaders-make\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6453\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2969\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443119663514-21b793f31fff-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"512\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443719700,"author_id":145,"chart_url":""}

Companies like Wealthfront are now managing assets north of $2B and reached these heights in just three years time. It's clear the confidence in startup financial services companies is growing.</p><p> If traditional investment firms want to compete and maintain their stong asset bases, they'll need to start integrating, acquiring, or building fintech capabilities into their current offerings. However, it's surprising to see &mdash; at this point &mdash; how far behind their services lag compared to what smaller fintech firms provide.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-30-at-2.00.22-PM.png\" width=\"559\"/></p><p> Since the launch of Etrade, traditional wealth management firms like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and even the more consumer friendly Fidelity and Schwab have been either too resistant or too slow to provide similar capabilities that disruptive startups have brought to consumers. Automated investment management&rsquo;s rise in popularity but stagnation in traditional companies is yet another example of what they could and should provide through digital.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been investing in the stock market since the pre-online trading days. I have used every firm from all the variations of Smith Barney &mdash; now integrated into Morgan Stanley &mdash; to Etrade and even the early social investing platform Covestor. Ultimately, I found most services&rsquo; best practices lagged behind what was possible in digital experience and capabilities.</p><p> More recently, I&rsquo;m using several fintech disruptors like SigFig (and its previous iteration, WikInvest) to get a better portfolio data visualization. And I have experimented with a new guard of automated investing tools like Betterment and Personal Capital for alternative approaches to investing.</p><p> So why the shift towards the disruptors and away from the old guard? Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p><h3> A Generational Change</h3><p> <br/> Events like the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Madoff investment scandal have shaken the confidence of baby boomers and Generation X investors in even the most stable wealth management firms. That means the most beautiful data visualization in the world won&rsquo;t inspire confidence if the track record is less than a decade long &mdash; and yet, investors do want these capabilities.</p><p> By the same token, it&rsquo;s not surprising that traditional stockbrokers may decry these services as big risks or only useful for small accounts. Many, though, are probably more concerned by the threat of transparency, low fees, and potentially better performance with less effort these automated services offer. It&rsquo;s equally unsurprising that some traditional management companies and their executives have relied on these excuses to avoid the need to transform their business model and provide similar digital capabilities.</p><p> However, as older generations entrust their wealth management to their children, the pressure on traditional management companies to provide these capabilities will continue to mount. Accustomed to more control, transparency, and digital visualization, Generation X and millennials will demand these features in their asset management. Coupled with the trend and acceptance of more passive or automated investment over manual custom portfolio management, more people will seek out the capabilities that the likes of SigFig, Betterment and Personal Capital provide.</p><h3> Steps in the Right Direction</h3><p> <br/> So I was excited the other day to receive an email from SigFig promoting their integration and capability to manage Fidelity accounts. This combines what is currently the best of both worlds: the security of having your assets at a stable financial institution with the cutting-edge data visualization and investment automation capabilities of a fintech startup.

When advisors are surveyed, they often say the quality of their wholesaler relationship is a key indicator of how much business they&rsquo;ll give to a particular fund company.</p><p> Similarly, reporters will be more receptive to story pitches from media relations reps if they have a strong relationship.</p><p> Reporters will be more receptive to story pitches from media relations reps if they have a strong relationship.</p><p> Not only that, but when there&rsquo;s negative news (or rumours) about a fund company or one of its people, the media will likely consult first with the company&rsquo;s media rep &ndash; to get more details and determine whether there&rsquo;s a legitimate story to proceed with &ndash; if they have a trusting relationship.</p><h3> Create a contact strategy</h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways to maintain relationships is to establish a contact schedule. If you&rsquo;re in fund sales, you know to rotate through your list of advisors. If they&rsquo;re great clients, you&rsquo;ll hold regular in-person meetings, maybe take them to lunch or some event. Other advisors get less-frequent meetings or even phone calls only, depending on their status with you.</p><p> Media relations folks should follow the same approach, giving more attention to the media outlets and reporters you work with most often (or value the most), and then tiering your contact schedule accordingly.</p><h3> Know what to sell</h3><p> <br/> Wholesalers recognize which funds are hot and why advisors need them for their clients&rsquo; portfolios. Competition is fierce, so if wholesalers can differentiate their investment solutions, they stand a better chance of winning an advisor&rsquo;s attention.</p><p> In media relations, you should know which portfolio managers or executives are in demand. As part of your media pitch, differentiate by showing why your spokesperson deserves to be interviewed and why readers will be attracted to this expert or topic of discussion.</p><p> Differentiate by showing why your spokesperson deserves to be interviewed and why readers will be attracted to this expert or topic of discussion.</p><h3> Stay relevant</h3><p> <br/> Since competition is heavy, a common wholesaler strategy to stay top of mind with advisors is to provide leave-behind materials and follow up to offer ideas on how to use a certain product in a client&rsquo;s portfolio.</p><p> On the media relations side, you can pique a reporter&rsquo;s interest by sending information about a notable portfolio manager or executive (i.e., your &ldquo;product&rdquo;).</p><p> To stay top of mind, give reporters compelling story ideas and potential angles they can take.

{"original_id":2888,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Top 10 Financial Goals for Gen Y and Considerations for Each","link":"top-10-financial-goals-for-gen-y-and-considerations-for-each","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Being in your 20s and 30s means experiencing many life milestones &mdash; and watching your peers go through the same. With all the exciting, new, and different things happening to you and your friends, it&rsquo;s easy to get swept up and not consider the financial impacts of setting and achieving major goals.</p><p> To prepare yourself and your budget, think about these top 10 financial goals for Gen Y, and what you&rsquo;ll need to consider when working to accomplish each one.</p><h3> Paying for a Wedding</h3><p> <br/> Whether you want a small wedding or a big one, weddings are deeply personal events that often go beyond just what the bride and groom want. For many people, weddings bring together family members across the country (or world) who haven&rsquo;t seen each other for years.</p><p> That said, weddings can be expensive. According to The Knot&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.theknot.com/2014/03/27/average-wedding-cost-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2014 Real Weddings Survey  </a> </u> , newlyweds shell out $31,000 on average for a ceremony and reception. While many parents still share the cost of weddings, younger generations increasingly choose to pay for the entire event themselves.</p><p> <u>  Setting a budget </u>  and not allowing anything to push you over it will go a long way to keeping costs down and retaining your sanity. Along with a budget, make a list of your priorities. Keep that list in mind so you can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to many of the extra other people say you &ldquo;should&rdquo; have.</p><h3> Expanding Your Family</h3><p> <br/> Kids are costly, but you can save now to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/13-money-tips-for-parents-to-be/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financially prepare for the arrival of a new baby  </a> </u> . Here are a few actions to take now:</p><li> Build a bigger emergency fund.</li><li> Make sure you have the  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/expecting-a-baby-do-this-insurance-review-first/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   right insurance with proper coverage  </a> </u> .</li><li> Carefully consider what you really need for a new baby, and pick up what you require secondhand or from family members.</li><p> And one last thing to consider: kids don&rsquo;t have to cost you a certain amount. How you choose to raise your family will have a big impact on your expenses.</p><h3> Buying a New Home</h3><p> <br/> A good rule of thumb before purchasing a new house is to save up at least  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/saving-down-payment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   20% for your down payment  </a> </u> . (That means if your ideal first home is in the $150,000 range, you&rsquo;ll want to try to save $30,000.)</p><p> Yes, 20% is a big sum. But there&rsquo;s a reason why it&rsquo;s helpful to try and hit this number. For one, you&rsquo;ll avoid PMI, or private mortgage insurance. This is an additional monthly fee on top of your mortgage payment. If you put down 20%, those mortgage payments will also be lower, and you&rsquo;ll likely secure a better interest rate from a lender.</p><p> If a new house is on your financial goals list, make sure that  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/5-rent-vs-own-considerations-for-gen-y/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purchasing a property really makes sense for you  </a> </u> . Do you plan to stay in one place for at least 5 years? Do you earn enough to not only pay for the mortgage, but also to account for property taxes, homeowner&rsquo;s insurance. and regular maintenance and repairs? Make sure you consider these issues before house hunting.</p><h3> Making a Career Change</h3><p> <br/> According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/nlsoy.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   Bureau of Labor Statistics  </a> </u> , the average person hold about 10 different jobs before the age of 40. Gen Y may have even more job changes, given how we value flexibility and mobility.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re planning a career change, it&rsquo;s best to get your financial house in order first. Depending on if you want to make a total career change, or just get something new in your field, you&rsquo;ll still have similar financial concerns:</p><li> Cost of re-training: If you need to go back to school, factor in admissions costs, books, and tuition</li><li> An increase or decrease in salary: If it&rsquo;s an increase, make sure to save at least 10% of your new salary for retirement. If it&rsquo;s a decrease, be sure you can live on the reduced salary so that there are no surprises when you receive your new, smaller paycheck</li><li> Moving for your job: If you need to move for your job, consider everything you need to do before you leave. Will you need to sell your house? Can you sell most of your things? How will you transport your car or pets? <br/>  </li><h3> Paying Down Debt</h3><p> <br/> Many Millennials have debt, but not all debt is created equal. If you have high-interest credit card debt, this should be one of the first things you try to pay off. Even if your credit card debt is smaller in relation to other debt, paying off high-interest debt is imperative &mdash; it&rsquo;s costing you the most.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t have any very high interest credit card debt or already achieved paying that down, look at your other debts and decide the most effective way to repay them. You can try the  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/tackle-your-debt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   debt avalanche or debt snowball methods  </a> </u> , depending on how you feel about the money you owe.</p><p> As you pay off your debts incrementally, put your &ldquo;extra&rdquo; payments to new debt. For example, if you paid $150 a month to a $2,000 debt, but recently paid it off, put that $150 toward another debt in addition to the amount you&rsquo;re paying now. You won&rsquo;t miss the money (because you&rsquo;re used to utilizing it for debt repayment), and you&rsquo;ll increase the speed at which you pay off your outstanding debts.</p><h3> Building an Emergency Fund</h3><p> <br/> Your emergency fund can protect you from the unexpected, and it&rsquo;s critical to have one in place. Ideally, you can aim to save three to six months&rsquo; worth of net expenses. If you have dependents, or work as a  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-budget-and-manage-your-finances-on-a-variable-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   freelancer with irregular income  </a> </u> , you&rsquo;ll want to save a little more.</p><p> You can keep this cash in a liquid account so it&rsquo;s easily accessible when you need it. Remember that you don&rsquo;t have to achieve your goal in a short period of time &mdash; it&rsquo;s more important to simply start saving for emergencies, even if it&rsquo;s just $10, $50, or $100 at a time.</p><h3> Making Room in Your Budget for Travel</h3><p> <br/> The most important consideration for saving up enough money to travel is that this is  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-handle-your-year-end-bonus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   something you prioritize  </a> </u> . You can afford to do what it most important to you, but you may not be able to afford everything you want to do.</p><p> Consider establishing a travel fund, and deposit extra savings, bonuses, and gifts in this account. You can even consider starting a side gig with the goal of funding a trip with those extra earnings.</p><h3> Saving for Retirement</h3><p> <br/> Although retirement is years away for most of Gen Y, it&rsquo;s an important milestone to consider today. If your employer offers a savings vehicle, like a 401(k), with a match, be sure to contribute as much as you can to get the match. If you&rsquo;re not getting your employer match, you&rsquo;re letting free money get away! You can also open your own traditional IRA or Roth IRA.</p><p> When it comes to determining how much you should save, it&rsquo;s important to think about the kind of future you want. What would you love to do in retirement? Do you want to retire early? Would you rather achieve financial independence?</p><p> Answering these questions will help you determine how much to put into your accounts each month. A good rule of thumb to start with is at least 10% of your gross income. Then work up from there.</p><h3> Starting Your Own Business</h3><p> <br/> Many Millennials want to take control of their work and run their own businesses &mdash; and it&rsquo;s possible to achieve! Before you take the  <u>  leap into entrepreneurship </u> , however, make sure you&rsquo;ve considered some of the following:</p><li> Do you have a business plan? It doesn&rsquo;t need to be complex but you should understand what your business goals are and how you&rsquo;ll achieve them.</li><li> What services or products will you offer? How will you get your first clients?</li><li> How much will you charge?</li><li> Do you have separate bank accounts set up for business finances?</li><li> Do you know how much you need to pay in taxes?</li><li> What does your emergency fund look like? Are you prepared for slow months?</li><li> How will you budget with a variable income?</li><li> Do you know  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/retirement-plans-for-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   how you&rsquo;ll save for retirement  </a> </u> ? <br/>  </li><p> You also need to put together a team of professionals, like a financial planner, CPA, and attorney, who can help you manage the financial side of your business.</p><h3> Buying a New Car</h3><p> <br/> There are many considerations to take into account when you get a new car (and only some of them have to do with how cool your car is on the inside). You need to determine whether you&rsquo;ll buy new or used, or if it makes more sense in your situation to lease.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll also want to decide how much cash you&rsquo;ll put down, or if you&rsquo;ll finance your car at all. Get quotes for auto insurance, as well &mdash; even if you find a great deal on your dream car, the monthly insurance costs could make owning the vehicle more expensive than you bargained for.</p><p> While you may not plan on having every milestone on this list, it&rsquo;s always important to be prepared for what&rsquo;s to come financially. However you decide to approach the big decisions in your life, make sure you carefully consider what you&rsquo;ll need to achieve your goals and the plan of action you want to take.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-09-30 19:56:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-09-30 19:56:10.000000","image_url":"2015/9/article_placeholder_0Df6AMS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/top-10-financial-goals-for-gen-y-and-considerations-for-each/\", \"post_id\": \"6461\", \"post_date\": \"2015-09-30 19:56:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-09-30 19:56:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"top-10-financial-goals-for-gen-y-and-considerations-for-each\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6460\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2972\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/photo-1443571678570-ce5eb7a2b67d-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"460\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443704400,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}

A: Your Maytag washer.</p><p> So maybe yours is a Whirlpool. Does that mean you are and your partner are headed off to the spin cycle? It depends. The success of a marriage is brand agnostic and definitely not contingent on the make and model of your washer. However, what is important is the main detergent you use &mdash; communication in liquid or powder form is strongly advised. </p><p> This wasn&rsquo;t reported in Consumer Reports but rather in the Journal of Family and Economic Issues entitled &ldquo;Financial Management Practices of Couples with Great Marriages&rdquo; by Linda Skogrand, Alena C. Johnson, Amanda M. Horrocks, and John DeFrain. Their research focused on 64 couples in the U.S., all who believe they have great marriages and effectively managed finances. The study was conducted from a family strengths perspective, a theory in social science that focuses on what is working well vs a deficit perspective approach that accentuates problems.</p><p> How do couples with great marriages manage money? Three important themes emerged from husbands and wives included within the research: </p><li> One of the partners handled the day-to-day finances that required trust and communication,</li><li> These couples had little or no debt to begin with or had a goal of paying off debt, and</li><li> Happy couples are frugal and live within their means. <br/>  </li><h3> Secret #1 - Communicating the Checkbook</h3><p> <br/> Happily married couples report that one spouse assumes the responsibility of Chief Checkbook Officer (a term I made up and not included in the study obviously). This was not a gender decision but based on the expertise, time, and desire of the other partner. Wives and husbands who took the role earned mutual trust and communicated the checkbook, planning for retirement, and investment decisions. Spouses were equally aware about the finances and household budget even though one assumed the lead role. Furthermore, the decision to make a major purchase, yes including the washing machine, was always discussed.  <u>  Related: Love and Money Part 1 - 3 ways to improve communication </u> . </p><h3> Secret #2 - Embracing a Debt-Free Philosophy</h3><p> <br/> Happily married couples embrace a debt-free philosophy and work toward a common goal. They pay credit cards in full and save for the big purchases until they can afford it. Contrary to what you might think, happy couples encounter the same financial challenges as the rest of the world related to loss of job, a decline in health, school loans, etc. However, the major difference is approaching these challenges was mindset. Each partner embraced a &lsquo;never give up&rsquo; and &lsquo;in it together&rsquo; attitude towards leading a debt-free or debt-reduction life.   </p><h3> Secret #3 - Don't Keep Up With the Kardashians</h3><p> <br/> Happily married couples don&rsquo;t try to keep up with Kardashians.

{"original_id":2891,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Volatility, Escalators, and Yo-Yos","link":"volatility-escalators-and-yo-yos","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Earlier this month I spoke to a group of women on choosing to choose (the brief version was included in my  <u>  <a href=\"http://kleinadvisors.com/resources/lauren-s-blog/entry/money-rules-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   July 28 blog  </a> </u> ), yet in the question and answer session, <strong>  I was asked the inevitable: &ldquo;Is the market going back up?&rdquo; My answer: &ldquo;Yes. Absolutely. Without a doubt, yes!&rdquo; </strong></p><p> If there&rsquo;s any doubt in your mind about how I can be so emphatic with my answer, it&rsquo;s probably because the recent market volatility has you, like many others, feeling like you&rsquo;re on an emotional rollercoaster when it comes to your invested assets. Here&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not worried:</p><p> Volatility is, literally, the up-and-down movement of the market caused by investor sentiments that drive trading activity. Technically, volatility is measured by the standard deviation from expectations, or &ldquo;normal&rdquo; market movement. &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; is about 5.8% a month and 20% a year. That&rsquo;s not much change, especially on a daily basis, and we get happily used to those nice, tiny fluctuations. But just like when we&rsquo;re riding on a real rollercoaster, those little bumps aren&rsquo;t so bad&mdash;it&rsquo;s the monstrous drops that make our stomachs turn over!</p><p> As we&rsquo;ve seen recently, volatility causes downward stock price pressure as anxious sellers drive down market prices. The current sell-off is being driven by amorphous fears about a slowdown in global growth. In the early 2000s, the cause was poor earnings and devaluations of tech companies. Then came the turmoil of 9/11. In 2008, it was the financial crisis. More recently, Greece and China have been the culprits. Each of these events brought uncertainty, which spurred volatility, which created fear. Of course, fear then impacts the market, which creates a vicious chicken-and-egg situation. The bank rush of the 1930s is a great example. Some banks collapsed, and the fear of more failures caused a run on the banks. Were all banks in trouble? No. But people who had their money in the institutions that did fail lost all their savings (deposit insurance didn&rsquo;t exist at the time), and that fact caused widespread panic.</p><h3> Clearly fear&mdash;especially when it comes to money&mdash;can be much more contagious than any plague.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The good news is that uncertainty eventually passes. </strong> Each crisis, whatever it may be, resolves itself one way or the other. Fear dissipates. And volatility levels return to normal. For investors, the most important thing to remember is that market volatility is temporary while the overall movement of the market is long-term.</p><p> Dan (an acquaintance, not a client!) was one of many who let fear drive his decisions back in 2008. He pulled everything out of the stock market to &ldquo;cut his losses.&rdquo; His plan, of course, was to put his money back in as soon as things returned to normal. But Dan&rsquo;s strategy had a major flaw. Now, at the end of a seven-year bull market, Dan asked me if it&rsquo;s safe to get &ldquo;back into the market?&rdquo; My answer, of course, is that investing requires discipline and education. And that if he thinks he has the skill to &ldquo;speculate&rdquo; on price fluctuations, well&hellip;he&rsquo;ll likely end up on the wrong side of every trade. If Dan would only take the time to understand investing and the story of the escalator and the yo-yo, then he&rsquo;d be ready to be a wise investor.</p><p> Picture it: you&rsquo;re on an up escalator playing with a yo-yo. The yo-yo is going up and down on a small scale, while the escalator is going one way&mdash;up&mdash;on a large scale. Yes, the yo-yo continues to move, but it (and you) continue to move in one direction: up! Now imagine the yoyo is market volatility, and the escalator is the market itself. Even if you&rsquo;re a really bad yoyo-er (like me) and the yo-yo falls all the way to the end of its string before you wrap it back up again, you&rsquo;re still continuing to move in the right direction.</p><p> Martin Brower is considered by many to be a real estate expert in Orange County. A former Irvine Company exec, he currently writes the column  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coastmagazine.com/articles/coast-3258-foot-forest.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Along the Coast  </a> </u>  in Orange County&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.coastmagazine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Coast Magazine  </a> </u> . As an expert, he&rsquo;s often asked, &ldquo;where is the real estate market headed?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve heard Martin answer, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going, but let me tell you where it&rsquo;s been.&rdquo; He then tells his own story of the Westchester home he purchased in the 1950s&mdash;what he paid then and today&rsquo;s price. He didn&rsquo;t talk about yo-yos, or the collapse in 2008, but he did point out that the trend is clearly up and the change is exponential. Over time. The lesson learned is this: As an asset class, real estate is good, but it&rsquo;s no greater than any other asset class. The perceived over-performance is the result of the typically very long hold period associated with home ownership. Holding on to your investments&mdash;whatever they may be&mdash;is the key to long-term success.</p><h3> So yes, the yo-yo has been going up and down for weeks now.</h3><p> <br/> And just as it started to settle down, the Fed opted not to raise interest rates. So we&rsquo;re back in yoyo territory. But just remember that the escalator is still going up.

{"original_id":2892,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"12 Great Ways to Improve Any Relationship","link":"12-great-ways-to-improve-any-relationship","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m getting married in a few months. I consider my future spouse to be my very best friend and very best everything for that matter. I&rsquo;m excited to be a wonderful and thoughtful partner. Of course, these high acclaims don&rsquo;t happen simply because I&rsquo;m an uber-nice person.</p><p> To be a truly great partner in any relationship requires effort and a major dose of consciousness. The latter is without question the deciding factor.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re looking to improve your relationships with your spouse, family, friends, coworkers, boss, business partners or whomever, I&rsquo;ve discovered there are several universal techniques that&mdash;when engaged by both parties&mdash;will make it successful. Let&rsquo;s take a peek.</p><p> <strong>  Find a common interest. </strong> Sharing passions, interests, hobbies or anything of that ilk will help even the oddest of couples get along better. The trick is to make sure to seek that common ground as early as possible and build on it as you go. I once had an obstinate, new client become extremely accommodating mere seconds after she heard my dog bark. You guessed it. She was a dog lover through and through.</p><p> <strong>  Pay attention. </strong> I considered listing this one as &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; That wouldn&rsquo;t have been strong enough. Listening is fabulous and should be done with the intent to hear and understand rather than to respond. But, &ldquo;paying attention&rdquo; is a higher level of awareness. What you pay attention to or what you focus on will grow&mdash;good or bad. Remember that.</p><p> <strong>  Dwell on the positives. </strong> What you pay attention to will grow and what you think about you&rsquo;ll bring about. You can focus on someone&rsquo;s shortcomings or you can focus on someone&rsquo;s positive traits. The latter is easier and more fun.</p><p> <strong>  Speak positively. </strong> There&rsquo;s that word &ldquo;positive&rdquo; again. Dwelling on the positives is one thing. You can internalize the positives all you want (and that&rsquo;s good), but actually communicating (as in out loud) in a positive manner requires a different level of energy. The other party isn&rsquo;t a mind reader. Remember that too.</p><p> <strong>  Pick up the slack. </strong> Have you ever had a bad day? Neither have I. Apparently there are many people in the world who occasionally have one. Perhaps they need a little compassion. Maybe they just need a helping hand to make it through the day. Make sure both of yours are ready. You might toss in a foot or two while you&rsquo;re at it.</p><p> <strong>  Compliment freely. </strong> Compliments are inexpensive and make people feel great. Just make sure you&rsquo;re sincere. And appropriate. Especially if you&rsquo;re at work. You get the gist.</p><p> <strong>  Perform random acts of kindness. </strong> There are birthdays, anniversaries, boss&rsquo; day (hint to the milewalk team who better be working right now), and so on. What&rsquo;s wrong with a little gift and a little love on a Tuesday that&rsquo;s nothing other than Tuesday?</p><p> <strong>  Share. </strong> What&rsquo;s mine is yours is a great way to go through life. I&rsquo;m sure my financ&eacute;e will take this opportunity to swipe my favorite pair of cutoff sweatpants that she covets. There&rsquo;s nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t do in the name of love.</p><p> <strong>  Laugh. </strong> Have you ever noticed that whenever you laugh you can&rsquo;t think about anything bad? Do it together and that makes two people who can&rsquo;t think of anything bad.</p><p> <strong>  Play. </strong> All work and no play&hellip; Moving right along.</p><p> <strong>  Turn off your phone. </strong> I would have said, &ldquo;Block all distractions and enjoy each other,&rdquo; but this little expression seems to cover that in this day and age.</p><p> <strong>  Say &ldquo;Thank You!&rdquo; </strong>  I think these are the two most powerful words in the English language. Of course, they can be followed by &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; which are the three most powerful words in the English language. (Please keep that one to non-work related relationships.) Rolling right along, the four most powerful words in the English language are &ldquo;I need your help.&rdquo;</p><p> I won&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s help saying, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 18:35:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 18:35:55.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_D5HzMSn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/12-great-ways-to-improve-any-relationship/\", \"post_id\": \"6469\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 18:35:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 18:35:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"12-great-ways-to-improve-any-relationship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6468\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2976\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1432105117111-b8c5bed69654.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"491\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443808800,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2893,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Living Single in Retirement: A Planning Guide","link":"living-single-in-retirement-a-planning-guide","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Lifestyle planning in retirement may be a bit easier when there is only one of you. It&rsquo;s very simple to create a bucket list for exactly what you&rsquo;d like to do during retirement. There are no arguments if you decide that travel just isn&rsquo;t for you &ndash; or if travel means a month in Italy or six months in a Winnebago. Although decision making when living single in retirement is easier, financing it without a partner may be a bit more of a challenge. It&rsquo;s a different retirement planning strategy.</p><h3> Fixed or Basic Expenses</h3><p> <br/> Whether single or coupled, we all have pretty much the same fixed or basic expenses in our working years and in retirement-mortgage/rent, utilities, insurance, taxes, food, personal hygiene and other debt repayment.</p><p> When you have that constant pay cheque coming in presumably we have learned to keep these essential costs within our means. As you creep closer to your retirement years, we should be aiming to reduce or eliminate some of these fixed costs (such as our mortgage and other debt repayments).</p><p> By the time you hit whatever ever age you decide to call &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; you should have reduced your overhead sufficiently enough to be fully covered by our incoming pension income (assuming you have some of course!). Whatever shortfall there is, your savings will have to cover. This is all a heck of a lot easier to finance if there are two of you versus one!</p><p> When there are two of you, there may well have been many years of dual income which also might mean there are dual streams of future pension income. If this is the case, you may be able to continue to sufficiently cover your basic fixed expenses in retirement without too much costs cutting or downsizing.</p><p> Even if there is only one source of incoming company pension income there still may be dual government pension income (twice the CPP &amp; OAS). Some reduction in overhead will be a must but you might still be able to cover your fixed expenses</p><h3> Living Single in Retirement</h3><p> <br/> However, if there is only one of you then having a company pension is extremely important. If you qualified for the highest level of pension income from the Government plans, this may only bring you in around $1,400 a month before taxes.</p><p> Unless your basic costs are under about $1,100 a month you might be in financial trouble if you have no savings or other sources of income. You may qualify for a Government supplement for being a low income earner but that still doesn&rsquo;t add too much to the overall picture.</p><p> Building a nest egg is much easier if there is dual income coming in. Particularly, in your mid to late empty nesting, mortgage free 50&rsquo;s. Even if you have not done any retirement planning or savings before this you can aggressively start now.</p><p> One salary can hopefully cover the majority of expenses and the other can be used for savings. Funds once meant to cover the mortgage can now be directed towards your RRSP&rsquo;s without missing it too much. However, when it&rsquo;s just you, saving becomes a bit more of a challenge even in your high income, mortgage free days. However, it is a must and especially important if you have no company pension.</p><p> <strong>  Start Saving Earlier in Life. </strong>  Saving earlier in life versus later is even more paramount if you&rsquo;re single. A health issue or job loss at any point can greatly impact your ability to invest in your later years. So starting small and early on is advisable versus assuming you will be employable and working in your 60s and can easily be contributing to your retirement. Look for employment that not only offers good health benefits but also a liveable pension plan. Disability insurance and insurance on your debt is also a must for singles.</p><p> <strong>  Have a Detailed Retirement Plan. </strong>  Retirement planning is essential for everyone. Whether you want to buy a house, fund a child&rsquo;s education or plan for your retirement. You need a plan. If you&rsquo;re single, planning is even more crucial for a successful and worry-free retirement. Even if you are in your 30&rsquo;s or 40&rsquo;s and still envision marriage in the future, financially plan for a one person retirement. If there happens to be another income source in the meantime then all the better! If there isn&rsquo;t you will not be any worse off.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 18:43:26.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 18:43:26.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_zndxLIF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/living-single-in-retirement-a-planning-guide/\", \"post_id\": \"6476\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 18:43:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 18:43:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"living-single-in-retirement-a-planning-guide\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6475\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2979\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HappyElderlyWoman.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"466\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443790800,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2894,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Militello Capital Introduces New Guide with Tools for RIAs to Modernize Portfolios and Practices","link":"militello-capital-introduces-new-guide-with-tools-for-rias-to-modernize-portfolios-and-practices","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Editor&rsquo;s note:  </strong> At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u> , we are always excited about collaborating with clients on new projects. When Bill Militello, founder and CEO of  <u>  <a href=\"http://militellocapital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Militello Capital  </a> </u> , came to us with the idea of creating a resource for the registered investment advisor (RIA) community, we were all ears. Generating insightful and useful content for financial services firms, particularly RIAs, is something we at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  are committed to and produce every day. We visited with Bill to explore his thinking behind Militello Capital&rsquo;s latest project, the Real Alternatives Report (RealReport&trade;), and how it can be a resource to advisors as it addresses and offers solutions to the pains and anxieties facing their community.</p><p> <strong>  Joe Anthony: What is the objective of the RealReport&trade;? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Bill:  </strong> The RealReport&trade; is intended to serve as a guide for RIAs who want to grow, compete and succeed in the industry by making informed decisions. Our objective is for RIAs to read this to learn more about how to modernize their portfolio and their investment practice by using alternative investments. We wanted to create something of value in the marketplace that educates and addresses common anxieties of the RIA. Given our own experience as an RIA, and having conversations with so many other RIAs in recent years, we have become acutely aware of advisors&rsquo; struggles. Because of this, we wanted to produce an actionable toolkit that comes from real world experience and is relevant to solving the pain and problems that RIAs are experiencing, as well as help them look over the horizon of what may be coming and how to position themselves accordingly.</p><p> Looking back 15 years ago companies said, &ldquo;I need a website or I&rsquo;m not competitive. I don&rsquo;t know how to do that. How do I get educated? Where&rsquo;s the guidebook that teaches me how to go out and secure and build a website?&rdquo; Five years ago it became, &ldquo;I need a Facebook page. How do I do that?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s always these new things that businesses need to stay competitive and relevant, and the RealReport&trade; is meant to be that guidebook to alternative investments as human advisors strive to stay relevant in the marketplace.</p><p> We lead off from a very macro-economic perspective and talk about regulation, technology in terms of robo-advisors, the importance of due diligence and products in terms of private real estate. There&rsquo;s really something in it for everybody.</p><p> <strong>  Joe: What are some of the trends and issues impacting the plight of the RIA? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Bill:  </strong> There are competitive forces at work with the advent of the robo-advisor; whether you believe, as a RIA, that&rsquo;s a threat or not, it certainly can&rsquo;t be dismissed out of hand. What we&rsquo;ve seen over the last 20 years is a very apparent and sustained compression of fees, which has a real impact on revenue to advisors. This has been a catalyst to other competitive forces like many new entrants to the marketplace and brokerage houses moving more toward the fee-only model, all while fees are coming down in concert with the decline in bond yields.</p><p> In addition, regulations have shifted a little bit in terms of providing an opportunity for investors of lesser means to have access to a different array of products that they might have kept at arm&rsquo;s length in the past. There&rsquo;s been an increase in buzz about how different sources of capital are providing funding for growing businesses, more or less serving as non-traditional avenues of venture capital for these businesses. An increase in both innovation and regulation has also served to make running a business more costly, thus presenting challenges and opportunities for RIAs.</p><p> There&rsquo;s always been a lot of different asset classes, such as private equity, private real estate and venture capital, but for a very long time, the traditionally trained advisor has constrained the asset allocation conversation or debate between two asset classes &ndash; publicly traded stocks and publicly traded bonds. And, while those two asset classes are certainly important and provide inexpensive massive diversification as well as liquidity, the goal of Militello Capital and the RealReport&trade; is to not only demonstrate that the ability to invest in private equity, venture capital and private real estate has been democratized, but show the meaningful impact that private equity, venture capital and private real estate provide the modern portfolio.</p><p> <strong>  Joe: For an RIA reading this, what takeaways are embedded in the RealReport&trade; as it relates to their boomer client? Mid-career client? Millennial client?   </strong></p><p> <strong>  Bill: </strong>  I think the common theme, whether we&rsquo;re talking boomer, mid-career or millennial, is being able to relate to your investment and really know your investment. At the boomer and mid-career level, these individuals can relate to investing in entrepreneurs and real estate and can appreciate the importance of adding them to a stock and bond portfolio because that&rsquo;s how they made their money to begin with. That&rsquo;s how they became high net worth.</p><p> On the other hand, millennials have just as strong a desire to add entrepreneurs and real estate to their stock and bond portfolio because they can relate to the technology the entrepreneurs are developing &ndash; it is what they&rsquo;ve grown up using and are most familiar. Millennials can relate to innovators in the marketplace, the Elon Musks and the Mark Zuckerbergs are their heroes just like previous generations idolized action heroes or sports figures.</p><p> What it really boils down to is offering clients investments they can relate to, and understanding why they relate to it.</p><p> <strong>  Joe: What is the one takeaway from the RealReport&trade; you think will have the most impact on how RIAs pursue their marketing and growth in 2016? </strong></p><p> <strong>  Bill:  </strong> The main takeaway of the RealReport&trade; that advisors can utilize is for them to take a hard look at their relevance in the current marketplace, and be willing to shift their philosophy to an &ldquo;adapt or die&rdquo; mentality. In this hyper-competitive environment, advisors need to have a differentiator to compete, to both attract and retain their most coveted clients. The best way to do this, in my opinion, is by articulating a philosophy of wealth creation and implementing it through well-vetted private investment deals. In nature, human advisors are either growing or dying. The RealReport&trade; strives to empower advisors to become a wealth creator and start growing so they can continue to be an asset to their clients. The report is chock full of ideas on how to be a wealth creating advisor, because in essence, it is their only shot at differentiating themselves from the other competitive forces.</p><p> To read the full RealReport&trade;,  <u>  click here </u>  to download.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 18:48:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 18:48:07.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_kWUSiqS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/militello-capital-introduces-new-guide-with-tools-for-rias-to-modernize-portfolios-and-practices/\", \"post_id\": \"6478\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 18:48:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 18:48:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"militello-capital-introduces-new-guide-with-tools-for-rias-to-modernize-portfolios-and-practices\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6477\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2980\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mil-real-bill-700x395.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"904\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443813600,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

They all share a common a theme: <strong>  the annual performance review is a relic, a thing of the past that began with good intentions but has done little to advance the goal to improve employee performance. </strong> In fact, it seems they do more harm than good. <strong>  Why not do away with them altogether? </strong></p><p> You might imagine that as the CTO of a software company that develops performance management solutions that I might be a bit nervous about what is clearly a rapidly developing trend in our market. On the contrary, I&rsquo;m dancing a jig! I promise, I will keep the product/company plug to a minimum if you read further. TalentGuard was founded on the principal that employee performance is best achieved by measuring performance against role-specific objective measures and not the one-size-fits-all assessments the subject of much disdain. Let me explain&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  The fundamental flaw with the annual performance appraisal is the appraisal itself. </strong> The classic general behavioral assessment does little if anything to help an employee understand how they are performing relative to a complete set of objective performance criteria for their particular role. What if you could replace this general assessment with one tailored to each individual role? Would that affect the outcome? Intuitively and empirically we know that such an approach is superior to the classic model. I believe it is the only effective approach and hence supports the movement to kill the classic performance appraisal as we know it today.</p><p> The key to this working is having a &ldquo;complete set of objective performance measures tied to each individual role&rdquo;, i.e., a better appraisal. Before the advent of modern web applications, these objective measures, or competency models, were very difficult to develop let alone apply to a company with more than a handful of roles. For those reading who may have never heard of competency models, a competency model refers to the specific competencies that are characteristic of high performance and success in a given job and can include both technical and behavioral competencies across skills and abilities. Typically, skills are thought of as learned and abilities are innate. For example, I can develop the skill to manage but may lack the innate ability to lead with empathy and thus my effectiveness as a leader may be less than needed for my role. Both can be developed.</p><p> Since there are many roles (jobs) in any given company, there can and should be many competency models. HR departments, however, struggle to get value from the application of role specific competency models due to the overwhelming amount of data that must be pulled together and applied to every role and ultimately every individual. It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to do this manually within a company that has more that a few dozen roles. We address this problem by providing a comprehensive framework manager, competency models from leading industry competency model developers, and a role management system that allows HR professionals to create roles tied directly to role-specific competency models.</p><p> <strong>  Is the annual performance review on its way out the door? </strong> I certainly hope so! But before you abandon the idea of performance reviews altogether take a look at how companies like TalentGuard are bringing better solutions to the market that ultimately deliver on a promise made over 60 years ago but never fulfilled. And if you think I&rsquo;m right then look for my next post that will talk about how to leverage a proper performance review for career pathing and succession planning!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 18:57:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 18:57:13.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_sVYjYOv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dead-man-walking-the-annual-performance-review/\", \"post_id\": \"6480\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 18:57:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 18:57:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dead-man-walking-the-annual-performance-review\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6479\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2981\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-01-at-11.56.51-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"558\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443798000,"author_id":309,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2896,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Breadth of Customer Insight","link":"the-breadth-of-customer-insight","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Different businesses continue to use the term &ldquo;Customer Insight&rdquo; to mean different things. <br/> <br/> In our poll of over 100 customer insight leaders, only half considered data management or database marketing to be part of Customer Insight. The majority also had only research reporting into them, not analytics. Does that ring true with your role? <br/> <br/>  In June, I shared a  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/definition/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   definition of Customer Insight  </a> </u>  that I find useful:</p>A non-obvious understanding about your customers, which if acted upon, has the potential to change their behaviour for mutual benefit.<p> <br/> I would stress four parts of that definition:</p><li> First, that  <strong>  insights are non-obvious </strong> ; they normally require the convergence of evidence for multiple sources to help spot themes and then dig deeper for motivations. </li><li> Second, that  <strong>  true insights need to be actionable </strong> , as there is no point learning something unless you can change commercial results or customer experience as a result. </li><li> Third, a good test of an &ldquo;insight&rdquo; is whether  <strong>  acting on it is powerful enough to change your customers&rsquo; behaviour </strong>  (not just data to target those you believe will act as they have in the past). </li><li> Fourth, in this &ldquo;Age of the Customer,&rdquo; the importance of trust should mean any insight has the goal of  <strong>  mutual benefit for the organisation </strong> <strong>  and the customer </strong> , anything else is short term success for long-term value erosion. <br/>  </li><p> You may need to wear many hats to achieve that kind of insight production from your team. As I've  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/the-hybrid-ci-leader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   written in the past  </a> </u> , you may need to be a Data Scientist, Psychologist, Artist, Storyteller, Sales Coach, Economist, and People Leader. Quite a challenge and perhaps one reason why leaders like you are hard to find. <br/> <br/> Some people suggest that Customer Insight is making use of your data, with the current buzzword being &ldquo;big data.&rdquo; But it is possible to be drowning in data and still none the wiser about your customers. Perhaps as a result, some leaders appear to equate CI with behavioural analysis and statistical modelling (with the buzzword here being &ldquo;predictive analytics&rdquo;). Such analytics can be very powerful, but without an understanding of why customers are behaving as they are, it won&rsquo;t pass the test of our Insight definition. <br/> <br/> You may assume that Customer Insight as a term applies to research, qualitative and quantitative activities focussed on that &ldquo;why&rdquo; question. But with the unreliability of self-reporting and the need to behaviourally test what customers actually do, to identify any behavioural economic biases at play, can this really be relied upon by itself? So you might conclude that the only way to know the reality is to test and learn, using targeted communications and measurement from database marketing. That is also very useful, but what understanding helps create what should be tested? <br/> <br/> As is probably obvious from that definition, I would recommend that all four of those technical disciplines are needed to create true customer insights. However, it is not just these separate parts operating effectively in isolation, rather the synergies and insights that can be realised by the working together in collaboration. As I&rsquo;ve heard different experts speak on this topic over the years and seen some of your progress in this regard, it seems to me that we are talking about an ecosystem here. So the challenge for Customer Insight Leaders becomes how to nurture this ecosystem, ensuring each part fulfills its potential and acts symbiotically with others to produce the healthy fruit of actionable customer insights (in a way that feels more organic than mechanistically following a set process). <br/> <br/> Ensuring a consistent source of quality data for all the technical teams is at the heart of this ecosystem. Those using that data will need to be skilled research, analytics, and database marketing teams (hopefully brought together in one CI function). Real growth, however it appears, happens when you use these parts together. For example, converging the evidence from analysis and research to produce a more robust picture of how customers are feeling and acting and why. That should enable hypotheses to be generated as to how customers would feel and act if you did something different. Offering something different (communication/experience/product) can then be tested with experimental design using database marketing skills. Once you can see any changes in customer behaviour as a result, also check out the feelings of customers and observe the touch points to get a feel for their new experience. Such research and analysis output then brings us back to the stage of converging evidence and looking for themes (a virtuous circle of continuous improvement). <br/> <br/> There is more to customer insight generation than that, but I&rsquo;ll blog another time about applications like generating insights for proposition design. For now, I wanted to share what is becoming a standard model for me in helping clients. <br/> <br/> Do those themes resonate with you? Any other tips you can share?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 19:03:37.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 19:03:37.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_fDO9IAD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-breadth-of-customer-insight/\", \"post_id\": \"6482\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 19:03:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 19:03:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-breadth-of-customer-insight\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6481\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2982\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1443632826930-7e5bc4aa7fa0-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"560\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443812400,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}

As much as the word &lsquo;boss&rsquo; totally creeps me out (it&rsquo;s soooo &rsquo;90&rsquo;s already), the reality is, many of us have some level of anxiety when it comes to having certain conversations with the person responsible for our pay packet.</p><p> Bringing up topics like  their  leadership style,  your  priorities and workload, or even differences of opinion on the current strategy, can lead to brow-mopping anxiety.</p><p> Throughout my time as an  <u>  executive coach </u> , I&rsquo;ve noticed some phrases which can help you to build a better relationship with your boss (oops there it is&hellip;dropping the B bomb again) AND your peers.</p><p> <strong>  1. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just read this interesting article on&hellip;&rdquo; </strong> <br/> Keeping your finger on the pulse with the latest industry news, then sharing what you know, will show you have a genuine interest in your profession and the organisation.</p><p> <strong>  2. &ldquo;Thank you for&hellip;I really appreciated it when you&hellip;&rdquo; </strong> <br/> We tend to be reticent about giving positive feedback to our manager in case we look like Mr or Mrs &lsquo;Suck-Up-Teacher&rsquo;s-Pet&rsquo;. But, as a leader yourself, you know how much of an impact that genuine, specific, positive feedback from those you lead can have, and how it helps you to do more of what makes you an effective leader.</p><p> <strong>  3. &ldquo;What keeps you awake at night?&rdquo; </strong> <br/> This is meant in a metaphorical sense, although sometimes it is literal! Knowing what is taking up your manager&rsquo;s or chairman&rsquo;s head space (being aware of topics that are causing them concern) is the perfect way of determining his or her priorities. It also provides an opportunity to focus your efforts on solving said problem.  See point 5 for a next step after this.</p><p> <strong>  4. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to discuss priorities.&rdquo; </strong> <br/> This is an especially helpful phrase if your manager keeps changing priorities or loading up extra work on you without giving consideration to what you already have on your plate.  We tend to bite off more than we can chew, which leads to scattered/conflicting priorities and stressed out, worn out people.</p><p> Spend some time preparing for this meeting, then present current/key projects and ask, what is most important? What needs to be revised as a consequence? If we need to do all of this by these deadlines, what extra resource is available? See  <u>  here </u>  for further tips on prioritising.</p><p> <strong>  5. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about our problem and I&rsquo;ve looked into it&hellip;&rdquo; </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ll never forget the time when a high-performing team member of mine took the time to conduct extra research and look into a business problem we&rsquo;d been grappling with for months. A few extra hours of effort not only resulted in a number of powerful solutions, it also impressed the hell out of me by showing such initiative.</p><p> <strong>  6. &ldquo;What would you like me to keep doing, stop doing, start doing or do more of?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t wait for the  <u>  annual &lsquo;dump-truck&rsquo; performance appraisal </u>  to find out what your manager thinks of you and your performance. In my practice I have found that many of us are still uncomfortable with giving developmental feedback. Asking the question above is a great segue to  this conversation.</p><p> <strong>  7. &ldquo;How would you like me to give you feedback? </strong>  And &ndash; &ldquo;If I disagree with you or you are doing something that is brassing me off, how do you want me to tell you?&rdquo;</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t really matter how you phrase this. Basically, you&rsquo;re asking them if it&rsquo;s OK for you to give them constructive feedback. No boss is going to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;&hellip;unless they&rsquo;re  <u>  THAT guy </u> . This is a good conversation to catalyse setting up processes for giving feedback. If you have a regular mechanism in place, then it becomes like the ebb and flow of the tides, making it easier to have a crucial conversation or broach delicate feedback.</p><p> <strong>  8. &ldquo;I want to give you a heads up on some bad news.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> No one likes nasty surprises. Not going to make that deadline? Don&rsquo;t wait until the eleventh hour to tell them. Not going to make the monthly sales or profit target? Like the markets, give a &ldquo;revised earnings announcement&rdquo; as soon as you can. If you feel like running a million miles in the other direction and completely avoiding the conversation,  that&rsquo;s your cue to do the opposite.

But how do you convince your CEO that the risks of not embracing this new social paradigm far outweigh the risks of embracing it.</p><h3> In other words, how do you convince your CEO that it makes  business  sense to get social?</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s how to show them the money.</p><p> As financial services marketers we understand that the audience is now king.</p><p> This means that our customers and prospects (our audience) are online researching our products and services, reading other customers&rsquo; reviews about our brands, and using social channels to engage in two-way conversations with us.</p><p> And with 14 million of Australia&rsquo;s 23 million people on Facebook alone in June, the audience is definitely already social.</p><p> <strong>  Social Media Statistics Australia &ndash; June 2015 </strong></p><p> <br/> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/5-ways-brands-can-get-away-collection-and-do-better-social-165579\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   survey released at Cannes this year  </a> </u>  by Social@Ogilvy and Survey Monkey found that &ldquo;for brands to successfully use social media to help achieve their business goals, they need to move away from simply collecting likes and getting retweets and instead provide relevant, genuine interaction with their customers and brand boosters&rdquo;.</p><p> So here&rsquo;s the five fact-driven reasons your CEO needs to embrace social media.</p><li> <strong>  Customers reward businesses that serve them on social media   </strong></li><p> Customer behaviour is changing.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2013-social-media-benchmark-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Statistics from the United States  </a> </u>  show that 67% of consumers have used a company&rsquo;s social media site for customer service, double the number that used it for social marketing (including discounts, coupons etc.).</p><p> And that&rsquo;s not all. A recent Nielsen report found  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/reports/2012/state-of-the-media-the-social-media-report-2012.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   33% of users actually prefer to contact brands using social media rather than the telephone  </a> </u> .</p><p> But what does this mean for the bottom line? Good news. Better engagement with customers via social media does translate into cold hard cash. A recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/putting-social-media-to-work.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article by Bain &amp; Co  </a> </u>  revealed that customers who engage with businesses on social media will spend between 20-40% more when compared with other customers.</p><p> Not only does a good social media presence increase customer satisfaction, it also drives revenue.</p><li> <strong>  Legally, a social media presence is becoming a must-have </strong></li><p> Regulators in Australia and the US now recognise that information and conversations on social media impact a company&rsquo;s reputation, and therefore its share price.</p><p> And when it comes to mandatory disclosure, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/social-media-dont-risk-not-risking-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   July 2015 ASIC directive  </a> </u>  allowed for digital channels to be the default channels for company information disclosure.</p><p> This directive builds on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.asx.com.au/documents/about/guidance-note-8-clean-copy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ASX&rsquo;s 2013 guidance on disclosure  </a> </u>  in which it advised companies to monitor online for sensitive information, or suffer the consequences.</p><p> This recognition by Regulators of the importance of social media as a means of communication has changed the playing field forever. The risk of saying nothing when there is the option of disclosing information is becoming too high. Civil penalties for non-compliance are hefty, and there is even scope to inadvertently commit a criminal offence.</p><li> <strong>  Social media is just as important for sales in B2B as B2C </strong></li><p> Some financial services CEOs may &ldquo;get it&rdquo; for B2C, but continue to question the importance of social media is in the B2B environment.</p><p> Consider the following figures:</p><li> 85% of B2B buyers would like companies to present information via social networks. (Iconsive)</li><li> But only 20% of CMOs leverage social networks to engage with customers. (Marketing Land) <br/>  </li><p> The canny CMO clearly has a window of opportunity to give their B2B customers what they want, while at the same time differentiating their brand from the competition.</p><li> <strong>  The sociability of the CEO is seen as a marker for the company as a whole </strong></li><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.webershandwick.com/uploads/news/files/Social-CEO-Study.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study by Weber Shandwick  </a> </u>  found that two-thirds of customers said their opinion of the CEO directly impacted their perception of the company. Needless to say, a CEO who is active on social media is building his/her personal brand with every interaction, (more on the benefits of this in point five), but if the CEO acts in an authentic and appealing way on social media, the company brand will also benefit.</p><p> And a quick word about the importance of staying authentic. It&rsquo;s difficult to outsource yourself and stay yourself, so for CEOs not managing their own social profiles, we recommend that at the very least they take on the role of editor-in-chief. Inauthenticity can be spotted a mile away&hellip; and it isn&rsquo;t appealing.</p><li> <strong>  The best jobs may well go to the most social CEO </strong></li><p> Finally, if your CEO isn&rsquo;t convinced about the benefits to the business, perhaps some reasons closer to home might tip the scales.</p><p> In their book &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://aworldgonesocial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A World Gone Social  </a> </u> &rdquo;, Ted Coin&eacute; and Mark Babbitt found that potential CEO candidates are now assessed on their social presence. All else being more or less equal, Boards expressed a strong preference for a modern CEO, with real social media competency and activity.</p><p> Five years ago, when boards were searching for a leader, social media proficiency wasn&rsquo;t even on the radar. Fast forward five years from now and social media fluency looks like being table stakes when going for the top job.</p><p> Now it&rsquo;s your turn. What compelling reason convinced your CEO to get social?</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 19:43:49.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 19:43:49.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_Oadu76I.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-fact-driven-reasons-your-ceo-needs-to-embrace-social-media/\", \"post_id\": \"6488\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 19:43:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 19:43:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-fact-driven-reasons-your-ceo-needs-to-embrace-social-media\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6487\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2985\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/person-apple-laptop-notebook-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"555\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443809700,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

So many times, the names of people will come to us causing wonder as to what they are doing in the moment. This is the best time to reach out and touch that person with the goodwill gesture and communication that you are thinking about them.</p><p> Just today, a familiar name from the past picked up the phone to call me.

It&rsquo;s not often people go out of their way to reconnect with others, so when you do, it will be a very positive mark in your favor and go a long way in further building the relationship between you.

Not only will you make someone else&rsquo;s day with your thoughtfulness, the connection will also become a two-way road for business development.

{"original_id":2901,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Getting Insanely Qualified Leads from Insanely Honest Content Marketing","link":"getting-insanely-qualified-leads-from-insanely-honest-content-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> Honesty is fundamental to advertising, marketing and sales, but very few businesses are willing to be  insanely  honest; so honest that it&rsquo;s a little bit (or a lot) uncomfortable. </p><p> Being insanely honest means actively volunteering the weakest parts of your business. That&rsquo;s a terrifying prospect, especially in your marketing. Conventional wisdom tells us to put our best foot forward, making sure our prospects get the best picture of our businesses from the very start. </p><p> But what if instead of your best foot, we put your &ldquo;worst foot&rdquo; forward? </p><p> At INBOUND15 Doug Kessler, co-founder and creative director at London based B2B content marketing firm Velocity, gave us his thoughts on insanely honest content marketing. Here are his 6 reasons you should put your worst foot forward in your marketing and advertising:</p><h3> 1. It Surprises and Charms</h3><p> <br/> No one likes people who boast about themselves day in and day out. Does your marketing function the same way?</p><li> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re industry leaders&rdquo; </li><li> &ldquo;Our solutions are best in class&rdquo; </li><li> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s largest supplier&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Sound familiar? None of those statements are particularly compelling, convincing or charming. Even worse, they are the same things your competitors are saying. Maybe its time to change your approach:</p><li> &ldquo;Being number two means we can&rsquo;t afford to provide bad service.&rdquo;  <br/>  </li><p> Being honest about where your weaknesses are is surprising and creates an approachability not afforded by traditional marketing. </p><h3> 2. It Signals Confidence</h3><p> <br/> Successful companies have a clear picture of themselves, their products, their competition and their customers. It&rsquo;s this confidence that lets companies be strategic about the clients they take on or the services they offer; saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to short term revenue to better capitalize on opportunities more inline with their business.</p><p> Communicating this confidence is extremely difficult. </p><p> One of the easiest ways to show your business&rsquo; confidence is to admit where it&rsquo;s weakest. Being up front with what your business doesn&rsquo;t do (and why that is) could be the first step to showing your prospects how confident you are in your strengths. </p><h3> 3. It Builds Trust</h3><p> <br/> Gaining trust is the most important part of marketing and sales. Without trust, converting leads and customers is nearly impossible.</p><p> What better way to build trust than being honest? Being up front with your business&rsquo; weaknesses means your prospects can trust you when you talk about your strengths.</p><h3> 4. It Alienates Unlikely Buyers</h3><p> <br/> Wasting your time on leads that aren&rsquo;t qualified isn&rsquo;t just inconvenient, it costs your business time and money. Being precise with your audiences and marketing will improve the percentage of qualified leads.</p><p> The best way to filter out less than qualified leads is to be honest with your business&rsquo; weaknesses. Those weaknesses will inevitably come up in your sales process, so why not be up front with them?</p><p> Instead of wasting your valuable time on deals that are far less likely to close, why not filter them out early and spend more time on those leads you know you can win?</p><h3> 5. It Attracts Ideal Customers</h3><p> <br/> While honest content filters out unqualified leads, it also attracts ideal leads. Your ideal leads are those prospects that won&rsquo;t be turned away by what your company doesn&rsquo;t do, and are inherently more interested in your strengths. </p><h3> 6. It Focuses The Conversation On The Battles You Can Win</h3><p> <br/> Your sales and marketing teams shouldn&rsquo;t be wasting their time fighting battles they know they can&rsquo;t win. Trying to spin your negatives into positives isn&rsquo;t just a time sink, it can cause prospects to lose trust in your business.</p><p> Instead, focus your conversations on battles you can win. Addressing your weaknesses head on means you can more effectively talk about your strengths.</p><p> How can honest content marketing improve your position in the marketplace?</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 19:56:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 19:56:07.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_xFPyryv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/getting-insanely-qualified-leads-from-insanely-honest-content-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"6492\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 19:56:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 19:56:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"getting-insanely-qualified-leads-from-insanely-honest-content-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6493\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2987\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pexels-photo-large_7.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"441\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443835800,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2902,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Do You Mean I Was Sleeping?","link":"what-do-you-mean-i-was-sleeping","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Every year I see many patients that tell me that they get only a few hours of sleep each night. In fact, I have had several swear they barely sleep at all. In most cases, they honestly believe this to be true. Interestingly, <strong>  if we bring them into our sleep lab, many of these individuals will insist that they slept only a few hours when their electroencephalogram (EEG) indicates that they actually slept much longer. </strong></p><p> This is a type of insomnia called <strong>  Paradoxical Insomnia </strong> , also referred to as Sleep State Misperception. Previously, we thought it to be rare and probably present in no more than five percent of insomnia sufferers. We now know this to be incorrect. Furthermore, in several recent studies, the incidence is closer to 50% when defined as misperceiving sleep as wake time by at least one hour or more per night.</p><p> As a result, we are now coming to realize <strong>  there are two basic types of insomniacs&ndash;those who sleep greater than six hours but perceive they sleep less, and those who actually sleep less than six hours and accurately estimate their sleep time. </strong></p><p> Why is it important to differentiate the two? The group that in reality sleeps less than six hours is much more likely to develop hypertension, diabetes, and suffer earlier death than the group that misperceives their sleep time. These findings are potentially revolutionary when it comes to our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia. Consequently, we need objective data in order to differentiate these two types since effective treatment approaches are different.</p><p> What I find fascinating is that those with misperception are more likely to respond to CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). While those who actually sleep less than six hours, the short sleeper type, are more likely to require pharmacological therapies. We believe this to be because the short sleepers have an underlying level of physiological hyperarousal. They have elevated levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, while the misperception group seems to demonstrate more of a psychological basis for their insomnia.</p><p> The good news is that in sleep medicine we now have accurate tools for differentiating these two types. We have a device called an actigraph that is worn like a wristwatch on the subject&rsquo;s arm. It correlates movement with wakefulness and its absence with sleep. Even more astonishing is a new form of technology called the Sleep Profiler.

Many wives have fallen into the trap of allowing their husband to control and maintain the relationship with their financial advisor. Marcia says that \"women are completely comfortable talking about many 'M-word' topics: their marriages, motherhood and their mothers, merlots and martinis, mammograms and menopause. But bring up money and the conversations screech to a halt. Ask how prepared a woman is for retirement and she can tell you the exact date when she wants to retire, but not how much money she'll need for a 30-year retirement.\"She feels that this has to change. The realities of living longer, and potentially on their own in retirement, requires that women take a much more proactive approach to planning for their retirement. This includes not only being more active with their financial advisor, but also playing a role in how financial accounts are structured, addressing their credit history and credit score, and creating a \"freedom fund.\"Marcia believes that women have to pay more attention to their financial plans and needs than perhaps they have in the past. She points out some easy ways in which women can do this in her book, while also reminding them of the reasons why it's so necessary.Whether financial advisors will pay particular attention to the financial planning needs of women will be up to them. But the success of their practice may depend upon their ability to do so.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-01 20:05:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-01 20:05:23.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_TYQJRtD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-retirement-planning-is-different-for-women/\", \"post_id\": \"6497\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-01 20:05:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-01 20:05:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-retirement-planning-is-different-for-women\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6496\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2989\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MW-DV263_retire_20150928125236_MG.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"570\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1443794400,"author_id":205,"chart_url":""}

Before I go any further, let me define in my own words what a webinar actually is. A webinar is an online meeting where a presenter goes through slides or a video as he or she would in real life, but it's in a virtual space that's recorded and attendees join and watch from their private screens rather than attending in real life. Because it's virtual, data is easily collected and the entire sessions, including Q&amp;A, can be recorded and used at a later time.Webinars are an inexpensive or even free (you may have to pay for a speaker), relatively easy way to engage, nurture, convert, and move prospects and customers alike through a path to purchase. Likewise, you can highlight content that is thought leadership focused (how-to) or product focused (solution), you can feature 3rd parties or executives from within your own company. And, you are able to collect as much or as little data on your attendees as you wish, making your follow-up process seamless and very personalized with examples such as:<li> <strong>  Did they attend the webinar or just register? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What do you want them to attend next (aka what is your Call to Action)? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Are they a lead, a current opportunity in your sales pipeline, or a customer? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What products are they already using, and what is a potential upsell/cross-sell? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What is their title/persona, and are they a decision maker or influencer in the buying process? </strong></li>According to a <a href=\"http://www.demandgenreport.com/industry-topics/industry-news/2397-webinar-content-follow-up-and-scoring-help-convert-prospects-to-leads.html#.UoJnXpTF218\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  recent article by Demand Gen Report </u> ,</a> timely follow-up from webinars (and from any demand gen program for that matter), leads to higher conversion rates. No surprise there! The report goes so far as to say that attendees of a webinar are&hellip; &ldquo;900% more likely to buy from a company if the follow up occurs within 5 minutes after the event concluded. Yet, only .6% of companies that have prospects fill out forms follow up within 5 minutes&rdquo;. I would say that might be too close &ndash; 5 minutes seems, well, a little Big Brotherish. However, a day is a more reasonable timeframe and still lends itself to a much higher conversion.Lastly, after a webinar has occurred, it&rsquo;s important to &ldquo;Nurture, Score, and Notify Sales&rdquo;. What does that mean?<li> <strong>  Nurture: </strong> If a lead isn&rsquo;t ready to buy or doesn&rsquo;t have decision-making capabilities, how do you keep them engaged over a long period of time, perhaps until they are ready to buy in 6 months to a year? There is automation software available that makes this nurturing process easy and trackable.</li><li> <strong>  Score: </strong> Have a scoring system in place that allows software (usually a nurturing software will also serve a scoring purpose) to identify your hottest leads versus your weakest leads. This is usually based on which email address they provided (work versus Hotmail), title of the attendee, size of the company, and many other factors you can set based on your qualification criteria.</li><li> <strong>  Notify Sales: </strong> Often times, Sales teams will complain that they don&rsquo;t know which Marketing events are happening, and how they should follow-up with existing opportunities in the sales pipeline and/or existing customers. Equipping Sales teams with proper messaging, event overview, and specific talk tracks and CTAs is of utmost importance. For customers especially, they are watching how your company follows-up with them, and it&rsquo;s important that it&rsquo;s done in a timely and relevant manner.</li><strong> All in all, webinars are an effective tool for engaging attendees of all sorts.</strong>The keys to success are identifying the right speaker and topic, ensuring that the registration is well communicated, collecting customer data, and following up in a timely and relevant matter with all attendees.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 13:41:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 13:41:38.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_fUJnZJl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-webinars-are-a-key-element-to-your-b2b-strategy/\", \"post_id\": \"6501\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 13:41:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 13:41:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-webinars-are-a-key-element-to-your-b2b-strategy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6500\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2992\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-04-at-6.50.44-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"532\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444060800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

There comes a time when there must be some internal focus on efficiency, and the introduction of leverage in the form of staff freeing up the leaders time in order for the leader to get out and keep leading. See what I did there?  The Leadership needs to be in place first&hellip;.</p><p> To grow a professional practice beyond a job for the partner, or partners, a clear vision must be established.  The leader&rsquo;s role is then to keep telling and selling the vision to all the stakeholders, and support the attainment of the vision with sound strategy.</p><p> This is the most defining difference between those professional services practices that remain jobs for their owners, and those that grow to become something of substance in their community.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/foundation-of-productivity.jpg?w=610&amp;h=318\"/></p> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 13:55:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 13:55:39.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_YnFhaXw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/practice-growth-requires-leadership-more-than-management/\", \"post_id\": \"6503\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 13:55:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 13:55:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"practice-growth-requires-leadership-more-than-management\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6502\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2993\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1443827423664-eac70d49dd0d.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"357\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444044600,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2907,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Do Your Kids Know How Much Money You Make?","link":"do-your-kids-know-how-much-money-you-make","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Do your kids know how much money you make? </strong> If not, and they asked, would you feel comfortable telling them?</p><p> My hunch is that the most common answer to both these questions is \"No.\" Talking about money is such a strong taboo that it often keeps us from sharing information about our earnings and net worth even with members of our immediate families.</p><p> Yet being honest with children about what we earn and how we spend it is a perfect opportunity to teach them important life lessons about money.</p><h3> Here are a few suggestions to foster those conversations:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Take advantage of teachable moments.</h3><p> As with many other big questions, like where babies come from or whether cats go to heaven (personally, I doubt it, but that may say more about my prejudices than my theology), the ideal time to answer money questions is when the kids ask.</p><h3> 2. Provide context for numbers.</h3><p> To a child who gets an allowance of five bucks a week, either $10,000 or $100,000 a year can seem huge. One way to put those numbers into context is with comparisons: \"I earn about the same amount as your teachers do,\" or, \"Most doctors probably earn about twice as much as our family does.\"</p><h3> 3. Talk about expenses as well as income.</h3><p> This is huge. It's another important way of providing context. Plus it helps open kids' eyes to the realities of earning and spending. When my kids, at about age 10 and 14, first asked about my income, they were impressed with how high the number was. Then we looked at the family expenses: house payment, health insurance, food, college savings, and everything else. They were even more impressed. Seeing what things cost and where the money goes is a good start to educating kids about spending, saving, and creating healthy money habits.</p><h3> 4. Share appropriately for kids' ages and understanding.</h3><p> Seven-year-olds and 13-year-olds aren't ready for the same information. Don't underestimate your kids' comprehension, however; if you encourage them to ask questions and are willing to explain and clarify, they may understand more than you expect.</p><h3> 5. Tell the truth.</h3><p> If you have financial difficulties that stem from your own money mistakes or other bad choices, being honest with your kids can be a powerful teaching opportunity. If you don't earn a lot but are managing to take care of the family, that's something to be proud of. If your kids may inherit substantial amounts, it's wise to start teaching them early how to deal with wealth. Whether you have a net worth in the millions or are barely getting by from month to month, clean honesty about the family finances is a good policy.</p><h3> 6. Remember that you're the adult.</h3><p> Over-sharing about financial challenges can frighten your kids. It's more useful to be matter-of-fact about problems and focus on what you're doing to solve them.</p><h3> 7. Keep in mind that when parents don't talk about money, kids will make up their own stories.</h3><p> Typically this will be either that you earn and have more than you do, or that the family is on the brink of bankruptcy and homelessness.</p><h3> 8. Look at your own shame and secrecy about money.</h3><p> If parents never talk about money, kids may never ask money questions. Either the topic is simply not on their radar, or they have internalized the unspoken message that it is off limits. In either case, parents can change the family culture by becoming more open about their finances. Those teachable moments for kids begin to happen when money is no longer a secret. </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 14:07:17.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 14:07:17.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_LBpiU7t.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/do-your-kids-know-how-much-money-you-make/\", \"post_id\": \"6505\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 14:07:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 14:07:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"do-your-kids-know-how-much-money-you-make\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6504\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2994\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_1549.PNG\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"661\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444048200,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2908,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Things to Say When Prospects Don't Have the Time for Your Presentation","link":"7-things-to-say-when-prospects-dont-have-the-time-for-your-presentation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  We&rsquo;ve all been there &ndash; you call your prospect back at the appointed time for your presentation and they tell you any of the following: </strong></p><p> This isn&rsquo;t a good time, OR</p><p> They only have a few minutes, OR</p><p> They ask you in an exasperated tone, &ldquo;How long will this take?&rdquo; OR</p><p> They tell you they have a meeting in 10 minutes, can you give them the information anyway?</p><p> <strong>  Or any other put off that will cut short the 30 minute comprehensive presentation you had planned. </strong></p><p> Most sales reps respond to these objection-like receptions by asking if they would prefer to set another time.  That response might be appropriate with the first put off &ndash; the &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a good time,&rdquo; &ndash; but with any of the others, I have a better technique for you.</p><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.  </strong> First, when you get this kind of response from a prospect you qualified a week or so ago, don&rsquo;t be surprised!  Face it: it&rsquo;s a law in all sales &ndash; Leads Never Get Better!  If you sent out the hottest lead ever, a &ldquo;10&rdquo; on a scale of 1 &ndash; 10, then when you call them back, have you ever noticed that now they&rsquo;re about a &ldquo;7&rdquo;? </p><p> And of course since most sales reps don&rsquo;t qualify thoroughly enough, most of the leads they stuff into their pipeline are made up of sixes and sevens.  And you can imagine how they are when reps reach them.  So expect that your leads are going to drop in interest and receptiveness when you call them back, and then be prepared with a best practice approach to handling them.  Here&rsquo;s what to do:</p><p> Whenever a prospect responds to your call to do a presentation with one of the responses above &ndash; the &ldquo;How long will this take?&rdquo; &ndash; kind of response, don&rsquo;t offer to call them back later, rather, get them to reveal their true level of interest to you and get them to tell you exactly how to pitch them to get the deal.  Here are a number of statements you can use to do just that:</p><p> <strong>  Responses: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Sure, I can take as long or little as you need.  Let&rsquo;s do this: why don&rsquo;t you tell me the top three things you were hoping to learn about this, and I&rsquo;ll drill right down and cover those areas for you.  What&rsquo;s number one for you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Absolutely, we can do this pretty quickly.  Tell me, what would you like to know most about how this might work in your environment?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I understand, sounds like I caught you at a bad time.  Let&rsquo;s do this: If you needed to see or learn just one thing about this to determine if it might actually work for you, what would that be?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;No problem.  Our presentation is pretty in depth, but I can do this.  Go ahead and tell me two things that are absolute deal breakers for you, and I&rsquo;ll see if we pass the test.  And then if we do, we&rsquo;ll schedule some more time later to go into detail on how the rest works, fair enough?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;In ten minutes, I can show you some things that will help you determine whether or not you&rsquo;d like to spend more time with me later.  In the meantime, let me ask you &ndash; what would you need to see the most to say yes to this?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I understand, we&rsquo;re all busy.  Let me just ask you: has anything changed from when we last spoke?&rdquo;  (Now REALLY listen&hellip;)</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Tell you what: let&rsquo;s reschedule something for later when you have more time, but in the ten minutes we do have, let me ask you some questions to determine wh ether this would still be a good fit for you&hellip;&rdquo;  (Now thoroughly re-qualify your prospect)</p><p> <strong>  As you can see, the responses above are all aimed at getting your prospect to reveal to you both their level of interest and what it is going to take to sell them &ndash; or whether or not they are still a good prospect for you. </strong> Have some fun with these; customize them to fit your personality or the personality of the person you&rsquo;re speaking with.  Find your favorites and then, as always, practice, drill and rehearse until they become your automatic response when your prospect tells you they don&rsquo;t have time for your presentation.  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 14:38:27.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 14:38:27.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_rdPO1tw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-things-to-say-when-prospects-dont-have-the-time-for-your-presentation/\", \"post_id\": \"6507\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 14:38:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 14:38:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-things-to-say-when-prospects-dont-have-the-time-for-your-presentation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6506\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"2995\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1443641998979-d59cfcf800c4.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"368\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444070700,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

I recall when I first discovered Pinterest in around 2010 (not sure if I recall the time correctly), there were so many Chinese ecommerce sites revamp their look and feel to look alike Pinterest. <br/> <br/> A few years since then, Pinterest has received much success in attracting traffic. The highly product and image oriented design makes Pinterest one of the best digital media to drive product focus referral. And data from BI Intelligence shows much a lot of traffic from Pinterest in 2014. BI provided sample data from Etsy:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-04-at-8.33.02-AM-2.png\" width=\"556\"/></p><p> BI Intelligence Report Traffic Source from Social Media <br/> <br/> When it comes to which social networks drive the most shoppers to e-commerce sites, Facebook is the clear leader; the social networking giant drove 67% of all socially referred e-commerce traffic last year, according to SimiliarWeb. However, when we look at where Etsy&rsquo;s traffic comes from, we see that Pinterest is also a major referrer. <br/> <br/> Pinterest drove 31% of socially referred traffic to Etsy in 2014, but only 7.5% of socially referred traffic to all e-commerce sites collectively, according to SimiliarWeb.  Meanwhile, Facebook drove 35% of socially referred traffic to Etsy last year. <br/> <br/> This suggests that Etsy sellers should have a presence on Pinterest, and marketers and agencies that work with Etsy sellers should be advising them to allocate ad spending for Pinterest.

One thing that we know for sure is that what used to work, doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. One of the biggest game changers in SEO over the years has been  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-content-marketing-and-how-does-it-benefit-advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing  </a> </u> .

It was understood that search crawlers looked for keywords in website content and that it was most effective to use those keywords in titles, meta-descriptions and the first 100 words of an article. Content was created and those keywords were inserted in all the right places. If you were an Advisor that was early to market, and there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of competition around your keywords, chances are you would see some success. Traditional SEO focused more on trying to rank high using target keywords and less on trying to fulfill the needs and requirements of the people using these keywords to make searches.</p><p> SEO used to be a strategy that was fairly easy to take advantage of. It didn&rsquo;t take rocket science to trick Google into ranking a poorly put together website high on their search results page.</p><p> But then&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Online competition increased, consumer awareness improved, and in came the new SEO. </strong></p><p> Unlike old SEO strategies, the new SEO puts focus on value, quality and engagement. Keyword research has become far less important than good content marketing and creation. Today&rsquo;s SEO is in large part a combination of creating and sharing great content. It has become about communicating with your current and future customers without trying to promote your Advisor services, a method of helping your prospects by teaching instead of selling. If you are creating valuable content focused on questions and topics that are relevant to your business and your client&rsquo;s and prospect&rsquo;s interests and challenges, they should naturally contain the keywords for which you want to rank.</p><p> Google is now looking for more active engagement with your site&rsquo;s content. This is why unique and valuable content is more effective then ever. High quality content offers Advisor&rsquo;s clients and prospects unique and applicable information that they can engage with, like and share. If more people are liking and sharing your content, you have a better chance of getting ranked higher in search engines than if you were to solely target the &lsquo;&rsquo;right&rsquo;&rsquo; keywords.  Additionally, creating high quality and unique traffic helps to drive more <u>  t  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/blogging-tips-for-financial-advisors-the-top-3-reasons-why-every-advisor-should-be-blogging-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   raffic to your website, drives client engagement and leads, and has a long-term effect for your web presence  </a> </u> .</p><p> So, what are two of the most important things Advisors should be doing to get results?</p><li> <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/blogging-tips-for-financial-advisors-the-top-3-reasons-why-every-advisor-should-be-blogging-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blog, blog blog  </u>  !  </a> The new SEO is all about great content.

Nowadays, the younger generation wants to be a part of a business that puts emphasis not only on the bottom line but also on its impact on society and the environment. <strong>  This could prove to be a problem when turning toward millennials for leadership within the company. </strong></p><p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-wef-2015-millennial-survey-executivesummary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Deloitte&rsquo;s most recent report  </a> </u> , it was cited that millennials have a more &ldquo;socially focused&rdquo; perception of leadership. They prioritize an employee&rsquo;s well-being and their contributions to local communities over financial gain. So how can you find true leadership amongst idealistic millennials?</p><h3> Leaders Are Purpose Driven</h3><p> <br/> Leadership requires a strong commitment to values and ethics. Going above and beyond the company&rsquo;s mission statement, true leaders are great at seeing the bigger picture.</p><p> These types of trailblazers lead by example. This, in turn, creates an atmosphere of trust, honesty, and inspiration among employees. In Deloitte&rsquo;s report, most millennials believed that a true leader should be inspirational, decisive, passionate, enthusiastic, and a visionary. This sounds like a lot to ask for, but it's the only way to sustain growth and have open and clear lines of communication.</p><h3> Leaders Have Superb Emotional Intelligence</h3><p> <br/> Leadership sometimes involves fixing mistakes. Through a genuine desire to help others, true leaders tactfully approach a problem without reprimanding.</p><p> Employees who feel respected will take heed of any feedback if they feel valued. Instead of seeing an employee&rsquo;s bad behavior as an indication that they are just inherently bad, true leaders attempt to understand what led to this behavior and respond in a direct and respectful manner.</p><p> Usually, a domineering approach to leading breeds resentment, not inspiration. Managers should be looking for millennials that are self-aware, motivated, empathetic, and possess strong social skills.</p><h3> Leaders Are Transparent</h3><p> <br/> Nothing ticks off employees more than a leader who can't justify or be held accountable for their actions. Like a parent to a child, if a leader delegates a task to an employee with a &ldquo;because I said so&rdquo; approach, then the trust and respect are lost.</p><p> Delegating tasks should involve comprehensively analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of an employee and explaining this perspective when assigning a task. Once employees develop a sense of achievement for completing said project, they feel satisfied and feel more confident in taking on new responsibilities.</p><p> Managers should be on the lookout for millennials in the workplace that will push and drive organizations to innovate while making a positive impact on society. When looking towards the younger generation for leadership, the top skills that managers should be looking for are a strong sense of purpose, a high IQ and EQ, and a staunch track record of transparency.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 17:47:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 17:47:30.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_zcbzwJh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-spot-leadership-potential-in-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"6520\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 17:47:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 17:47:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-spot-leadership-potential-in-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6519\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3000\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-04-at-10.52.15-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"460\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444046400,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2914,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Developing Employees into Brand Ambassadors, Building Up Your Brand","link":"developing-employees-into-brand-ambassadors-building-up-your-brand","source_link":null,"content":"<p> A company&rsquo;s brand is undeniably one of its greatest assets, and some of the best-managed companies of the world devote considerable resources to their brand management. A strong brand makes a difference in the marketplace and can separate your company from the competition.</p><h3> Strong brands, regardless of the actual size of the company, take time to make, as well as effort to perfect and maintain.  </h3><p> <br/> To ensure the brand&rsquo;s growth, companies need to invest time and resources into increasing their brand&rsquo;s awareness and interest among present and potential customers, improving customer communication across all available channels, and optimizing positioning of the brand in the marketplace. In order to achieve these and other similar branding goals, many companies concentrate their efforts on outbound advertising strategies and campaigns that usually do not offer any sort of success guarantee. Additionally, social media proliferation, as well as numerous machinations and scandals that have surfaced in almost every industry, have weakened consumer trust in many brands and turned multiple consumers into skeptics when it comes to advertising and company PR.</p><p> An alternative to conventional outward-focused marketing strategies exists. This alternative is much more cost-effective and budget-friendly, and involves using your employees as your brand ambassadors. It is no secret that consumers trust others like themselves more than high-ranked company executives or celebrities who are paid to promote the brand. Many companies make the mistake of overlooking this precious source of their brand&rsquo;s strength, and don&rsquo;t realize that their most powerful brand advocates are already working for the company.</p><p> Consider this:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.edelman.com/2015-edelman-trust-barometer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Edelman Trust Barometer  </a> </u> , an annual global credibility survey of 30,000+ people, showed in 2012 that in the eyes of consumers,  <u>  regular company employees have more credibility than companies&rsquo; highly ranked executives </u> . In 2013, this finding was confirmed as 41% of respondents stated that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.edelman.com/insights/intellectual-property/trust-2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employees are the most honest (?) source of information about the business  </a> </u> . In 2014, the study corroborated the point yet again, as it showed that while the  <u>  trust in company leadership plateaued </u> , trust into a regular company employee, AKA &ldquo;a person like yourself,&rdquo; increased significantly since 2009.</p><p> The importance of employee involvement in brand advocacy cannot be overestimated; trusted, staunch brand ambassadors are the key to a powerful brand. To develop their own in-house brand ambassadors, companies must first certify that the employees are engaged, contented and devoted to the company and its brand. If these conditions are not met, any effort to convert employees into brand ambassadors will prove futile &ndash; and could possibly do more damage than good to the company.</p><h3> Bottom line: Employees need to be comfortable with and empowered by their knowledge about the brand. Only when brand ambassadors sincerely believe in the brand can they do it justice.</h3><p> <br/> Although few companies have recognized the possibilities and taken advantage of engaging their employees to advocate for the brand, that number has been steadily growing. Not surprisingly, some of the most successful companies in the world rely on their employees to promote and strengthen their brand:</p><li> <strong>  Starbucks not only offers its employees an appealing benefits package </strong> , it also invests a considerable share of the company&rsquo;s budget into educating and training their baristas. The company provides obligatory funding to improve employee qualifications while they are working for Starbucks or engaged in various community projects. Starbucks takes good care with helping employees learn more about the brand and company values, because it understands that in return its employees will take care of the company.</li><li> <strong>  Adobe &ndash; with its 334.820 Twitter followers, 256,569 Facebook followers, 30,356 Instagram followers and 11,000 YouTube subscribers </strong> &ndash; knows the value of their employees as brand ambassadors. More Adobe employees share information about the company and its products on Twitter than any other brand in the world, which is reflected in the fact that 20% of Adobes subscriptions are generated through social media platforms.</li><li> <strong>  Dell has established a Social Media and Community University </strong> with the single purpose of turning 110,000 + of its employees into trustworthy brand ambassadors.</li><li> <strong>  Nokia gives its employees unprecedented freedom when it comes to social media interactions and involvement. </strong> As a result of its brand ambassadors&rsquo; online communications with the brand followers, Nokia is recognized as one of the most visible, sociable and approachable global brands today.</li><li> <strong>  Zappos also encourages its employees&rsquo; brand advocacy </strong> ; in fact, the company places great emphasis on the corporate culture and employee engagement as a means of developing great brand ambassadors. Engaged and empowered employees are more than eager to reach out to Zappos&rsquo; consumers, business partners and vendors on the company&rsquo;s behalf and help deliver the brand&rsquo;s messages. <br/>  </li><p> To fully take advantage of the benefits that employee engagement in the company&rsquo;s branding efforts may yield, managers need to find the best approach &ndash; or a combination of selected approaches &ndash; to help employees reach their peak potential as brand ambassadors. Here are a few suggestions that can help you do just that:</p><li> <strong>  Make sure your employees know the brand&rsquo;s story. </strong> For employees to significantly help the company&rsquo;s marketing efforts as brand ambassadors, they need to know exactly what it is that they are promoting. Take time to teach your employees about what you do and why it is different or unique; remember, a brand is only as strong as its advocates are empowered and dedicated. The more they understand, the more passionate they will become and the more they will spread the word about your brand.</li><li> <strong>  Encourage social media advocacy. </strong> In today&rsquo;s marketplace, not taking advantage of what social media has to offer is equal to forfeiting the game in which consumer loyalty and spending is the prize. Social media is the fastest way to reach your consumers; an active Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Google + or YouTube account is a must for any company that strives to succeed in engaging with its target audience. One account can only do so much for the company; however, imagine the extent to which this effect can be magnified if the brand messages were channeled through tens or thousands of personal accounts of the brand ambassadors.</li><li> <strong>  Learn more about your staff. </strong> What interests them? What do they like to do? What are their aspirations, values, ideas and concerns? The more interest you take in your employees, and the more you reach out to them, the more they will become interested in the company and your brand. Show your employees that each and every one of them is critical for the company&rsquo;s success; employees need to feel valued and taken care of in order to confidently and enthusiastically advocate for the brand that stands behind them.</li><li> <strong>  Invest in the company culture and take time to develop a mission and/or value statement. </strong>  Employees are more likely to champion the brand when its values are clearly defined and resonate with them on a personal level. A positive company culture facilitates employee motivation, commitment and engagement, and all three of these qualities are always present in successful brand ambassadors. Communicate with your employees, update them, involve them in the decision-making processes &ndash; only through communication can you give them the sense of direction necessary for making progress. Employees who work in an environment in which they can grow, develop and feel connected to their work are more likely to represent the company in social situations and spread positive messages about the brand.</li><li> <strong>  Ask employees what they need. </strong> Seek to understand what they need to learn, and then provide them with that learning. Not everyone is a networking rock-star or a social media guru; in fact, most employees may need some form of training to become better brand ambassadors. Follow Dell&rsquo;s or Adobe&rsquo;s example and don&rsquo;t skimp on the necessary cost for employee education; it will pay off tenfold in the future. Support, nurture and celebrate your employees as diligently as you do your brand &ndash; every little sign of acknowledgement matters; explicitly let them know that they are all &ldquo;faces&rdquo; of your company that represent your brand. Give them the information, resources and time necessary to comfortably grow into a role of a brand ambassador. Brand ambassadors are proud of their brand; give your employees something to be proud of!</li>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 17:56:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 17:56:33.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_3E0x7iL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/developing-employees-into-brand-ambassadors-building-up-your-brand/\", \"post_id\": \"6522\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 17:56:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 17:56:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"developing-employees-into-brand-ambassadors-building-up-your-brand\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6521\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3001\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1443745029291-d5c27bc0b562.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"442\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444053600,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

In preparing for that meeting, you ask yourself, \"Where do I start?\"  You know there will likely be a number of issues between parents and children, among the children, and perhaps between the parents.   <strong>  You think, \"I'm not an expert in any of these areas.\" </strong></p><p> Your concern is well placed.</p><li> <strong>  If statistics are accurate, transferring a business to the next generation is no easy feat.  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/family-business-succession-planning-where-start#Reference1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1  </a>    </strong>  Raise the bar one notch higher to transferring a business successfully--a standard we define as the company is successful five years after the parent leaves it and the transfer produces no lawsuits or family feuds--even fewer businesses make the cut.</li><li> <strong>  There is a thriving cottage industry consisting of various advisors and organizations dedicated to working with family-owned businesses. </strong>  Many books have been written on the dynamics of family business succession planning.  There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of advisors who specialize in family business representation and dozens of family business centers dedicated to the success of family businesses throughout the United States.  These organizations and advisors are dedicated to helping these businesses and business transitions focus on family relationships, communication among family members, the creation of family councils, family retreats, and a multitude of other tools and services.</li><li> <strong>  You likely are not an expert in family dynamics--and don't want to be. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Our View and Experience</h3><p> <br/> Advisors do not need to be experts in any aspect of family businesses to help owners develop a successful ownership transition plan.  They do need to be well versed in helping those owners develop and implement an Exit Plan based on their goals and aspirations.</p><h3> What About Frank?</h3><p> <br/> We recommend that you begin the Exit Planning process with Frank as you do with all owners:  ascertaining his goals.  In family-transfer planning, however, there is a twist.  We've found that it is counter-productive to engage in the planning process without the early involvement of both parents/spouses/owners.  So call Frank and ask him to bring his spouse to your meeting!</p><p> Ideally both parties should be at the initial meeting with you as well as subsequent meetings involving goal determination and design of the Exit Plan.  The reason is simple:  each party wears three different hats, and each has multiple roles.</p><p> <strong>  Role 1.  Parent: </strong>  \"I want to treat each child equally\" may conflict with</p><p> <strong>  Role 2.  Owner: </strong>  \"A child should be rewarded with ownership based upon their contributions to the business,\" which may conflict with </p><p> <strong>  Role 3.  Spouse: </strong>  \"Frank needs to slow down and get a life outside the business.\"</p><p> Goal setting in family-business succession planning must encompass business-, owner- and family-goals.  If the owners/parents/spouses do not first agree on their goals and subsequently communicate those goals to the children, the planning process grinds to a halt.  The parents' understanding of what they want and need must be the lodestar for all planning.  It provides direction for family discussions and decision-making.  It doesn't, however, provide answers to every issue that arises, just the framework within which discussions take place.</p><p> The emphasis on the owner's goals and objectives as the driving force behind family-business succession planning does not ignore intra-family issues that can delay or doom a successful outcome.  On the contrary, almost all owners have as a principal goal the creation or continuation of family harmony based upon fair treatment of all children.  It is up to Frank and his wife, not their children or anyone else, to determine what is fair.  This determination directly relates to how best to achieve all of their goals and aspirations.</p><p> In subsequent articles we will describe how this approach leads to the creation of specific recommendations on transferring ownership to the next generation.</p>188% of current family business owners believe the same family or families will control their business in five years, but succession statistics undermine this belief.  Only about 30% of family business survive into the second generation. <a href=\"http://www.familybusinessinstitute.com/index.php/Succession-Planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.familybusinessinstitute.com/index.php/Succession-Planning/</a>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 18:07:06.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 18:07:06.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_bcOxjcX.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/family-business-succession-planning-where-to-start/\", \"post_id\": \"6524\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 18:07:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 18:07:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"family-business-succession-planning-where-to-start\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6523\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3002\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-04-at-11.13.13-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"390\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444050000,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

It happens to every single one of us every day. So, how do you thrive through the scrutiny?</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t react</h3><p> <br/> First of all, don&rsquo;t take it personally and don&rsquo;t react impulsively. When you are being scrutinized it says more about the other person than it does about you. While you have no control over the thoughts and actions of others, you can control your own attitude, emotions, words, and actions. Stop your first reaction; don&rsquo;t lash out and never argue; I promise it is pointless. Be mindful of your internal and external reactions. If you feel you must respond, reply with a simply say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; if there is merit to the scrutiny or simply say &ldquo;I disagree and there is nothing further to discuss&rdquo;.</p><h3> Choose your attitude</h3><p> <br/> You are in control of your own attitude, choose it wisely. First, don&rsquo;t play the victim. Show you are confident but not arrogant. When you feel that you are being scrutinized, it is important that you give yourself credit; what did you do right? What are you good at? While you don&rsquo;t need to justify your behavior, you don&rsquo;t want to become angry or defensive either. It&rsquo;s good to acknowledge how the scrutiny makes you feel, but keep your attitude positive.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t over think it</h3><p> <br/> Consider &lsquo;who&rsquo; is scrutinizing you. Is it someone you trust? Is it an advisor or a friend? Once you identify the role this person plays in your life, then you can seek to understand their intention. Is there any validity to it? Was it given to hurt or the help? But, don&rsquo;t over think it. Listen to what is being said and what is not being said. Then, simply ask yourself &ldquo;does it make sense?&rdquo; If you aren&rsquo;t sure how to answer that question, get a second opinion.</p><h3> Is there a lesson</h3><p> <br/> You can turn scrutiny into opportunity if you look for the lesson to be learned. Take responsibility for what is true; take what is helpful and discard the rest. Is there something you can learn? Is there an ongoing issue? Be open-minded and try to make it a learning moment; even if it&rsquo;s only learning to control how you respond to scrutiny. Use scrutiny as an opportunity to invest time in yourself to become the best you can be.</p><h3> It doesn&rsquo;t define you</h3><p> <br/> And, the most important way to thrive through scrutiny is by not letting it define you. Remember that no one is perfect. Don&rsquo;t let the thoughts and actions of others determine the way you see yourself. You are of value regardless of what anyone else has to say.</p><h3> You Might as Well be Doing Something</h3><p> <br/> As Heather Locklear said in her quote, you might as well be doing something while you&rsquo;re being scrutinized. So, what can you be doing? You can be exercising control over your attitude, emotions, words, and actions. You can be evaluating who is scrutinizing you and what the intentions are behind their scrutiny. You can be determining if there is a valid lesson to be learned. You can be defining yourself on your terms. And, here&rsquo;s the biggest tip for thriving through scrutiny: everything outlined above should take all of 30 seconds of your time. Then, hold your head high and move on!!!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-04 18:16:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-04 18:16:59.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_46QEIM7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/thriving-through-scrutiny/\", \"post_id\": \"6526\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-04 18:16:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-04 18:16:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"thriving-through-scrutiny\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6525\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3003\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-04-at-11.24.54-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"535\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444068000,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

While learning to fly the helicopter I discovered that the cause of imbalance is more about what you are not doing than what you are doing.  In this article I share how  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/am-i-a-workaholic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  achieving balance for life </a>  is like learning to fly the helicopter. These principles became apparent as I attempted to take the controls of a helicopter for the very first time.</p><h3> Helicopter Training</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the controls.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the voice of my flight instructor in my headset.  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/the-blessing-of-brokeness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Learning to fly a helicopter </a>  is not impossible -- it just seemed that way to me.</p><p> It was Day-One of flight training for my Private Helicopter License. I was in Chandler, Arizona at Rotorway International for my training. My instructor was Stretch. Stretch was in his 60's and had over 6,000 hours logged flying Rotorway helicopters. He was also a little short on patience but long on wisdom. </p><p> As we lifted off, my instructor put us into a perfect, motionless hover (using all your skill to go exactly nowhere), I realized how important balance is when it comes to keeping a helicopter right-side up.</p><p> For an ecstatic couple of seconds, I think I&rsquo;m in control. After all, I&rsquo;m already one hour into my first lesson. How difficult can it possibly be to keep this little egg-beater upright?</p><p> Then the hover begins to decay and the machines starts to saucer. We drift from side to side, pitching and rolling, lurching forward, sliding back, rising and falling like a hat in the wind.</p><p> Every correction I made only amplified my previous mistake. After a couple of seconds, I hear Stretch's calm voice in the head-set -- &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo;</p><p> Almost before he finishes speaking, we become level and motionless and poised for whatever he wants to do next.</p><p> \"What am I doing wrong?' I asked.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sense of balance you&rsquo;re missing,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;you need to imagine you are balancing yourself on top of a beach ball.&rdquo;</p><p> His next words were \"Ben, you are chasing balance. That never works. You must make the correct adjustments and let balance come to you. It's that simple!\"</p><p> You are waiting too long before making your corrections. You've got to correct as soon as you feel the slightest imbalance.​ The sooner you correct, the less you need to correct.</p><p> ​What an eye-opener! Those few words of wisdom opened up a whole new perception of what life balance is all about.</p><p> Here are the 7 lessons about life balance I learned from Stretch's words of wisdom:</p><li> <strong>  You don't need balance if you're not going anywhere in life. </strong> The bigger your dreams, the more important balance is going to be.</li><li> <strong>  You only discover imbalance as you pick up speed. </strong> As long as move slow enough, balance is not a big deal. </li><li> <strong>  The faster you move the better balanced you need to be.  </strong></li><li> <strong>  The sooner you realize that you are out of balance </strong> , the smaller your corrections need to be.</li><li> <strong>  It's called a sense of balance for a reason. </strong> You can feel imbalance coming on long before it's visible.</li><li> <strong>  Doing less doesn't bring balance </strong> , it brings inactivity. Instead of burnout, you rust out.</li><li> <strong>  Great mission requires regular maintenance </strong> . Mission without maintenance leads to burnout. You must land and rest in order to do maintenance.</li><p> <br/> I now have a new appreciation for the word balance. To maintain  <u>  <a href=\"http://succeedwithoutburnout.com/17-strategies-to-overcome-burnout-and-achieve-balance-for-life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   balance in life  </a> </u>  is much like maintaining balance in a helicopter, it requires small adjustments as you begin to feel the shifts in balance, long before you are able to see them.</p><p> When I was suffering through my burnout experience the most common advice I received was that I was doing too many things. The truth was 'there was too many things I wasn't doing.'</p><p> I was advised that was ​I was severely over-committed.

{"original_id":2919,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Things That Changed Sales Forever","link":"3-things-that-changed-sales-forever","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Looking back over my 27-year career, I can say without a doubt, Google and search changed sales forever, and I am so glad!</h3><p> <br/> My first sales job was in 1989. I was sent to classes like &ldquo;How to cold call,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Getting past the gatekeepers.&rdquo; I spent hours each day making calls to try and set appointments so I could go out and educate prospects on our services. We were taught it was a numbers game and if you made enough calls each day, you would make a certain number of appointments and close a certain number of sales. It worked. I became one of our top sales people. But change was coming.</p><h3> Search</h3><p> <br/> The first change came in September 1994, when the consumer was given the equivalence of fire! Google was founded and search was born. It didn&rsquo;t take long before the balance of power shifted to the new, empowered consumer. They could search for information and be fully prepared before they even came in contact with a sales person. They didn&rsquo;t need someone to tell them what a product or service did. They had already Googled it. Soon they could scan and compare products and prices. They could place orders without ever needing to contact sales.</p><p> Consumers began to behave differently. They&rsquo;ve stopped answering their phones. They no longer make the time to meet with sales people. They build online relationships faster and trust their friends and social networks to give them straight answers.</p><h3> Social Media</h3><p> <br/> Social media was the other game changer. When someone searches for information, often the answers that appear in search results are from social media sites. The comments of the community and the posts from the brands on social media will rise to the top of search, many times higher than the company website.</p><p> As much as you might despise review sites like Yelp, or Trip Advisor, consumers love them. Consumers value and depend upon the feedback from other consumers to make their purchasing decisions. You will have to stop ignoring these sites and learn to change the way you do business. If you have employees, you will need to train everyone to know that customers are social and every interaction will be tweeted about, Yelped, Instagrammed or put on YouTube! Today we are not just being watched by Big Brother; today it is every one of Big Brothers friends, cousins and neighbors who have mobile phones.</p><h3> Mobile Technology</h3><p> <br/> The increased use of mobile phones is the third thing that has changed sales forever. Some of us remember the beginning of mobile devices in the mainstream. The busy professional carried their brick phone or had their car phone to make calls on the go, but in June 2007, the world saw the first iPhone and suddenly everyone was carrying a mobile device. Even Grandma and Grandpa now carry a device that connects them to the world like nothing they had ever experienced. Consumers watch video reviews of products, ask Google or SIRI for information and it is delivered in seconds.</p><p> So what are you to do? If you were starting in sales today, you would focus on content creation instead of getting past the gatekeeper; how to listen and engage with potential consumers instead of probing and closing. You would build your websites to allow searchers on their mobile devices find your key information without having to stretch or scroll too much. You would create video content to allow your consumers to meet you on their device before you ever know their name.</p><p> Businesses today must learn to begin building and nurturing relationships where the consumer is&hellip;online&hellip;on social media sites&hellip;on their mobile devices. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we never meet face-to-face, it simply means we won&rsquo;t get that opportunity until we start on their turf. Digital marketing is about building brand awareness, trust, and arming a brand&rsquo;s fans with information to allow them to educate themselves while we are building those relationships.</p><p> We must learn to create content on our websites, blogs, and social media accounts that will match with what consumers are searching for when they &ldquo;Google&rdquo; their questions or when they ask SIRI.</p><p> If we will start thinking like our customers, we will start finding new ways to connect and provide helpful information. We will stop trying to interrupt their workday with our sales calls and make sure our content is there when they go looking.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 17:21:05.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 17:21:05.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_fdPBE9T.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-things-that-changed-sales-forever/\", \"post_id\": \"6533\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 17:21:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 17:21:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-things-that-changed-sales-forever\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6532\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3006\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/love-social-media-700x467.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"432\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444473900,"author_id":185,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2920,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Should You Take Social Security or Retirement Plan Payments First","link":"should-you-take-social-security-or-retirement-plan-payments-first","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In the complex field of social security retirement income maximization planning, a general rule of thumb is that you can increase your benefits by delaying the start of those benefits. <strong>  From age 62 to 70, your benefit amount will increase by approximately 8% per year. </strong> In addition, any cost of living adjustments (COLA) applicable during that period will also increase your benefit amount. <br/> <br/> In spite of these facts, <strong>  approximately 40% of retirees elect to take their benefits at age 62 and nearly 70% take their benefits prior to full retirement age (which is 66 for current retirees). </strong> The reasons for filing early vary from the need to take money as early as possible, poor health, or the inability to continue to work. <br/> <br/> In addition, the conventional thinking regarding retirement plan (eg. IRA's and 401K's) distributions is that one should delay withdrawals as long as possible in order to preserve and grow your retirement nest egg. As such, by filing for social security benefits early one could postpone withdrawals on retirement plans, at least until age 70 1/2 when required minimum distributions would commence. <br/> <br/> However, this may not be the the optimal \"draw down\" strategy from a tax minimization perspective, as well as for many other reasons. In fact, in most cases, <strong>  social security should probably be treated as the most prized retirement dollars that people should try to enhance. </strong> Unlike other retirement assets, social security offers a combination of inflation-fighting COLA, longevity protection, investment risk elimination, spousal and divorced spousal benefits, survivor benefits and children's benefits. <br/> <br/> From a tax minimization perspective, it may also be more beneficial to draw down on retirement assets first, allowing for increases in social security benefits. This strategy may appear to be counter-intuitive but, in many cases, social security payments may qualify for much lower effective income tax rates than income provided by liquidating traditional retirement accounts. <br/> <br/> Although traditional retirement accounts allow for tax-deferred investment growth, all distributions are treated as ordinary income and taxed at the recipient's highest marginal tax rate. Social security payments, by contrast, enjoy substantial exemptions from Federal income taxes. <br/> <br/> To calculate the amount of your social security payments subject to tax, you must calculate your \"Provisional Income\". The latter is the sum of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) + one-half of your social security benefits + tax-exempt income. If this combined income is less than $32,000 for a couple ($25,000 if single) then your social security payments are totally free of Federal income tax. Starting at these levels, 50% of social security benefits will be taxable, rising to a high of 85% for incomes above $34,000 (single) and $44,000 (joint filers). However, no more than 85% of social security benefits are subject to tax no matter how high your income is. <br/> <br/> As such, albeit in an extreme example, if the only income a couple had was from social security then that couple would pay no income taxes on their combined social security income of up to $64,000!  Although this is a highly unlikely scenario, it does demonstrate the advantageous tax treatment of social security benefits. Even the wealthiest tax payers should take note of the fact that the maximum amount of social security benefits that they are required to include in income is 85% versus 100% for ordinary income investments. <br/> <br/> Since taxable retirement account income increases a person's AGI, and thus may boost their tax rate on social security benefits, by spending down IRA balances early in order to defer taking social security, people are not only trading a dollar of high-tax retirement income for a dollar of lower-taxed social security, they are also reducing their future tax bite on social security benefits in the process. <br/> <br/> Therefore, the conventional wisdom of taking income from your tax-deferred savings accounts as late as possible may not always be the best nor the most tax-efficient retirement income strategy when examined in combination with social security benefits. Since the latter offers significant tax benefits for most tax filers, the optimal retirement income strategy should take this into account.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 17:32:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 17:32:47.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_g2Y5dnw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/should-you-take-social-security-or-retirement-plan-payments-first/\", \"post_id\": \"6535\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 17:32:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 17:32:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"should-you-take-social-security-or-retirement-plan-payments-first\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6534\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3007\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444065381814-865dc9da92c0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"584\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444136400,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}

Realise I might get comments about the relevance / irrelevance of Klout, but the fact of the matter is having a Social presence is now seen as important in the job market.  Klout is a way to measure progress and is sometimes used by employers.</p><h3> How To Twitter For Business Success, Nicky Kriel</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-14-at-14-20-32.png\"/></p><p> Nicky&rsquo;s book has for me, become the best book on Twitter I know.  Realise that sometimes these books can look like text books, but Nicky&rsquo;s writing style is very easy.  was lucky enough to meet her last year and I can vouce that she is excellent counsel on good practice for Twitter, she is also a generally nice person.Nicky is heavily involved in bringing Social Media and Twitter to the masses, she undertakes training for Small Businesses, Sole Traders etc.</p><h3> How to Really use LinkedIn, Bert Verdonck</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-14-at-14-27-13.png\"/></p><p> While there are many &ldquo;top 10&Prime; articles on how to use LinkedIn, Bert&rsquo;s books covers all of the angles.  If you are going to run a Social Selling / Employee Advocacy program you need to read this book.  Similar to Nicky above, I&rsquo;ve met Bert and he is what I would call &ldquo;great value for money&rdquo;.</p><h3> The Social Executive: How to Master Social Media and Why its Good for Business Dionne Lew</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-14-at-14-34-59.png\"/></p><p> Dionne is very brave at covering the subject of why CEO or more importantly, people in the C-Suite should use or at least understand Social Media.  Dionne&rsquo;s writing style is to research the subject (some would say obsessively) but that means you always get facts and statistics to back up any hypothesis she puts forward.  If you do buy a copy of this book, may I suggest you buy two copies and give one to your manager.Met Dionne when she came over to the UK in 2014, she is passionate about educating the C-Suite and getting them engaged in Social.  Expect more in this area.</p><h3> Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers, Geoffrey A. Moore</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-14-at-14-43-26.png\"/></p><p> Have successfully taken three new products to market using the concepts in this book.  If you follow the steps laid down in this book and you shouldn&rsquo;t fail.</p><h3> In Search of Excellence, Thomas J.

Techniques are still used and I&rsquo;ve seen them advocated recently by companies like Google and Facebook.</p><h3> Start-Up Nation, Dan Senor and Saul Singer</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-14-at-15-06-30.png\"/></p><p> How is it that some countries can be more tech savvy than others?  Read this book on the way back from Thailand, it covers not just why Israel seems to generate many of the technology advancements we take for granted but also why you should be more confident and hold out for more money when your start-up gets purchased.</p><h3> Age of Context, Robert Scoble and Shel Israel</h3><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://timothyhughesuk.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-14-at-15-10-25.png\"/></p><p> In his role at Rackspace, Robert Scoble comes into contact with many start-ups and Disruptive technologies.

But the concepts are the same.  C-Suite suite people will give your content 7 seconds before they delete, move on or grant you another 7 seconds.  You had better offer something personalised and offer value.  You may well ask as a Social Seller, why I&rsquo;m not advocating the use of LinkedIn.

{"original_id":2922,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Fool's Gold","link":"fools-gold","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There are few investing myths as persistent as Gold.  We like the idea of something we can touch, hold in our hands.  We want to believe that there&rsquo;s an antidote to market volatility.  We like shiny things.</p><p> Gold is pure speculation.  It is gambling, pure and simple.  And if it is understood as such, go have a blast.  Try to buy at the bottom; sell or short it at the top.  Get in, get out, and good luck.</p><p> But often we hear another rationale for owning gold, one that belies a lack of understanding of basic math.  The thinking goes something like this:  We don&rsquo;t know when the market will go up or down, so we invest for the long-term.  However, gold generally goes up when the stock market is going down, so we&rsquo;ll hold some to &ldquo;hedge&rdquo; the portfolio.</p><p> This, my friends, is a contradiction.  A cognitive dissonance.  A statistical fallacy. EITHER you are investing for the long-term OR you are trying to time the market and outperform.  The latter has been proven statistically nearly impossible to do through skill, but the game is too exciting for some not to try.</p><p> Start with the assumption that the stock market will go up over a long period of time.  Therefore, you invest for the long-term and diversify.  The reason to diversify is that while everything will go up over long periods of time, not all segments of the market move in the same direction at the same time.  Diversifying helps level the path on the way up.</p><p> So why not add gold? <strong>   Because gold does not increase in value over time. </strong>   It is not a return-producing asset.  Gold is a piece of metal.  It does not create or add value.  In fact, over long periods of time, it just keeps up with inflation.  Stocks, meanwhile, represent a share in a company that produces goods and/or services.  As the company grows, the stockholders share in that growth.</p><p> From the book  Basic Economics  by Thomas Sowell, &ldquo;&hellip; a dollar invested in bonds in 1801 would be worth nearly a thousand dollars by 1998, a dollar invested in stocks that same year would be worth more than half a million dollars in real terms. Meanwhile, a dollar invested in gold in 1801 would by 1998 be worth just 78 cents.&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re creating a diversified portfolio for long-term investing,  <strong>  there is no place for an asset with zero real return. </strong>   It is not possible to create an efficient portfolio &ndash; one that maximizes expected return for its level of risk &ndash; when incorporating an asset with an expected return of zero.  It seems silly to even have to say it, but all long-term investments should have positive real expected returns.</p><p> Yes, gold often rises in price when the stock market is falling, but attempting to time the bottom and the top is fundamentally at odds with the principles of long-term investing.</p><p> What do we call an asset with high volatility and no real return?  An investment?  No.</p><p> Gold?  Yes.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 17:41:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 17:41:41.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_HzrkPjy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/fools-gold/\", \"post_id\": \"6539\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 17:41:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 17:41:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"fools-gold\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6538\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3009\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gold-dust.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"933\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444150800,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

We all have creativity inside us that we put in service to our daily life and work.</p><p> The financial advisor that pulls cherished dreams out of his clients and maps a pathway to get there.

I do every single left brain thing I can think of to prime the pump. Homework. Research.

{"original_id":2924,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Becoming a Person of Interest","link":"becoming-a-person-of-interest","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Your clients are pressed for time. Everyone wants to get on their agenda. There is competition, in a sense, to build a relationship with them. In response, you need an attraction strategy. You need to become a person of interest, someone that senior executives are drawn to spend time with.</p><p> This is not about charisma or personal flair, but rather about authenticity and value&mdash;about being an interesting person to spend time with, someone that clients feel stimulates their thinking, someone from whom they learn and get ideas!</p><p> So, what kind of person is this? First all of, you have to become a Deep Generalist. This is someone who has a well-developed core expertise&mdash;be that in an industry, function, or other niche&mdash;and who layers on top of that broad business knowledge and acumen. This enables you to have discussions with your client about their business issues&mdash;whether they&rsquo;re talking about operations, organization, or strategy&mdash;and to always put your specific solutions in the context of the overall enterprise.</p><p> This broader knowledge includes an understanding of four domains: First, your client as a person and as a professional. Second, your client&rsquo;s strategy and organization. Third, your client&rsquo;s industry. And fourth, the general business environment. Think of being fluent in your core expertise and conversational&mdash;at a minimum&mdash;on the broader business issues.</p><p> Secondly, a person of interest has interesting experiences that they are able to share and make relevant to others. You may think&mdash;&ldquo;But my experiences aren&rsquo;t very exciting. I&rsquo;ve lived in the same place, and worked with the same types of clients for years.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short! One of my clients told me the following story: A client of his asked if he would have lunch with a young, well-known Silicon Valley CEO. My client, a partner in a large accounting firm, said &ldquo;Of course I will&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not really sure what I can offer this person.&rdquo; The client was surprised, and said, &ldquo;Oh, but you have a lot of knowledge you can share with him. You&rsquo;ve seen companies go through all sorts of different phases of evolution and crisis points. You&rsquo;ve witnessed effective and ineffective leadership, and can share your observations about what makes for a good leader. You have a lot to offer.&rdquo;</p><p> A third aspect of being a person of interest is being seen as someone who knows other interesting people. You can manifest this by offering to make relevant introductions to your clients, based on your and/or your firm&rsquo;s network of contacts. Even just talking about interesting people you know&mdash;and again, being able to convey their wisdom or the things you&rsquo;ve learned from them&mdash;can be valuable for clients.</p><p> Also, <strong>  try and read more widely. </strong> <strong> </strong> Being well read provides many benefits for you: It helps you be a more interesting conversationalist, it gives you ideas for your client engagements, and it puts you in the position to recommend an interesting book or article to a client. The average American only reads a couple of books each year (and many read no books). If you can read or even skim a dozen books a year you&rsquo;ll be leagues ahead of your competition. I find the digital book explosion to be a boon for my reading capacity. I download the same book onto multiple devices, such as my iPhone and Laptop, and whether I&rsquo;m in the doctor&rsquo;s office or waiting to board a plane, I can always knock off another five pages of the book I&rsquo;m reading.</p><p> Finally, <strong>  you have to be more than just a business person. </strong> One of my own clients said to me, <strong>  &ldquo;You have to have interests to be interesting to others.&rdquo; </strong> Whether it&rsquo;s travel, reading, gardening, or a sport, indulge your interests. Of course, you don&rsquo;t do these things just because they can enhance your client relationships&mdash;although that will be one of the positive side effects.</p><p> So think about what you can do, in the next year, to add business breadth to your expert depth and become a more effective Deep Generalist. <strong>  Work to include interesting, intelligent, and ambitious people in your network. </strong> Think about your work experiences, and what you can draw out of them that would benefit current clients. Read widely and be eclectic in your choice of books and articles.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 18:07:10.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 18:07:10.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_MqYElFC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/becoming-a-person-of-interest/\", \"post_id\": \"6543\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 18:07:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 18:07:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"becoming-a-person-of-interest\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6542\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3011\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1443996264301-c81a3053d00a.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"420\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444132800,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2925,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Ways Sales Professionals Lose a Prospect","link":"6-ways-sales-professionals-lose-a-prospect","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In any profession, knowing what not to do is often as important as knowing what to do. Sales is an intensely interactive profession, which means that you have to use your eyes, ears, and brain before you use your mouth. Tone-deaf sales pitches and responses are ultimately a waste of time - yours and your prospects'. Practicing the professional sales skills that turn a lead into a customer is, of course, critical. But so is knowing what not to do. Here are some common ways sales professionals turn prospects off and jeopardize the possibility for a sale.</p><h3> Not Owning Problems</h3>People don't want to hear excuses. While it's entirely possible that the warehouse lost a shipment, you can't excuse it with your customer by telling them it's not your problem. To that customer, you're the face of the company, so it is your problem. You probably hate hearing excuses too, so instead, own the problem, offer a straightforward apology and tell the customer what you're going to do to fix it. Owning and solving problems is one of the most valuable professional sales skills.<h3> Interrupting Clients</h3>Obviously, talking is a major part of what you do, but opening your mouth before using your eyes and ears can turn a prospect into a former prospect. Strategic communications expert Steve Cody <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/steve-cody/tips-from-the-best-salespeople-ive-ever-met.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> says it perfectly</a>: \"Top salespeople know there's a reason nature equipped them with two eyes, two ears, and one mouth. They use their eyes to observe a prospect's nonverbal prompts. They open their ears to listen to what a customer does and doesn't say ... The three best salesmen I've ever met excel at looking and listening before speaking.\"<h3> Saying, \"Trust Me\" or \"To Be Honest\"</h3>These phrases do nothing for your prospect and indicate that one, you may believe others to be untrustworthy and two, you haven't been honest all along. Business consultant Joellyn Sargent <a href=\"https://www.joellynsargent.com/youre-kidding-right/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> puts it bluntly</a>, stating that whenever she hears the words \"trust me,\" it's \"an immediate alert that the next thing I will hear is a lie.\" And \"to be honest\" can make your prospect wonder what you're hiding, or what you've been hiding. Proven professional sales skills always include honesty.<h3> Applying Artificial Pressure</h3>Telling a prospect that if he or she doesn't pounce on your offer right now the deal is off the table is both desperate and ineffective. The prospects you want to turn into clients are not necessarily the ones who will give in to artificial pressure. Buyers and decision-makers with experience know that giving in to sales pressure is counterproductive, and are likely to balk if you tell them it's now or never. Your professional sales skills should not include high pressure tactics.<h3> Not Doing Your Research</h3>When you do your homework about a new prospect, you not only learn how your product or service can help them, you save both parties time. While there is nothing wrong with asking more questions from a prospect to draw a more accurate bead on what you can do for them, you shouldn't open a conversation asking what it is they do. You're supposed to know something about your prospects so you can determine if you can do business together in an efficient manner.<h3> Making It About You and Not Them</h3>Ultimately, the mistakes listed above are ways sales professionals make the sales process about them, rather than about the customer. Pressuring a potential customer, questioning their decision-making skills, interrupting them, or making excuses for a problem after the sale shows them that the process isn't about what's in it for them, but about what's in it for you. And that's a sure way to turn a warm prospect cold. Professional sales skills that work are ultimately about the good of the customer.<h3> Conclusion:Don't Tell Me What's In It For You</h3>Sales professionals need a solution-oriented approach to selling that puts the customer and the customer's needs front and center. Solution-oriented sales skills are what consultative sales skills are all about. <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> CSC</a> offers consultative sales certification coaching in a comprehensive program. Not only do sales professionals work on core competencies, they receive individual coaching and better still, apply the skills they learn in their work. The result is professionals who develop opportunities to build up skills that need improvement, and who polish their strong skills so they can deliver measurable improvement in their sales effectiveness.

{"original_id":2926,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Ways To Repurpose Old Content","link":"8-ways-to-repurpose-old-content","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Before we launch into repurposing tactics, let&rsquo;s get a few things straight. First, repurposing content is not lazy writing; it&rsquo;s smart marketing! Not only are you lowering content costs and production time, but you&rsquo;re also cross-promoting different types of content across multiple channels to reach new audiences and capitalizing / expanding upon hot topics that your audience wants to read about in greater depth. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/04/frequency-repetition-and-the-power-of-saying-it-more-than-once.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketing Genius Seth Godin  </a> </u>  points out: &ldquo;Delivering your message in different ways, over time, not only increases retention and impact, but it gives you the chance to describe what you&rsquo;re doing from several angles.&rdquo;</p><p> Secondly, repurposing content is not a practice reserved for small, cash-strapped brands only. Sure, in some cases, you can get more mileage out of your blog by taking a couple minutes to re-post on social media or blast the message out to your email subscribers &mdash; and it doesn&rsquo;t cost you another copywriting dollar. However, in other cases, it&rsquo;s worth re-investing to transcribe old content to a new medium to reach more prospects.   <u>  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/64949-three-brands-that-show-the-value-of-content-repurposing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top brands like Marvel Comics, Disney and Red Bull  </a> </u>  are all doing it &mdash; and so should you! </p><p> Thirdly, repurposing content is not a stale, ineffective tactic that only serves to repeat the same tired message to the same audience. Even your most dedicated fans will miss a post or a message somewhere along the line. Consider this: in one case study,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/email-marketing-repurpose-existing-content?utm_content=bufferc0088&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketing Sherpa  </a> </u>  found that repurposing content from prior email campaigns helped Evo, an outdoor lifestyle product retailer, increase email open rates by 160 percent and click-through rates by 904 percent! To get these fantastic results, the Evo team borrowed from past posts to create helpful email guide series aimed at specific target markets. For instance, they had a three-part &ldquo;Ski Boot Guide&rdquo; series that included an instructional video on how to try on ski boots, an article on how to customize boots to get a better fit, and information on ski boot accessories like ski socks and liners &mdash; with helpful links to buy, of course!</p><p> <a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/repurpose-blog-post.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"37 ways to repurpose a blog post\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/repurpose-blog-post.png\"/> </a></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"https://contentequalsmoney.com/37-ways-to-repurpose-a-blog-post-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ContentEqualsMoney.com  </a> </u></p><p> So now that we&rsquo;re on the same page and totally clear on the value of breathing new life into old content, here are eight ways you might do just that:</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%238Ways+To+Repurpose+Old+Content&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-repurpose-old-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   #8Ways To Repurpose Old Content  </u> </a></p><h3> 1. Create a &ldquo;resource list&rdquo; on your website, a &ldquo;guide&rdquo; blog post or an email series.</h3><p> <br/> If you have a ton of content on a particular niche, then it&rsquo;s time to start consolidating! You can create an &ldquo;Ultimate List of ______ Resources&rdquo; on your website with links to all your old posts. This tactic not only gives your audience an easy, concise directory to help them find everything they need, but it also improves SEO for your website! These pages also tend to get a ton of shares via social media, so don&rsquo;t forget to share your new page on your micro-sites as well.</p><p> We find that many of the topics we discuss cannot be adequately explored in just 500 or even 1,000 words. It then stands to reason that a provided link can take information-hungry readers to longer discussions. To best achieve this goal, you can create a &ldquo;Guide To ________&rdquo; that summarizes the main points discussed in other blogs and provides links to more in-depth discussion.</p><p> Like Evo, you can consolidate different types of content for a particular audience to provide the right message at the right time to help move consumers along the sales cycle through an email series. With your CRM software, identify people who are in the early stages of browsing your site and send them Part 1 of your email &ldquo;Guide To Buying _______&rdquo; with trust-building content. From there, automate the next parts of the series to provide more information and help consumers choose the product (or service) that is right for them.</p><h3> 2. Turn old blogs into an eBook.</h3><p> <br/> EBooks are not the cheapest form of marketing, as they could possibly take up a lot of time to fill out in book form. However, in some cases, each blog can serve as a chapter of your eBook and the only additional writing needed is an introduction and conclusion to tie everything together. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/repurpose-blog-content-ebook-ht\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HubSpot  </a> </u>  points out, you want to choose topics that have resonated well with audiences in the past. You&rsquo;ll also need to invest a bit of time into making the eBook attractive-looking and user-friendly for your readers. Once your eBook is finished, you can then sell it for a profit or use it as a valuable giveaway to build your targeted subscriber list (which will often translate to a large increase in sales!)</p><p> Hey, speaking of eBooks,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/ebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you can find our FREE eBook on generating quality leads online here!  </a> </u></p><h3> 3. Turn a blog post into something visual.</h3><p> <br/> Not everyone shares a love of reading. Some people are blog readers, while others may be more interested in perusing a graphic or slideshow. It&rsquo;s been said that people generally only remember about 20% of what they read, but retain about 83%of what they learn visually. So by translating blogs to more visual mediums, you&rsquo;re not only reaching new audiences, but you&rsquo;re driving your points home and remaining fresh in the minds of people you may have already reached as well.</p><li> Make an infographic with stats from a past blog.  <u>  <a href=\"http://piktochart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Piktochart  </a> </u>  is a neat tool to create them.</li><li> Convert blogs into power point presentations or PDFs by uploading them to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Slideshare  </a> </u>  for free.</li><li> Create a video using points from your blog using  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomteicholz/2015/08/24/wibbitz-is-cutting-edge-automated-video-creation-for-publishers/\" target=\"_blank\">   Wibbitz  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"https://animoto.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Animoto  </a> </u> . <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Share an old blog post on social media&hellip; again.</h3><p> <br/> Everyone knows that social media is the ideal repurposing machine. However, most brands just tweet their blogs once when they first come out. They worry that posting the same blog again will be a turn-off to fans and look redundant in their feeds. What business owners tend to forget is that their reality is not the same as their prospects&rsquo; reality. People are busy and consumed with their daily lives, bombarded with different stimuli from all angles. It takes a considerable amount of poking and prodding to connect with the same person twice.</p><p> You may or may not have noticed, but we often repurpose the same blog in our social media feeds &mdash; in fact, we&rsquo;ll post the same blog an average of 7 times on Twitter, three times on Facebook and twice on Google+. We space them appropriately and post at different times of the day to reach new audiences and we&rsquo;ve found this tactic is very effective at reaching a larger audience and ensuring a longer lifespan for our most useful and evergreen content.</p><p> You might like:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-steps-solid-social-media-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 Steps to a Solid Social Media Strategy  </a> </u></p><h3> 5. Bring the outside world online.</h3><p> <br/> Digital marketing does not need to exist in the vacuum of cyberspace. There are so many methods of marketing a business online that businesses often overlook connecting offline realities with their online marketing efforts. One way we&rsquo;ve seen clients effectively bridge the gap is by posting &ldquo;behind-the-scenes&rdquo; videos from their day-to-day operations. This type of content  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/video-marketing/6-ways-to-execute-an-ecommerce-video-strategy-to-increase-your-sales-01243038\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   resonates particularly well  </a> </u>  with buyers.</p><p> Other ways to bring the offline world online include:</p><p> &ndash; Videos from street marketing promotions or tradeshow events to showcase what you sell or what you do</p><p> &ndash; Public speaking engagements uploaded to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Slideshare  </a> </u></p><p> &ndash; Public speaking events translated into blogs using a free program like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.freemake.com/blog/how-to-turn-speech-into-text-document-free-with-voicebase/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Voicebase  </a> </u></p><p> &ndash; Public speaking event turned into  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rightmixmarketing.com/webinars-and-public-speaking/how-to-do-webinar-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a webinar  </a> </u>  and used as an opt-in to draw more subscribers</p><h3> 6. Use social media feedback as a springboard for new content. </h3><p> <br/> Have you had interesting dialogues with clients, prospects or consumers via social media recently? Are common questions popping up? Social media can be an ideal source of blog-worthy topics. Another approach would be to host a contest on social media that asks fans to submit photos or stories associated with your products or services to win a prize and use that information in a future blog or press release (after receiving permission from fans, of course!)

Turn a blog post into a podcast.</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s a Tweetable statistic: Did you know that, in 2015, 46 million Americans over the age of 12 are listening to podcasts every month? That&rsquo;s 17% of the population! This percentage has increased 5% in just two years. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://maximizesocialbusiness.com/whos-listening-podcasts-2015-18213/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MaximizeSocialBusiness.com  </a> </u> , 10% of the population listens to podcasts on a weekly basis, listening to an average of six shows per week. These people are generally young (12-34), intelligent (24% college-educated), affluent (twice as likely to make $100K/year) and extremely active on social media (56% use it at least once a day, if not more).</p><p> If those aren&rsquo;t compelling reasons to convert old blog posts to podcasts, then we don&rsquo;t know what is! There are many ways to approach the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of podcasting.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.blogtyrant.com/how-to-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BlogTyrant  </a> </u>  breaks down the step-by-step process if you&rsquo;re looking to really knock it out of the park. If you want to do a little experimenting and get something up quickly with minimal effort, try out the free  <u>  Podcastomatic conversion tool </u> . In recent years, Twitter has made it pretty easy to  <u>  <a href=\"http://kimgarst.com/how-to-use-twitters-new-audio-cards-for-business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   share podcasts  </a> </u>  through their platform, so be sure to take advantage of that!</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%23DYK%3A+In+2015%2C+46+million+Americans+over+the+age+of+12+are+listening+to+podcasts+every+month%3F&amp;via=mandymodgirl&amp;related=mandymodgirl&amp;url=http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-ways-repurpose-old-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   #DYK: In 2015, 46 million Americans over the age of 12 are listening to podcasts every month?  </u> </a></p><h3> 8. Break down your list posts.</h3><p> <br/> As we&rsquo;ve mentioned, you can turn past posts into lists&hellip; but you can also work backward and break your lists down into individual posts! For  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our other blog at Mod Girl Marketing  </a> </u> , we often expound on some of the finer points glossed over in the 8 Ways blog.

But quite often, she discovers this possibility after the fact, when it&rsquo;s too late.</p><p> So how can a woman take precaution when facing a dissolution of marriage?</p><p> <strong>  Here are 3 important steps to prepare for divorce: </strong></p><h3> Step #1 &ndash; Document Your Assets &ndash; start a file for gathering important financial records that you will need during the settlement negotiation process. Compile the following documents: <br/>  </h3><li> Tax returns and other tax documents such as W2s</li><li> Any legal documents such as contracts or business documents</li><li> List of your personal valuables such as jewelry, furniture, art and other collectibles</li><li> List of contents of your safety deposit box and home safe</li><li> Financial documents such as: <li>  Bank statements </li> <li>  Retirement account statements </li> <li>  Annuity statements </li> <li>  Social Security statements </li> <li>  Mortgage documents </li> <li>  Life insurance policies </li> <li>  Brokerage account statements </li> <li>  Beneficiary forms </li> <li>  Trust, wills and healthcare documents </li> <li>  Automobile titles  <br/>    </li></li><p> Once you have your financial documents together, meet with your professional financial team (accountant, attorney, insurance agent and financial advisor) to discuss pertinent things you should know BEFORE you enter into divorce negotiations.</p><h3> Step #2 &ndash; Know Your Social Security Benefits</h3><p> <br/> As a former spouse, you may be entitled to Social Security benefits based on a worker&rsquo;s account if you were married for at least ten years, as long as you are not currently (re)married.</p><p> This is great news if your ex-spouse&rsquo;s income was a lot higher than yours.</p><p> Claiming ex-spousal benefits does not diminish your ex-spouse&rsquo;s (or their new spouse&rsquo;s) benefits.</p><p> This can be accomplished confidentially; your ex-spouse does not need to know. However, you will need your ex-spouse&rsquo;s Social Security number.</p><p> As the claiming ex-spouse, you will be able to receive your ex-spouse&rsquo;s benefit (most likely a portion thereof), or your own at any given time (once you qualify), but not both simultaneously.</p><p> Apparently, there are 567 ways to collect Social Security benefits, yet only 18% of recipients are planning to maximize benefits, according to an article on Bankrate.com.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/financing/retirement/567-ways-to-collect-social-security/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   (Source)  </a> </u></p><p> Even if you&rsquo;re a long ways out from claiming SS benefits, gather the information you will need now and keep them in a safe place, such as a safety deposit box. At the very least, keep a copy of your ex-spouse&rsquo;s Social Security statement, their Social Security number and a copy of your marriage certificate. You&rsquo;ll also need a copy of the final divorce decree.</p><p> Do your due diligence and get educated about everything you&rsquo;re entitled to, including Social Security ex-spousal benefits. I strongly encourage you to consult your tax advisor, attorney, financial advisor and Social Security representative.</p><h3> Step # 3 &ndash; Perform a Beneficiary Audit</h3><p>  </p><p> I highly recommend periodically reviewing beneficiary designations. But it&rsquo;s even more important when going through a divorce, because beneficiary designations override the will.</p><p> Meet with your financial professional(s) to review:</p><li> IRAs, 401Ks and other qualified plans</li><li> Nonqualified annuities and life insurance policies (including employer sponsored policies) <br/>  </li><p> You&rsquo;ll also need to reconsider other legal documents, such as power of attorney, health care directives and will &amp; trust documents.</p><p> Obviously, this is not an entire divorce preparation list. But it&rsquo;s enough to give you a strong foundation for getting your finances in order, before the outcome of the final divorce decree.</p><p> The bottom line is that you&rsquo;ll basically be starting over financially. So, get your ducks in a row as soon as you know you are dissolving your marriage. Even if you&rsquo;re just separating, and not divorcing, it would behoove you to prepare for what may come. That way you won&rsquo;t encounter any surprises. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve been there myself, and I&rsquo;ve heard horror stories about what spouses tend to do to one another during separation. I&rsquo;m sure you have too.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t watch your back, no one else will. Now, more than ever, you need to stand up for, and protect, your financial wellbeing.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 18:32:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 18:32:53.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_kkjGXaM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/women-money-3-steps-to-prepare-for-divorce/\", \"post_id\": \"6551\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 18:32:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 18:32:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"women-money-3-steps-to-prepare-for-divorce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6550\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3015\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1443734276910-ba691f3f7f79-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"595\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444489200,"author_id":375,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2930,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Young Couples Should Know About Debt","link":"what-young-couples-should-know-about-debt","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Young families often acquire a large amount of debt from unpaid student loans, car payments and credit card usage. Things get worse financially, when they add in the responsibilities of starting a family. If you are a young adult who is yet to find a high-paying job or cannot afford to have his own home or car and constantly struggling with his family debt burden, then make a move right away. Financial planning and an effective debt management plan can always help you in this regard and can save you from crumbling under harrowing debts. Read on, to know about the financial fiasco which you must evade in order to attain a debt free life ahead. These following preconceived notions of young families are mainly responsible for their financial disaster and debt chaos in future so make sure you avoid them strictly.</p><h3> &lsquo;Professional help is not required&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> Young families with debt, especially those who have children, should consider meeting a financial planner to put their finances in order. A financial planner not only set a proper budget for you but also advises you to invest your money for the best possible returns. With a financial planner there to guide you, you can easily set your financial priorities. Saving for a home must be the top priority amongst all. They might suggest you to make a college fund for your kids and a rainy day fund for unexpected emergency crisis. Only a certified and reputed financial planner can guide you the best and can help you to meet your financial targets.</p><h3> &lsquo;What is so wrong with a little credit card Debt?&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> The greatest financial blunder a family makes is carrying too many credit cards and their huge credit card bills. It is particularly difficult to mitigate and manage credit card debts because they have the highest rate of interest which is more than 17 %. Being inexperienced, young families often commit the mistake of making the minimum monthly credit card payments. What they fail to understand is if they continue to do this it will take them more than a decade to pay off the entire balance. Ideally, they should attempt to make at least $100 more than the minimum payment on each credit card account. Young and yet to be settled families should strive to use cash instead of card as much as possible and in case family members face difficulty controlling their use of credit cards, they should look for assistance from a licensed credit counselor regarding in this regard.</p><h3> &lsquo;Fly without a Budget&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> A close kin to any debt issue is poor budgeting. Young couples tend to overspend mostly because they often underestimate their expenses. The problem originates from their flawed spending habit which is to spend first and then plan to save the amount left. Unfortunately enough, after spending incessantly there is hardly any amount left at the end of the month. As a remedy to this problem make a frugal budget keeping in mind all your daily expenses and saving plans and follow it sincerely.</p><h3> &lsquo;Retirement is Far Away&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> Many young couples just don&rsquo;t decipher the significance of saving for retirement and skip investing in their 401k retirement plans or IRAs. As these youngest wage earners are under a misconception, that retirement is a long way away from them, they prefer to focus on short-term goals, like buying a new car and fail to contribute for long time investment like retirement plan. Those who invest at least 15 percent of their income in retirement savings consistently from an early age remain far ahead financially after retirement than those who don&rsquo;t.</p><p> Keep in mind the above mentioned points and avoid repeating these mistakes in future. Steer your financial life to the right direction as soon as possible.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 18:42:45.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 18:42:45.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_ebpUywS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-young-couples-should-know-about-debt/\", \"post_id\": \"6557\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 18:42:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 18:42:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-young-couples-should-know-about-debt\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6556\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3017\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1416348316427-9ebac5dfef01-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"657\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444158000,"author_id":282,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2931,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"36 Questions to Ask Your Partner","link":"36-questions-to-ask-your-partner","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Science of People  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Do you know your partner? </strong></p><p> I mean, do you really, truly, deeply know who they are as a person?</p><p> I&rsquo;m a victim of the How Trap. The How Trap is when you know how someone is&ndash;because you ask what they are doing, what they have been up to and follow them on social media, but you don&rsquo;t ever get to ask the deeper questions. Put simply:</p><p> I don&rsquo;t want to know just how you are. I want to know who you are.</p><p> Sometimes we feel like we really know someone, but on the surface we are only familiar with the day-to-day. For example, when my husband and I get really busy, we can go days without asking any questions beyond logistics-type questions. We see each other at the end of the day and ask &ldquo;How was your day?&rdquo; and we go through what we did and what happened. We talk about plans for the weekend and updates from friends we saw on Facebook.</p><p> The other day, I had this big AHA moment. I realized that we were talking, but we weren&rsquo;t sharing.</p><p> I think this happens for couples, friendships and especially parents and their kids. We get so wrapped up in the day-to-day that we are lucky to get to the &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo; but we very rarely get to the &lsquo;who are you?&rsquo; Especially when you have known someone for a long time, we forget to ask how they have changed. We let the deeper questions fade away.</p><h3> The Science of Intimacy:</h3><p> <br/> Psychology Professor Dan McAdams has studied what it takes to truly know someone. He believes there are &ldquo;three levels of knowing&rdquo; and that these are the 3 stages people progress through to become intimate friends, lovers or companions.</p><li> <strong>  Level 1: General Traits In this level </strong> , you get to know someone&rsquo;s general personality traits, specifically where they fall on the Big 5 spectrum: how high or low they are in Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. See our overview of the  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/04/how-to-optimize-your-personality/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   personality traits here  </u>  . </a></li><li> <strong>  Level 2: Personal Concerns </strong>  This is where someone gets to know a person&rsquo;s goals, values and motivations. They also get a broader picture of the decisions and attitudes that shape their life.</li><li> <strong>  Level 3: Self-Narrative Lastly </strong> , when you truly know someone, you know the stories they tell themselves about themselves&ndash;how they have made sense of their journey and purpose through life. <br/>  </li><p> The question is: How do you move through these 3 levels? Level 1 is easy&ndash;typical conversation can help you with this. Level 2 can happen naturally as you live with someone, travel with someone and have shared experiences. But Level 3 can only be done purposefully&ndash;with the right questions in a safe space. This brings me to the 36 couple questions.</p><h3> The 36 Questions:</h3><p> <br/> Social psychology researcher Arthur Aron of the Interpersonal Relationships Lab at Stony Brook University in New York developed 36 questions to help people break through each of the intimacy levels. You can do these with your partner or with friends. I highly recommend them to parents and teens. Keep in mind:</p><li> <strong>  Vulnerability brings people closer.  </strong> The point of these questions is to have sustained, escalating and reciprocal self-disclosure. Take time having both people answer the questions and truly listen to the answers without judgement.</li><li> <strong>  There is no such thing as rapid intimacy. </strong>  I would NOT recommend doing these all in one sitting. One per dinner perhaps or one per car ride. Take your time, savor them, expand on them and see where they take you. One of my friends and I answer one of these each week. <br/>  </li><p> Ok, here are the questions for you. Feel free to print these out or email them to a friend.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/7fZV0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tweet these to someone special in your life!  </a>    </u></p><p> 1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</p><p> 2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?</p><p> 3. Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you&rsquo;re going to say? Why?</p><p> 4. What would constitute a perfect day for you?</p><p> 5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?</p><p> 6. If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose?</p><p> 7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?</p><p> 8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.</p><p> 9. For what in your life do you feel most grateful?</p><p> 10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?</p><p> 11. Take four minutes and tell you partner your life story in as much detail as possible.</p><p> 12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be?</p><p> 13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?</p><p> 14. Is there something that you&rsquo;ve dreamt of doing for a long time? Why haven&rsquo;t you done it?</p><p> 15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?</p><p> 16. What do you value most in a friendship?</p><p> 17. What is your most treasured memory?</p><p> 18. What is your most terrible memory?</p><p> 19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?</p><p> 20. What does friendship mean to you?</p><p> 21. What roles do love and affection play in your life?</p><p> 22. Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items.</p><p> 23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people&rsquo;s?</p><p> 24. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?</p><p> 25. Make three true &ldquo;we&rdquo; statements each. For instance, &ldquo;we are both in this room feeling&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> 26. Complete this sentence: &ldquo;I wish I had someone with whom I could share&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> 27. If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know.</p><p> 28. Tell your partner what you like about them: be honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you&rsquo;ve just met.</p><p> 29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life.</p><p> 30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?</p><p> 31. Tell your partner something that you like about them already.</p><p> 32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?</p><p> 33. If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven&rsquo;t you told them yet?</p><p> 34. Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/animal-behavior\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  pets </a> , you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why?</p><p> 35. Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why?</p><p> 36.

The enormous amount of time, energy and resources spent developing a business can make the idea of giving up control hard, and the process can be an emotional roller coaster.</p><h3> The key to conquering those emotions is preparation.</h3><p> <br/> Just like starting with the smaller roller coaster before riding the large one with the big drop, there are many steps you can take to prepare yourself for what is to come</p><h3> 1. Establish your Motive</h3><p> Make a list of reasons why you are selling your business. Outline the possible opportunities that could result from the sale. Share this list with employees, family members and friends and seek their feedback. Keep this list with you throughout the entire deal process.</p><h3> 2. Have the Right Mindset</h3><p> Make sure you are committed to the sale. Reaching the right &ldquo;Seller&rsquo;s Mindset&rdquo; is crucial if you want to find the ideal buyer. Owners that have a clear understanding of why they want to sell will be better prepared to handle the speed bumps that can come during the sale process.</p><h3> 3. Accept that Changes will Come</h3><p> After establishing why you&rsquo;re selling and what you expect the sale to bring, understand that changes will likely result from the sale &ndash; some good, some bad and some okay.</p><p> The good results are easy to point out: no more financial or personal pressure, less stress, richer personal bank account, more free time to pursue other challenges or maybe a short consulting gig or board seat before you &ldquo;ride off into the sunset&rdquo; (if you haven&rsquo;t already).</p><h3> 4. Be Prepared for a Whirlwind of Emotions</h3><p> As you near a final sale you will likely encounter emotional responses. Addressing these triggers in advance will make the process go smoother.</p><li> <strong>  Is this the right thing to do? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What about my family&rsquo;s legacy with the business? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will the new owner respect my company&rsquo;s place in our community? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do I like the new potential owners? Will my employees? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What will I do after the deal closes? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> As logical as the deal may look on paper, you may be surprised at how some of these emotional questions become paramount when the goal line is in sight. Make sure everyone involved in your business has considered these questions.</p><h3> 5. Create a Support System</h3><p> Find someone else who has gone through the sale process, and talk to them about how they got through it. This could even be your M&amp;A advisor. I built and exited four businesses on my own. I know the emotional journey a business owner undergoes when deciding to sell their company.</p><h3> 6. Give yourself a new Framework for your Goals and Aspirations</h3><p> Make it a plan to rediscover what you truly enjoy doing.Whether it&rsquo;s hobbies, volunteering, traveling, or even the work that you currently do, where there&rsquo;s a passion, there&rsquo;s a future. Find the time to explore that passion.</p><p> Getting over the emotional hurdles that business owners typically face when they sell can be challenging, but if you are well prepared it will be easier. Keep in mind, an experienced M&amp;A advisor will guide you through the emotional journey and be with you every step of the way.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 19:05:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 19:05:55.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_bhvzxKD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/conquering-the-emotional-roller-coaster-when-you-sell/\", \"post_id\": \"6561\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 19:05:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 19:05:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"conquering-the-emotional-roller-coaster-when-you-sell\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6560\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3019\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-05-at-12.14.06-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1373\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444134600,"author_id":274,"chart_url":""}

Feeling, or better yet, actually being ahead of the game? </strong> Sometimes trying to get on top of all your day-to-day business realities seems futile at best. At the end of the day you may feel more like a firefighter and less like a business owner or leader, managing the emergencies that occur even on the most &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; days. All this reacting can make you feel like you&rsquo;re merely surviving instead of thriving. When in survival mode things like strategic planning and creatively mending patterns of breakdown experiences fall by the wayside. In the madness of trying to stay above water, proactive thinking just doesn&rsquo;t happen. Well let&rsquo;s take a breath and at least consider the importance of positioning product passion into our businesses.</p><p> Principle 1 in my book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071801251/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071801251&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themichexpe-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leading the Starbucks Way  </a> </u>  is Savor and Elevate. Can you imagine how different our lives would be if most business owners worked to infuse product passion into their entire workforce? What if those owners also believed it was their job to improve or elevate the products that they touch? How would your next visit to your dry cleaner, post office, electronics store, or supermarket be different? Better yet, imagine how your customers might feel if all your people were passionate about your products and felt responsible for elevating them with each touch.</p><p> It comes as no surprise that constantly reacting to your environment and circumstances is draining.</p><h3> But connecting your people to passion for your product or service is a life force.</h3><p> <br/> When we are passionate about something we not only find energy but we delight in sharing our enthusiasm with others.</p><p> What is one way that Starbucks works to foster this savor-and-elevate spirit, a spirit of passion if you will, into their culture? Rituals. For some people, the word ritual tends to conjure up images of religious or personal behavior; however, S. Chris Edmonds, a senior consultant with the Ken Blanchard Companies and co-author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137011709/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0137011709&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themichexpe-20%22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leading at a Higher Level  </a> </u> , defines corporate rituals &ldquo;as events which communicate and reinforce desired performance and values.&rdquo; Chris believes, &ldquo;Few senior leaders leverage corporate rituals as an intentional strategy to define and reinforce a company&rsquo;s desired culture.&rdquo;</p><h3> Corporate rituals are powerful ways to create a common bond, inspire commitment and innovation, and build an integrated and effective culture. </h3><p> <br/> Authentic corporate rituals also define unique aspects of your culture and reinforce your business&rsquo;s broader purpose, particularly when those rituals are supported by enriched experiential learning and congruent business strategy.</p><p> At Starbucks a powerful corporate ritual involves starting meetings with coffee tastings &ndash; it celebrates coffee and communicates that coffee is at the center of the brand. It drives a constant exploration into the nuances of the rich palate of coffee offerings at the company. Unless you are selling coffee that particular ritual will not be relevant to you. What can you do to create a pattern of behaviors that define and reinforce your company&rsquo;s desired culture and proactively connect your people to a passion for your products or services?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-05 19:24:00.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-05 19:24:00.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_Xv5W1JU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/if-you-dont-have-passion-for-your-product-why-should-your-customer/\", \"post_id\": \"6563\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-05 19:24:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-05 19:24:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"if-you-dont-have-passion-for-your-product-why-should-your-customer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6562\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3020\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444012830796-83db7e1db0d3.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"440\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444157100,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

But robo-advisors can represent an opportunity for you to improve the way you serve your clients, according to Richard Heft, executive director of Ext. Marketing Inc. in Toronto. </strong></p><p> The term \"robo\" may sound intimidating, because it brings to mind images of machines replacing human advisors. But the term is misleading, according to Heft.</p><p> \"Robo-advisors are really portfolio management systems,\" Heft says. \"And portfolio managers have been using various types of technology for years now. They are becoming a growing part of the industry.\"</p><p> <strong>  Here are three ways robo-advisors can help you: </strong></p><h3> 1. Improved time management</h3><p> You might use robo-advisors to manage the accounts of clients who need less hands-on financial planning and advice.</p><p> For example, millennials, who are in the accumulation stage of their lives, may require less personal advice than older, more affluent clients, Heft says. And millennials often are more comfortable working with technology and the web than older clients.</p><p> Using robo-advisors to manage some clients' portfolios can free you up to spend more time with clients who have accumulated larger assets and may need more personal advice on issues such as retirement planning and estate planning.</p><p> Millennials represent the future of the industry, so you still should work with them in developing a financial plan. Robo-advisors give you the option of providing more or less active management for these clients, depending on their individual needs.</p><h3> 2. Client education</h3><p> Take an open and transparent approach when explaining the benefits of robo-advisors in conjunction with your practice, Heft advises. Clients will see you as being more trustworthy than someone who might dismiss robo-advisors altogether.</p><p> The use of robo-advisors can be regarded as a diversification strategy, Heft says. You might even consider hosting presentations in which you explain various types of asset classes and investment styles in the context of robo-advisors.</p><p> \"In the post-CRM2 era,\" Heft says, \"any discussion is a good discussion.\"</p><h3> 3. Demonstrating your value</h3><p> Clients will always need the soft skills of a human advisor.</p><p> <strong>  \"Advisors have been proven to prevent investors from making emotional investment decisions in times of market volatility,\" Heft says. \"A person who relies solely on technology may make more knee-jerk decisions that could affect their long-term ability to meet their savings needs.\" </strong></p><p> For example, the Value of Advice Report by the Investment Funds Institute of Canada indicates that households that use an advisor are 1.5 times more likely to maintain a long-term investment strategy than those that do not have an advisor.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 14:49:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 14:49:24.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_aaI78K8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-robo-advisors-can-help-your-practice/\", \"post_id\": \"6565\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 14:49:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 14:49:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-robo-advisors-can-help-your-practice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6564\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3021\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-06-at-7.57.34-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"579\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444219200,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2935,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Steps to Successful Strategic Alliances","link":"10-steps-to-successful-strategic-alliances","source_link":null,"content":"<p>Business growth doesn&rsquo;t come from wishful thinking. As you know, it takes a lot of hard work. The growth of your business is not an option &ndash; it is a necessity. Coordinating the right mix of strategies to gain market share and improve client acquisition rates is essential to advance your firm in today&rsquo;s economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many advisors share a common thread of business development initiatives: referral campaigns, capturing new assets from existing clients, and forming strategic alliances with other professional teams. During difficult market times, uniting with attorneys, insurance agents, CPAs, and other professionals is one of the best investments you can make for your firm. While cost and skill sharing are notable reasons to form an alliance, an association with suitable partners will extend the depth of your team and provide a means to offer clients a full spectrum of services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is a Strategic Alliance?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure alliances are truly successful for your firm, you must understand what they are and more importantly what they aren&rsquo;t. A strategic alliance is an agreement between two or more parties to pursue a set of agreed upon objectives while remaining independent organizations.&sup1; Often advisors attempt to organize informal alliances and merely hope a reciprocal referral pattern will fall into place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Picture this &ndash; it may sound like a familiar situation to you: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You invite a potential alliance to lunch and spend time chitchatting about your firm. You talk about your shared niche market(s) and try to persuade them to understand how your firm is different from the competitor down the street. You end up having a nice lunch and agree to refer clients to one another over a hand shake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heading back to your office, you reflect on your meeting and give yourself a pat on the back &ndash; thinking you have formed a solid strategic alliance that will provide a flow of referrals to your firm. You may even go so far as to start referring clients to their company. But something happens; you notice you&rsquo;re not procuring a significant level, if any at all, of qualified referrals in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why and how does this happen?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s simple; you have formed an informal arrangement that doesn&rsquo;t represent a true strategic alliance. An unorganized plan that lacks an imperative reason for others to provide referrals will fall short of your desired result.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strategic Alliances &mdash; Where to Start</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Advisors who take the time to invest in building strategic alliances generate higher revenues and profits. Done correctly, it only takes a small number of strategic partners to have a positive impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begin to structure your extended team with other professionals whose efforts are symmetrical with the needs of your clients. Identify professionals that share your niche market and can provide solutions for your clients beyond your existing realm of services. Measure the value of a potential partnership by assessing the quality of solutions you can provide for your client&rsquo;s problems, needs, and wants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brainstorm! You can form alliances with a host of different professionals; get creative and explore your opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Alliance Partners</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Strategic-Alliance-Image.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Strategic Alliances for Financial Advisors\" src=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Strategic-Alliance-Image.png\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strategic Alliances = Long-Term Success</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic alliances will help catalyze your firm&rsquo;s growth because they empower each partner to serve clients better. Through the alliance, your clients benefit from the expertise of trusted professionals and feel satisfied knowing you are working together as a team to help them achieve their financial goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A successful alliance is a formal affiliation between two parties that creates a vested interest to help the other grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a study performed by CEG Worldwide, it is noted that referrals from other professionals are a key source of new clients for 81.9% of today&rsquo;s top financial advisors.&sup2;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Referrals-From-Strategic-Alliances.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Referrals From Strategic Alliances\" src=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Referrals-From-Strategic-Alliances.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nYour affiliation is a formalized, ongoing relationship that encompasses a distinct set of responsibilities committed to by both companies. Commitment from both parties provides the foundation for a deep routed, profitable relationship for all involved. At the core of your affiliation is a set of bona fide benefits to each partner involved &ndash; most often in the form of added value to clients and specialized expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Strategic Alliances</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>- Business Growth</li>\r\n\t<li>- Increased Revenue</li>\r\n\t<li>- Additional Value for Clients</li>\r\n\t<li>- New Introductions and Referrals</li>\r\n\t<li>- Enhance Your Value Proposition</li>\r\n\t<li>- Offering More Specialized Services</li>\r\n\t<li>- Skill Sharing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Follow the 10-Step Process</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1: Identify Potential Partners</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Often financial advisors choose to work with professionals that clients have already secured for outside services. Expand beyond this inner circle and explore other firms that focus on people in your niche market. Start by making a list of the top three local attorney, CPA, and insurance firms in your area. Identify potential partners through Google searches, LinkedIn profiles, city information, and any other resources you have access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose counterparts that you can easily collaborate with, develop good connections, and those that will actively introduce you to new clients rather than waiting for an opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2: Research Potential Partners</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Gather data and research your potential alliances. Your goal in this step is to support your position that a strategic alliance with this firm will be mutually beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 3: Make the First Call</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a tough economy where all professionals are feeling the crunch, everyone can use extra help with business development. Contact your selected alliance prospects and schedule an appointment to discuss opportunities for working together. Tell them you will share data about your mutual niche market, how to market to them, and the most effective way to earn their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 4: The First Meeting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your goal in this step is to determine suitability to form an alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Talk about the potential alliance </strong> , the benefits of working together, and the opportunity for revenue sharing.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Share the information you gathered earlier about your mutual niche market </strong> , how to market to them, and the most effective way to earn their business. This will support your case for forming an alliance and position you as an industry expert and influencer.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Provide specific details regarding expectations </strong> and what each firm will do to uphold a mutual commitment for your partnership.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Evaluate and gain a better understanding of your potential alliance. </strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make a mutual decision. </strong> If you determine working together will benefit all parties involved, your clients and each firm, schedule your next appointment to finalize your agreement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 5: Identify Specific Opportunities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Brainstorm about every opportunity to work together. Focus on core interests and business themes you have in common. Discuss objectives, obstacles, and expectations for your future relationship. Determine what your alliance should accomplish over the next 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 6: Establish Revenue/Profit Goals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine ideal and minimum revenue and/or profit goals for your alliance. Your ideal goal should represent the revenue and new assets under management it will take to make the program a success. The minimum goal is what must be achieved in order to continue the partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 7: Develop an Agenda</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Create an agenda that includes any event or campaign you plan to execute with your strategic alliance over the next 12 months. Identify the goal for each item, the strategy you will use to obtain results, when the event will take place, and who will be responsible for implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While creating your strategy, include the following best practices to ensure your partnership is effective and creates an opportunity for new clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 8: Present the Plan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Schedule a meeting with your potential alliance to present your plan. Review your opportunities, strategy, and the specific steps you will take to reach your goal. Discuss profit and revenue goals as well as expenses. Look for any gaps in your initial plan and make necessary modifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 9: Commitment and Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon mutual agreement, make a commitment and implement your plan. Identify team members who will act as a point person to ensure implementation takes place as scheduled.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 10: Analyze and Follow Up</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Continually refer back to your alliance plan to monitor and celebrate successes and make changes when you find something isn&rsquo;t working. You can have the most brilliant plan in the world, but it will do no good if it isn&rsquo;t implemented and followed up on regularly.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 15:05:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 15:05:34.000000","image_url":"10-steps-to-successful-strategic-alliances.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-steps-to-successful-strategic-alliances/\", \"post_id\": \"6567\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 15:05:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 15:05:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-steps-to-successful-strategic-alliances\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6566\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3022\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444093826349-9ce8c622f4f3-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"4596\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":29134,"author_id":346,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2936,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Simple Business Model that's Easy to Understand – Really!!","link":"a-simple-business-model-thats-easy-to-understand-really","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Startups frequently develop from excellent ideas, enthusiasm, uniqueness, and energy, but oftentimes lack the proper understanding or programs that will make money.  </strong> In the 3,000-plus startups and small businesses that I&rsquo;ve mentored over the years, execution is frequently the biggest challenge.  I have developed a pretty &ldquo;spot-on&rdquo; (and flexible) simple business model that quickly establishes a number of &ldquo;base projections&rdquo; (aka, early stats of profits and losses) for startup and small businesses. The key unique features are that the model is simple, customized, and dynamic. For example, it allows you to compare the impact of different marketing, pricing, and cost alternatives in one model.  And, while the system is designed for businesses that will have limited capital and a need to show profits in a short period, it can be used to test concepts for larger, long term efforts. These larger businesses typically rely on exponential growth and potential rather than short-term profits to raise capital and increase valuation.</p><p> <strong>  Though it can be customized, the model simply requires inputting estimates of the following parameters: </strong></p><li> The sales volume goals.</li><li> The average selling price by product and distribution channel.</li><li> The cost to produce one unit.</li><li> The marketing costs to achieve the desired volume.</li><li> The costs for labor and administrative functions.</li><li> The profit over different time frames. <br/>  </li><p> I integrate these estimates into a simple, customized, and flexible model.  The model provides an evaluation of alternatives, an understanding of what drives sales and profits, and ways to develop effective strategies to modify estimates in order to develop a more viable business.</p><p> It also avoids the complexity of many accounting-based models by using general industry standards for expenses and keeping the focus on the basics. For example, the accounting models frequently include detailed financials with wrong assumptions, and endless lists of expenses like phone charges, and transportation which are generally insignificant and also difficult to estimate.</p><p> I have developed and tested 50 or so templates which can be used for different businesses and which focus on variables like multiple products, distribution channels, marketing efforts, cost structures, and selling direct (Amazon versus your own web site).  We then customize the template with input from the entrepreneurs so that we can make accommodations to complete this simple customized model.  Turn-around time for this model is not months, or weeks, but typically within 2 business days.  We can do so because of the years of careful research, and particular expertise.</p><p> The following is one of my simplest examples, and one of the most useful.  It&rsquo;s tailored for entrepreneurs who bill by the hour or project. It shows how variances in &ldquo;hourly rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;hours worked,&rdquo; and other costs, affect income.  This model was extremely insightful for one of my clients who was a therapist and charged by the hour.  I suggested that she discontinue accepting insurance, thus increasing her hourly rate.  This provided the same income but with fewer hours, which then allowed her to spend more time with her family.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-06-at-8.39.54-AM.png\" width=\"616\"/></p><p> *The average hours per year:  40 hours for 48 weeks.</p><p> Example: at 1,459 hours (80%) at $150 per hour, you will earn about $218,880.*The average hours per year:  40 hours for 48 weeks.</p><p> <strong>  To summarize, I consider the model to be my secret weapon that can be used by virtually any company. </strong>    It&rsquo;s an easy to understand model that focuses on key parameters that affect sales and profit. However, the real secret is that it is also customized; I work hand in hand to help business owners understand the parameters, potential, and challenges their business faces. The system can also estimate parameters and immediately see what might work, and what might not. Finally, after a little help, the client can easily take over and modify and test any changes.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 15:38:21.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 15:38:21.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_GGXAzLe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-simple-business-model-thats-easy-to-understand-really/\", \"post_id\": \"6570\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 15:38:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 15:38:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-simple-business-model-thats-easy-to-understand-really\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6568\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3023\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444086798547-11000e647498.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"774\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444238100,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2937,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Absolute Value And Transparency","link":"absolute-value-and-transparency","source_link":null,"content":"<strong> As investment advisors, how do we add the most value for our clients?</strong>At Fiduciary Wealth Partners (FWP), this is a question we often ask ourselves.If you&rsquo;ve read some of our other pieces, you know we are big fans of index investing as compared to active management. Some active managers have added value on a relative basis as compared to their appropriate indices, but at FWP we believe the evidence consistently points to the advantages of index funds (see our <u> <a href=\"/advisor/say-it-aint-so-joe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Say It Ain&rsquo;t So, Joe </a></u> commentary on active funds versus index strategies).When we talk about how to add the maximum value for our clients, however, I don&rsquo;t think how we are performing relative to an index is the most important question.A recent article on the views of Seth Klarman, who is one of the most well-respected active investors of our time, got me thinking more about this question. Below is a link to the piece, which gives a good overview of Klarman&rsquo;s philosophy. <u> <a href=\"https://novelinvestor.com/seth-klarman-absolute-returns-risk-timing/?utm_content=buffera47e4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Absolute, Not Relative Returns </a></u>In particular, I could not agree more with the following quote:<h3>  &ldquo;The world has a relative performance orientation. If you beat the market or you beat your peers, you will gather assets, even if you lose money doing it.&rdquo;</h3>The investment business tends to attract competitive people who like to win, but in striving to be at the top of our peer group, I think the industry is too focused on relative returns.As Seth suggests, the quest to beat the market and earn a top ranking as compared to our peers can increase the assets that we manage and make us a lot of money. In doing this, though, do we lose sight of what is most important to our clients?If you really listen to what clients say, they consistently want goal-oriented advice that simplifies their lives and offers peace of mind about the financial future.The industry, however, continues to focus on the importance of having five star-ratings, spending an enormous share of its time and money promising, and selling the ability to pick a manager or strategy that can outperform an index (i.e., relative performance).Considering how hard it is to deliver on these promises, and how many resources (firm time and client fees) are spent in pursuit of something that research indicates is very elusive, I believe we should be focusing more on other things.Versus trying so hard to find and sell alpha, maybe the industry should be spending more time trying to understanding clients&rsquo; feelings about risk and reward (not presenting output from questionnaires or Monte Carlo simulations), giving full transparency (openly discussing both sides of a trade, fully disclosing all terms, potential biases and conflicts) and, importantly, making investors comfortable with their investments, so they have a greater likelihood of sticking to their plans.<h3> Where does this lead us?</h3>I believe that if more advisors used index funds, it could reduce what I think are relatively unproductive competitions to find and sell alpha.This said, humans are inherently competitive, and index funds are not for everyone (some people want to pursue the &ldquo;New New Thing&rdquo;). As I recently wrote in <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/preston-d-mcswain/whats-in-a-name/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> What&rsquo;s In A Name</a>, if investing in an active strategy or working with a large brand makes a client feel more comfortable, and will allow him or her to stick to a plan more easily then, regardless of the relative performance versus an index, these are the correct choices.<strong> Bottom line, I think the aggressive pursuit of alpha at the potential expense of greater absolute, goal oriented results should be more openly discussed.</strong>Rather than simply selling relative performance and relative risk metrics (Sharpe ratio comparisons, etc.), let&rsquo;s spend more time openly discussing both sides of topics, such as active vs. index funds, listening to what clients want to achieve, and implementing strategies that increase comfort and peace of mind.If we spent more time offering <u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/transparency-fiduciary-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Transparency </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/simplicity-wealth-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Simplicity </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/fiduciary-peace-of-mind/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Peace of Mind </a></u> (TM), I think it would increase trust in our industry as a whole and help us form more lasting partnerships with clients.Studies consistently back up this idea, finding that clients don&rsquo;t change advisors based on performance, they change advisors based on concern that their current advisor doesn&rsquo;t listen, understand and deliver what they want.<strong> Let&rsquo;s remain mindful that investing should not be a competition with others, but the means to reaching client-specific goals.</strong>If we focus on adding true, long-term, goal-oriented value in a fully transparent manner, we may come in for short-term criticism, but in the end I think we&rsquo;ll do the most good.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 15:46:59.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 15:46:59.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_mLNCDMP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/absolute-value-and-transparency/\", \"post_id\": \"6572\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 15:46:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 15:46:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"absolute-value-and-transparency\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6571\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3024\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1419843596342-f3053fb71845-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"946\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444226400,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}

Fewer than 10 put up hands.</h3><p> <br/> With the U.S. population over age 85 growing at a rapid clip, advisers increasingly are facing this issue, he explained last week at the Financial Planning Association meetings in Boston. A 2009 Fidelity survey backs him up:  <u>  <a href=\"http://static.reuters.com/resources/media/editorial/20110715/Fidelity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   84 percent  </a> </u>  of advisers said they had clients touched by Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p><p> Mauterstock, the author of &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Passing-Torch-Critical-Conversations-Children/dp/1505395208/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444151022&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Passing+the+Torch%2C+Critical+Conversations+With+Your+Adult+Children\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Passing the Torch, Critical Conversations With Your Adult Children  </u> </a> ,&rdquo; shared seven tips to help advisers, clients, and their families. While many of his suggestions apply to wealthier people receiving comprehensive financial services, they&rsquo;re also useful to people dealing with a parent experiencing cognitive decline.</p><h3> Recognize the  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/5-signs-of-financial-impairment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   symptoms  </a> </u> . </h3><p> &ldquo;Diminished mental capacity is a slow, gradual thing,&rdquo; he explained. Don&rsquo;t wait until the signs become crystal clear before taking action. He used the example of his own client &ndash; a Harvard-educated anesthesiologist &ndash; who started calling repeatedly and asking to speak with his accountant. Mauterstock&rsquo;s staff gave him the accountant&rsquo;s phone number &ndash; only to get the same call over and over again. Better to recognize the signs early, contact the client&rsquo;s family, and devise a plan.</p><h3> Do the Homework. </h3><p> Advisers should have a complete checklist of things to discuss with clients before they experience cognitive issues, from a durable power of attorney to the handling of trusts held in their name. He also recommended documenting client meetings once cognitive decline sets in. Having another adviser in these meetings is in the client&rsquo;s interest &ndash; as well as the adviser&rsquo;s &ndash; and helps ensure that good decisions are being made. An advocate for the client should also sit in, to help with decisions as they become increasingly difficult to work through.</p><h3> Hold Family Meetings. </h3><p> The most important thing an adviser can do when cognitive decline starts setting in is to ask the client to call a family meeting.</p><p> In the meetings, an adviser can earn the family&rsquo;s trust over time,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.giftofcommunication.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mauterstock  </a> </u>  said. They also provide an opportunity for family members to become familiar with the client&rsquo;s long-term care plans and to agree on things like who the future caregiver &ndash; often a daughter &ndash; will be. Once established, family meetings can evolve to encompass other difficult issues, such as the client&rsquo;s end-of-life wishes.</p><h3> Get Organized. </h3><p> Mauterstock believes all elderly people should be asked to &ldquo;keep all of your information in one place &ndash; anything an aging client&rsquo;s family or caregiver might need.&rdquo; This includes: names and phone numbers of doctors, lawyers, and advisers; names of companies with financial accounts, account numbers, user names and passwords; instructions for paying the mortgage, rent, or insurance and when it&rsquo;s due; Social Security numbers; wills and other legal documents.</p><h3> Discuss Long-term Care. </h3><p> Assets can vanish quickly if a client must move into a long-term care facility. Mauterstock said it&rsquo;s critical to clarify for clients that Medicare does not cover long-term care (except for rehabilitation after a three-night hospital stay) and to explain the circumstances in which Medicaid, a federal program for the indigent, begins paying for care. While some people may think they want to live alone after a spouse dies, he said, a visit to an assisted-living facility can change someone&rsquo;s mind &ndash; this helps them envision &ldquo;a new life&rdquo; full of activities and socializing. He also suggested presenting clients with information about long-term care insurance &ndash; &ldquo;whether or not you believe in it, so they can choose for themselves.&rdquo; [Keep in mind the  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/few-need-long-term-care-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research  </a> </u> , which shows that the typical stay in a long-term care facility lasts months &ndash; not year.]</p><h3> Connect to Experts. </h3><p> Financial planners can&rsquo;t be expert in every field. He suggests building a network of professionals to call on for tricky issues, including elder law attorneys, geriatric care professionals, or insurance agents who understand products that might protect their aging clients.</p><h3> Investment Policy Statement. </h3><p> As a client&rsquo;s mental capacity diminishes, he believes that it&rsquo;s helpful to have an investment policy statement, signed by the client &ndash; &ldquo;in case they forget what they&rsquo;ve agreed to.&rdquo; This document can be shown to the client or to family members who raise questions.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 16:21:34.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 16:21:34.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_UFGGw9K.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-tips-for-clients-with-signs-of-diminished-capacity/\", \"post_id\": \"6576\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 16:21:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 16:21:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-tips-for-clients-with-signs-of-diminished-capacity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6575\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3026\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/julAU6xhS6uun4w5heGX_13000310285_d32742e90c_o.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"733\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444222800,"author_id":280,"chart_url":""}

Doesn&rsquo;t happiness come from laughing with friends, having a family you love and enjoying your work?  Certainly there are many ways that you can find happiness outside yourself. But lasting, enduring happiness comes from within and isn&rsquo;t so affected by whether you lose your job or a friend moves half way around the world. You can develop happiness from within in many ways. Here are a few ideas that make sense to me.</p><p> <strong>  1. Live in the moment.  </strong> When you throw yourself into mindfully living each moment fully, you are living as your authentic self without censure or judgment. Living as your true self is an internal source of happiness.  In this Tedx video Kaitlin Armstrong talks about finding her inner happiness.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Cv_o0-m2lsM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-06-at-9.37.39-AM.png\" width=\"851\"/> </a></p><p> click to view</p><p> <strong>  2. Give up routinely pleasing others as the basis for your mood.  </strong> As you go through your day, some people are going to be irritated, disappointed, or judgmental of you. Their reactions belong to them and likely have very little to do with you. Let them have their mood, their emotions, and don&rsquo;t let their emotions change yours. You are not living your life to please others or if you are that will bring suffering. Be aware that they are having an emotion, label it as their emotion, and remind yourself that you are not responsible for the emotions of others and that taking on that responsibility does not make sense.</p><p> If you believe that you have some responsibility, in that you have done something unkind or hurtful, then make amends the best that you can and go forward.</p><p> <strong>  3. Know and live your value and purpose in life. </strong>  What do you value?  Contributing in some way? Building a sense of community? Living your values is a process, an experience. The happiness that comes from that doesn&rsquo;t rely on outcome but knowing that you were true to yourself and lived for what mattered to you.  The person who goes to prison for the rights of others knows that he is living his values.</p><p> <strong>  4. Give up perfectionism. </strong>  Perfection is an illusion; one that means you&rsquo;ll never see yourself as good enough.  If you are a perfectionist, you may not acknowledge that you are trying to reach perfection. You may tell yourself you are far from perfection and that you are trying to be adequate. Embrace your flaws, celebrate your mistakes&ndash;these make you wonderfully human. If you look at nature, there is no perfection. Apples are not symmetrical, rocks have dents and chips, and trees have scars. Yet nature is beautiful and natural. Your flaws are part of you and having flaws and imperfections is reality.</p><p> <strong>  5. Create joy. </strong>  Look for joy everyday, seek it out, create it, and savor it. Find ways to smile as a daily habit.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 16:37:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 16:37:14.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_kLOx3gB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-ways-to-build-happiness-from-within/\", \"post_id\": \"6579\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 16:37:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 16:37:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-ways-to-build-happiness-from-within\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6577\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3027\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444068901577-032823f657b1-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"691\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444245300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2941,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Adapt Or Die Trying: The What, Why And How Of Innovation","link":"adapt-or-die-trying-the-what-why-and-how-of-innovation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In this blog I asked Jake Chambers ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrjake74\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @MrJake74  </u> </a> on Twitter) to share his perspective on innovation, and in particular, to discuss why he believes organisations sometimes struggle to maintain innovative behaviours at scale. This is a subject Jake has much experience with, having developed and implemented an approach that revitalises large organisations by infusing them with the agility and creative dynamics typically seen in tech start-ups. Jake currently works with me in the Financial Services sector, and prior to this he has held strategic advisory positions in both telecommunications and management consulting.   </p><p> <strong>  In his own words, unedited by me, let's take a look at The what, why, and how of innovation.. </strong> .</p><p> There is a lot of noise and activity around innovation at the moment. Small and large companies alike are clamouring to prove their innovation credentials. In my industry, financial services, incumbent banks and building societies are at pains to promote their innovative new services, channels or partnerships with innovative financial technology start-ups (so-called FinTech). Innovation consultancies are selling their expertise, design-thinking frameworks and idea crowdsourcing software. But why is this happening now? Is it all hype? Is innovation really such a strategic priority?</p><h3> What is innovation anyway?</h3><p> <br/> Many commentators have debated the best definition of innovation.  Wikipedia defines it simply as &ldquo;something original and more effective that &ldquo;breaks into&rdquo; the market or society&rdquo;. Although some other definitions might sound more scientific or lyrically pleasing this is perfectly adequate for my purposes and has the key, common elements which are:</p><li> it&rsquo;s new or original; </li><li> it&rsquo;s in some way an improvement over the status quo; and</li><li> it gets applied to change something. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Is innovation just for the usual Silicon Valley tech suspects? </strong></p><p> Many celebrated academics and experts have theorised over the importance of innovation to drive economic and social progress, from Joseph Schumpeter&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo;, through Clayton Christensen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Disruptive Innovation&rdquo; to Peter Drucker&rsquo;s view that innovation &ldquo;is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth&rdquo;.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not going to argue with these eminent thinkers (I mostly agree with them) but I think about the importance of innovation in a simpler way, using an analogy. Charles Darwin said back in 1809: </p><p> &ldquo;It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor is it the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change&rdquo;</p><p> Of course he was referring to species and their evolution in response to the changing environment. Living things may remain unchanged for thousands of years but they all face a material change in their ecosystem eventually. When this happens, they have to adapt or they might end up being competed or hunted into extinction. This stark analysis can equally be applied to the world of organisations.  When an organisation&rsquo;s environment (customers, competitors, regulation or technology) changes it has to evolve or risk becoming &lsquo;extinct&rsquo; or obsolete. When that change involves something genuinely new, we call it innovation.</p><h3> But why now?</h3><p> <br/> There is already much said about the pace of change we&rsquo;re experiencing in today&rsquo;s world. Technology and social trends have colluded to create an environment where greater access to skills, resources and money means new businesses can emerge to challenge established industries faster than seems possible. Nokia grew from relative obscurity to dominate the nascent global mobile phone market only to be displaced itself by the even more rapid growth of Apple (and others who largely copied Apple&rsquo;s basic formula) with an approach more suited to the emerging world of the mobile Internet.  Tesla Motors is another stark example. Barely a decade old, Tesla seemed to appear from nowhere (actually it appeared from a garage in San Francisco) and it&rsquo;s forcing the established industry to adapt and innovate. So for me at least, there is little question over the need to innovate, now more than ever.</p><h3> Why is this such an issue for large enterprises?</h3><p> <br/> Some large enterprises are great at innovating but for most innovation is hard and disruptive. I put the blame for this firmly at the door of two fundamental characteristics of large businesses. First, large businesses are organised to repeat the same processes that create and support the products and services designed for today&rsquo;s market place. They are designed and streamlined to repeat a known recipe over and over again as efficiently as possible. Unfortunately when it comes to innovation, they need to experiment with and develop new recipes. When you have been trained to keep your head down focused intently on measuring out the precise amount of castor sugar and passing the mixture to the next person as quickly as possible, you are not thinking about whether it might be good to try caramel. (Am I taking this analogy too far?). </p><p> Second, large enterprises are, well, large. They are a victim of their own success and perpetual march towards efficiency. In a large organisation, communicating a change in direction is hard and takes time. Especially when those receiving the message need a lot of persuading to abandon a process or task they have been doing, and rewarded for, over a long time. As the overarching goal gets broken down into lower level tasks and targets to make them more directly applicable to smaller teams or individuals, they start to become the mission themselves. People get isolated from the real goal. So when we try to change these tasks to a better reach the goal, we face resistance.</p><p> If large organisations want to innovate they need to re-learn the agility and flexibility that they had as small start-ups but have long since abandoned (for good reason).

I often point out that government policy is a precursor to change, that such policy changes, such as the one  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/india-issues-its-first-sovereign-gold-coin-to-curb-gold-imports/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   India recently instituted regarding gold-investing  </u>  , </a>  have powerful&mdash;and sometimes negative&mdash;consequences, many of them global. Here in the U.S., consider the recent implementation and impact of Dodd-Frank, or Obamacare, or  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/fatca-good-intentions-bad-execution/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  FATCA </a>  (the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act).</p><p> A recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sovereignman.com/tax/donald-trumps-tax-plan-is-supported-by-7-decades-of-hard-data-17483/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sovereign Man  </a> </u>  post makes this point very emphatically:</p><p> \"U.S. regulations have made its entire population guilty of crimes they&rsquo;ve never heard of, often for the most innocent and innocuous activities. <br/> <br/> Operating lemonade stands without a permit, collecting rainwater, failing to file a government survey are just a few activities now treated as criminal conspiracies. <br/> <br/> And yet the government continues to publish upwards of a 1,000 pages PER DAY of new rules, regulations, and other proposals.\"</p><p> Presidential candidate Donald Trump, an advocate for fewer regulations, agrees. In a  <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/7/no-ones-apprentice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   2012 Washington Times op-ed  </u>  , </a>  he wrote that &ldquo;government regulations cost us annually $1.75 trillion. They constitute a stealth tax that is larger than the amount the Internal Revenue Service collects every year from corporations and individuals combined.&rdquo;</p><img alt=\"The Economy Shrinks when Government Grows Too large\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-02/COMM-the-economy-shrinks-when-government-grows-too-large-economic-growth-rate-10022015.png\"/><p> <br/> <strong>  Consider this. In the U.S., we cap debt. We cap pollution. Imagine if we did the same for rules and regulations. </strong></p><p> Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Every sport requires a rulebook and referee of some kind, but the game becomes increasingly difficult to play and compete in when the rules keep changing and getting more restrictive. At some point, government spending related to such rules and regulations becomes too cumbersome. The cost exceeds the benefit, in other words, as you can see in the chart known as the &ldquo;Rahn curve,&rdquo; named for American economist Richard W. Rahn. </p><p> I also frequently comment that governments and economic partnerships, such as the European Union, must maintain a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/as-the-eurozone-stalls-china-cuts-the-red-tape/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   healthy balance between monetary and fiscal policy  </a> </u>  to remain competitive on the world stage. When economies rely only on monetary policy but fail to address fiscal issues such as punitive taxation and over-bloated entitlement spending, imbalances occur. These imbalances inevitably slow the engines of business and innovation, like cholesterol in one&rsquo;s arteries.</p><p> Speaking of which: Every year, the GCI lists what policymakers and business leaders identify as the most &ldquo;problematic factors&rdquo; for doing business in individual countries. It should come as no surprise that the top five factors on average include, in ranking order: As for gold, many CNBC reporters like to comment on the metal&rsquo;s recent underperformance, when in fact gold was down substantially less than the S&amp;P 500 Index this past quarter. Government policy is imbalanced with restrictive, choking global regulations for trade and focused instead on tax collection. We need to reform taxes and streamline regulations to stimulate economic activity.</p><li> government bureaucracy</li><li> tax rates</li><li> restrictive labor regulations</li><li> access to finance</li><li> complexity of tax regulations <br/>  </li><p> Regarding access to finance, the GCI notes that it has worsened in recent years. This worsening is certainly the result of the global financial crisis seven years ago, but financial regulation has gone too far, paralyzing the flow of credit.</p><p> As proof of this, the group writes: &ldquo;Access to finance is now almost as problematic in advanced as in developing economies.&rdquo;</p><p> The WEF&rsquo;s insight, research and guidance are as needed now as they&rsquo;ve ever been. We continue to see deterioration in the global purchasing managers&rsquo; index, mostly as a result of the &ldquo;problematic factors&rdquo; listed above.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-02/COMM-global-purchasing-managers-index-continues-to-deteriorate-10022015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global Purchasing Managers' Index Continues to Deteriorate\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-02/COMM-global-purchasing-managers-index-continues-to-deteriorate-10022015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> As large and important as China&rsquo;s economy is, we can&rsquo;t place the blame solely at the feet of its slowing economy for the world&rsquo;s problems. If we truly wish to see an upturn in business and manufacturing activity, individual governments need to address the ever-amassing regulations, tax complexity and bureaucracy that act like sandpaper to the progress of business, innovations and prosperity.</p><h3> Biggest Gainers and Losers</h3><p> <br/> Before I share with you the top 10 most competitive nations&mdash;which haven&rsquo;t really changed from the previous year&mdash;I want to highlight a few countries that made either some significant gains or losses.</p><p> As I shared with you in March, India was the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/india-the-best-performing-emerging-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best-performing emerging market  </a> </u>  in 2014, rising more than 29 percent. Many analysts, furthermore, estimate that the country will emerge sometime this century as the world&rsquo;s third-largest economy, following China and the U.S. The country that leaped the most was India, rising 16 spots from number 71 last year to 55. I don&rsquo;t think many people will find this surprising. Prime Minister  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/narendra-modi-pro-business-policies-strong-sectors-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Narendra Modi&rsquo;s election  </a> </u>  last year ushered in a new era of business development, foreign investment and anti-corruption. The &ldquo;Make in India&rdquo; initiative, launched by Modi in September 2014, has helped the country surpass China as the world&rsquo;s top destination for foreign direct investment.</p><p> The GCI points out, however, that India continues to face significant challenges. Infrastructure deterioration, a huge lack of access to electricity and slow technological readiness are concerns Modi&rsquo;s administration must take urgent action on.</p><p> Other notable climbers were the Czech Republic (gaining six points), Kazakhstan (eight points), Russia (eight points) and Vietnam (12 points). I shared with you last month that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/heres-your-guide-to-what-the-influencers-are-saying-about-commodities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the Czech Republic  </a> </u>  has the highest PMI reading among emerging European countries and the fastest-growing economy in all of Europe, so its ascent was very much expected.</p><p> You might be taken aback, however, to see Russia rise so much, especially after the plunge in oil prices&mdash;so important to the country&rsquo;s budget&mdash;the weakening of its currency and the imposition of additional sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine. The WEF no doubt anticipated readers&rsquo; disbelief as well, because it writes: &ldquo;[T]his is explained mostly by a major revision of purchasing power parity estimates by the IMF (International Monetary Fund), which led to a 40 percent increase in Russia&rsquo;s GDP when valued at PPP.&rdquo;</p><p> As with India, no one should be shocked by this. The Marxist policies of President Dilma Rousseff, in office since 2011, have only managed to suffocate business development. Brazil ranks as one of the very worst countries in terms of burdensome government regulations, unethical business practices, effect of taxation on incentives to invest and hiring and firing procedures.   The country that plummeted the most was one of India and Russia&rsquo;s fellow BRIC countries, Brazil. Falling 18 spots, the South American nation now sits at number 75 out of 140, compared to last year&rsquo;s 57.</p><p> Besides a loss of trust in public and private institutions because of rampant corruption, the GCI cites Brazil&rsquo;s &ldquo;large fiscal deficit,&rdquo; &ldquo;rising inflationary pressure&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak macroeconomic performance.&rdquo;</p><p> Another BRIC country, China, holds steady at 28. You might recall that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinae28099s-economy-is-undergoing-a-huge-transformation-that-no-onee28099s-talking-about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   back in August,  </a> </u>  I reacted to the news of China&rsquo;s stock market correction and economic slowdown, writing that &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy has begun to shift away from manufacturing and more toward consumption and the service industries.&rdquo;</p><p> My views here are quite validated by the GCI&rsquo;s assessment of the Asian country&rsquo;s current economic condition, stating that China must &ldquo;evolve to a model&rdquo; that emphasizes &ldquo;demand through domestic consumption.&rdquo;  </p><h3> Cr&egrave;me de la Cr&egrave;me</h3><p> <br/> In the map below, you can see the current top 10 most competitive countries, according to The Global Competitiveness Report.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-02/COMM-top-ten-most-competitive-countries-world-economic-forum-10022015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Top 10 Most Competitive Countries, According to the World Economic Forum\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-02/COMM-top-ten-most-competitive-countries-world-economic-forum-10022015.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> As I mentioned earlier, not much has changed since last year. No new countries have entered or exited this exalted list, and there was very little rank-shuffling. For the seventh consecutive year, Switzerland is the most competitive country. For the fifth straight year, Singapore is number two. The U.S. comes in at number three for the second year. And so on.</p><p> For this reason, I won&rsquo;t spend much time rehashing  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/new-economic-report-card-shows-that-the-us-still-has-the-competitive-edge/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what I already said  </a> </u>  in my coverage of last year&rsquo;s report. It&rsquo;s likely you can already identify many of the probable reasons why these nations appear so highly on the index: access to good infrastructure and electricity, quality education and research institutions, availability of the latest technology, strong intellectual property rights and protectionism and much more.</p><p> Each one of these 10 countries has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, for sure, but the common theme among them can be traced back to the WEF&rsquo;s definition of competitiveness. The most successful countries foster &ldquo;institutions, policies and factors that determine the level of productivity of an economy, which in turn sets the level of prosperity that the country can earn.&rdquo;</p><p> Recall  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/a-tale-of-two-economies-singapore-and-cuba/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my comparison of Singapore and Cuba  </a> </u>  in a March Frank Talk. Both small island-states were established in their present forms in 1959&mdash;but with two starkly different economic visions. Whereas one government chose to stress sound fiscal policies and an open business environment, the other all but abolished private enterprise.</p><p> As a result, Singapore is today the second-most competitive nation on earth, according to the World Economic Forum. Meanwhile, Cuba doesn&rsquo;t even rank among the 140 countries the group studied.</p><p> To get global growth back on track, it&rsquo;s imperative that countries follow the leads of Switzerland, Singapore, the U.S. and others that made it to the top of the WEF&rsquo;s list.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 16:56:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 16:56:55.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_YrLGY6H.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-10-most-competitive-countries-in-the-world/\", \"post_id\": \"6583\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 16:56:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 16:56:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-10-most-competitive-countries-in-the-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6582\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3029\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-06-at-10.03.51-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"915\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444237200,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

That&rsquo;s one of the points  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.parsely.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Parse.ly  </a> </u>  made in a recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.parsely.com/post/2565/ona15data-a-year-in-data-from-parse-ly/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   report on how, when, and where people read news  </a> </u> , using aggregate data from its 400 media site clients.</p><p> Some of the findings are nothing new. Expect increasing readership and emphasis on mobile, for example. That attention spans are shrinking is also well-documented. What&rsquo;s the lifespan of an article online? It depends, according to the report. For breaking news, probably a day or two. Lifestyle articles can have a much longer lifespan. Which all makes sense.</p><h3> But there are two big takeaways worth noting here: the loyalty of your readers and the role of Facebook.</h3><p> <br/> With both article life spans and attention spans pretty short, you need to work even harder to earn loyal readers. <strong>  Only 11 percent of an average site&rsquo;s visitors will return in a given month. </strong> Right now readers are hopping from story to story, from site to site. Is this because more and more are getting their news from social? Fewer and fewer are returning to a site unless it pops up again in their social feed with a story that interests them.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no longer about publication loyalty, but story topic loyalty and who covers your topic best. Maybe even being loyal to a specific writer or reporter you follow on Facebook or Twitter. But all isn&rsquo;t lost if a story doesn&rsquo;t get the reach you wanted the first time around. Varying headlines, republishing, and changing keywords are all suggested to get the audience you thought you deserved the first time around. Keep an eye on unique visitors versus returning visitors to track your own site&rsquo;s loyalty.</p><p> <strong>  The biggest takeaway? Social continues to pull away from search, and Facebook is now the gateway to the reader. </strong> We are no longer searching for stories, they are searching for us. And they are finding us most often scrolling through our Facebook feed. Facebook can even extend the life of your content &ndash; if it&rsquo;s your top referral source, the lifespan grows by almost a day.</p><p> All of which makes  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.newswhip.com/index.php/2015/09/the-biggest-facebook-publishers-of-august-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Newswhip&rsquo;s monthly list of the top publishers on Facebook  </a> </u>  more important every day.

As the chart below indicates, investment advisers most commonly charge between 75 to 100 basis points (bps):</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA firms charge 1.03% on average\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmAverageAdvisoryFee.png?t=1444078293046&amp;width=546\"/></p><p> Despite frequent industry chatter around fee compression, average  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-fees\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advisory fees  </a> </u>  still appear to be holding steady around the 1% mark which has been a traditional financial advisor fee barometer. However, as technology advancements continue to drive down the costs of providing investment advisory services and investment advisory firms move more towards a passive portfolio management style, it is possible that advisory fees will decline over time. What's hard to predict is when and how rapidly such compression may take place. As such, fees will continue to be an area of increased scrutiny in future studies.</p><h3> No Correlation to AUM Growth</h3><p> <br/> Interestingly enough, our study found no correlation between advisory fee rates and assets under management (AUM) growth. Thus, advisory firms charging fees above industry norms continue to succeed along with firms shifting to lower cost fee models. However, in an era with increasing fee transparency and increased competition, we anticipate that firms charging significantly higher fees relative to pees may ultimately be forced to fall more in line with industry norms. </p><h3> RIA Firms that Aggressively Adopt Technology Charge Lower Fees</h3><p> <br/> In an earlier post,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-firms-that-adopted-technology-grew-aum-faster-in-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we discussed how RIA firms that adopted technology grew AUM faster than their peers in 2014  </a> </u> . In regards to advisory fees, our study revealed that advisory firms that adopt technology charge a lower advisory fee on average.  Specifically, firms that have not adopted any technology (defined as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/a-guide-to-ria-crm-software-for-investment-adviser-firms-of-all-sizes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer relationship management  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/a-guide-to-portfolio-management-and-reporting-software-for-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   portfolio management and reporting  </a> </u> , and/or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/a-guide-to-financial-planning-software-for-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial planning software  </a> </u> ) charge an average advisory fee 1.11%. On the other hand, advisory firms that have adopted 3+ technology solutions charge a 1.00% average fee which is 11 bps less than firms not utilizing technology. The chart below further illustrates the relationship between RIA technology adoption and advisory fee rates:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA Firms Adopting Technology Charge Lower Fees\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmTechAdoptionVsAdvisoryFee.png?t=1444078293046&amp;width=550\"/></p><p> In the above chart, the maroon color represents the average advisory fee distribution for firms that have not adopted any technology solutions. This group could be defined today as  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle\" target=\"_blank\">  tech laggards </a> . Presently, this group of tech laggards seems to be successfully passing along higher average advisory fees to clients. However, if future fee compression does occur, this group may find itself in a difficult competitive position. It's possible that these firms' lack of operational efficiency due to not adopting technology may not allow them to generate significant profit margins at lower fee rates. On the other hand, advisory firms that are  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/download-ria-technology-systems-integrations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  adopting technology </a>  are already operating successful RIA firms today at lower fee rates and will likely be better positioned to continue to adapt and succeed in the future.</p><h3> RIA Firms that Offer Financial Planning Fees Charge Lower Fees</h3><p> <br/> Advisory firms that offer financial planning services charge an average annual advisory fee of 1.03% compared to an average fee of 1.08% for advisory firms that do not. The chart below further depicts the relationship between financial planning service offerings and advisory fee rates:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA Firms Offering Financial Planning Charge Lower Fees\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmFinancialPlanningVsAdvisoryFee.png?t=1444078293046&amp;width=535\"/></p><p> At first glance, the above chart may seem a bit surprising since it would seem that firms offering financial planning services in addition to portfolio management services are likely to charge higher fees relative to firms just offering portfolio management. Perhaps some of the firms surveyed may be charging separate hourly or annual financial planning fees in addition to the advisory fee charged for portfolio management. We plan to further probe the frequency of advisory firms charging additional financial planning fees in future studies. </p><p> Yet, it should also be noted that our study showed that firms that offer financial planning services tend to also lean more towards a passive portfolio management style which may further shed light on why RIA firms offering financial planning services charge relatively lower advisory fees. The relationship between portfolio management styles and average advisory fees is further discussed below.</p><h3> RIA Firms that Utilize Passive Portfolio Management Charge Lower Fees</h3><p> <br/> Our study also revealed that investment advisers that adopt an exclusively passive portfolio management style charge an average annual advisory fee of 0.94% compared to the 1.10% average fee charged by firms that employ an exclusively active management style. The chart below further shows the relationship between an adviser's portfolio management philosophy and the average fee rate:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA Firms Managing Passive Portfolios Charge Lower Fees\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmPortfolioManagementStyleVsAdvisoryFee.png?t=1444078293046&amp;width=529\"/></p><p> Compared to bucketing RIA firms based upon technology adoption or the offering of financial planning services, the above portfolio management style comparison chart reveals the largest discrepancy in relative fees. Investment advisory firms offering active portfolio management appear to be charging a 16 basis point (1.10% compared to 0.94%) fee premium compared to their peers utilizing passive management. Perhaps firms using active management are justifying this fee premium due to an impressive  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/performance-advertising-why-an-ria-firm-should-exercise-caution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investment performance  </a> </u>  track record. Another reality may be that firms that offer active management may be spending more on internal portfolio management team staffing and need to charge higher fees in order generate attractive profit margins.</p><p> As we have discussed in earlier posts,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/is-your-ria-firm-prepared-for-a-market-downturn-part-1-of-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   selling investment performance is a risky RIA value proposition  </a> </u>  and a higher internal cost structure due to higher staffing costs compared to peers makes it difficult to still succeed in an environment with falling advisory fees. The eternal debate between active and passive portfolio management is not one we will try and tackle, but investment philosophy aside, it's possible that passive portfolio management may just be a better  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/starting-an-ria-firm-choosing-types-of-services-fees-and-clients\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business model for RIA firms  </a> </u> . In our observations, firms using passive portfolio management often have a more enduring value proposition that survives in good and bad market times and better positions the adviser as a holistic wealth manager rather than a portfolio manager solely judged by its latest performance track record. However, this is not to say that firms have to manage portfolios with a passive investment style in order to offer holistic wealth advice.</p><p> Be sure to check back soon as we release our full investment adviser industry report examining the key drivers of RIA firm growth.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-06 17:37:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-06 17:37:16.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_0D7EGy2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/ria-firms-charge-an-average-annual-client-advisory-fee-of-1-03/\", \"post_id\": \"6587\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-06 17:37:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-06 17:37:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"ria-firms-charge-an-average-annual-client-advisory-fee-of-1-03\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6586\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3031\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-06-at-10.43.14-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"895\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444243500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Read this instead, and then go demand a promotion for launching a killer app while saving your company [at least] 6 figures. </strong></p><p> Before we begin, head to Google and search &ldquo;why do technology RFPs exist&rdquo;.</p><p> Back? So let me ask &mdash; how many results were positive? How many heralded the dawn of the RFP, forever improving the way vendors are solicited, retained and put to task? Yeah &hellip; not that many. Instead, most wielded daggers at how they&rsquo;re insulted to receive them or even refuse them outright. How the entire process is a waste of their talents and everyone&rsquo;s time.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s just not just vendors that detest &lsquo;em, issuing companies do too. One of our clients commented on their love of the RFP process &hellip;</p><p> It is time for the RFP to go the way of the PDA, flip phone &amp; beeper &mdash; once leading edge, which have now been made obsolete by alternatives that provide more value. Today&rsquo;s lean business practices demand a more efficient way to move projects forward with trusted vendors. &mdash; <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MediaLabRat\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rob Moore  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  True story &mdash; Humans dislike RFPs. Can you blame them? </strong></p><p> Still, every day, CEOs approve 4&ndash;5 of their top earners spending weeks distracted from their traditional priorities to, instead, gather &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; for an upcoming project.</p><p> They interview stakeholders inside the company &mdash; more peoples&rsquo; time &amp; company money wasted. They accumulate a laundry list of things wrong with or missing from today&rsquo;s solution. Then they start expanding bullets into paragraphs and pages with what the new and improved website, app, platform, portal, etc will do differently. In their research, they stumble across jargon like CMS, open source, HTML5, responsive and API which find their way into the Technical Requirements section. Finally, they propose how long the work should take, which they need to guess at since they&rsquo;re experts in fields other than digital.</p><h3> It gets worse.</h3><p> <br/> Think private enterprise is bad? Let&rsquo;s peek in at the US Fed. Our government writes RFPs to get a light bulb changed. OK fine, to build a $10M system that will manage the operations of hiring a vendor to change a light bulb.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   FedBizOps  </a>  , </u> in the last 365 days the Fed has issued 53,228 RFPs &mdash; shield the eyes of nearby innocents for the math that follows.</p><li> As of 2013, the average federal employee earns roughly $80,000. We can pretend that number is comprehensive.</li><li> Let&rsquo;s conservatively assume that the average RFP takes 4 weeks to gather, write and have approved; and that it&rsquo;s handled by 2 fully allocated employees.</li><li> Each RFP then costs $12,307 to generate.</li><li> Grand total spent issuing RFPs in the last year by the US Fed:$655,113,846</li><p> Sorta makes you wanna crawl up in your Snuggie and sob for a while.</p><p> Remember, your state governments are following the same protocol. In fact, we recently received an RFP from a local county office. It was 58 pages. How long do you think that beauty took to spin up?</p><p> The RFP was hand-delivered from a trusted partner, so we took the initiative to read it. 10 pages in and none of us (we do this for a living) had a clue what they were hoping to communicate. So we started cataloging our assumptions that would need to be confirmed and questions to be answered. After 3 hours we had 5 pages of items that needed clarification before we could have an intelligent discussion about what we thought they wanted, and how we might begin to respond.</p><p> Bonus fact: In order to submit questions to the county we were required to provide estimated budgets, timelines, documentation on our software practice, resumes of everyone that would work on the project, sign several affidavits, complete 8 pages of forms and a dissertation on quantum gravity. The craziest part? I don&rsquo;t think they were kidding.</p><h3> Vendor reactions to RFPs.</h3><p> <br/> Offense, confusion and expletives aside, let&rsquo;s agree that being invited into your RFP process doesn&rsquo;t solicit the abounding sense of joy and pride you imagined it would.</p><p> In the example of the local county above, gathering resources to review their RFP and send an initial response cost New Haircut approximately $2500. What&rsquo;s worse &mdash; we gleaned next to nothing about their goals which meant little value could be delivered in our response. Therefore, our first impressions are that this company will [continue to] be careless with everyone&rsquo;s time. And since they require a fixed bid, we will need to pad budgets to protect from these unknown unknowns.</p><p> Once in a while, though, an RFP hits our inbox that hints at an opportunity to work on something interesting. If we can only get past the bullshit.</p><p> To wade through it, we ask these 4 questions upfront:</p><li> What was the very first step you took when starting this RFP? &mdash; We&rsquo;ve heard things like, &ldquo;We found this great template to write up all of our requirements.&rdquo; Others mentioned how they selected software (like <a href=\"http://www.requirementone.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this </a> ) to &ldquo;streamline the entire process.&rdquo; Yeesh. Needless to say, we respectfully withdraw from businesses trying to capture their unique challenges in a MS Word template created a decade ago by someone in an entirely different industry.</li><li> How many customers have you spoken to? &mdash; Answers tend to hover between &ldquo;none yet&rdquo; and &ldquo;that comes after this phase.&rdquo; How on Earth do you write 50 pages about a solution for a customer you&rsquo;ve never spoken to?</li><li> Which metrics had the greatest impact on your decision to approve this project? &mdash; Let&rsquo;s be honest here, most projects have gotten to this stage because of unsubstantiated instincts or an executive&rsquo;s ego. Or both.</li><li> What kind of budget have you established to complete this project? &mdash; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to tell us! [grumbling and high-fiving heard in the background]&rdquo; Nay. If you&rsquo;ve done your homework, you know there&rsquo;s a market for what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish and how much you&rsquo;d be willing to invest in such an opportunity. The vendor&rsquo;s job is to find the most viable solution within that budget. Minimally, have a range in mind. <br/>  </li><h3> Make it all better.</h3><p> So then, let&rsquo;s summarize what&rsquo;s broken and then offer up some suggested steps to ensure your team is not only better equipped to identify and hire the right practitioner for your next project, but launch a product that has the best odds of creating market impact.</p><h3> Broken: War and Peace.</h3><p> At the highest level, there are 3 egregious gaps within classic RFPs:</p><li> <strong>  They inhibit creativity &amp; innovation.  </strong> Most RFPs come pre-cooked with the company&rsquo;s recommended solution, wrapped inside a fixed timeline with a dash of imaginary budget. If you knew what you needed and how long it would take to build, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to waste your time issuing an RFP to others you consider more experienced, right?</li><li> <strong>  Customers are not represented.  </strong> RFPs include assumptions based primarily on internal stakeholder views of the market, with little to any consideration for what your customer personas want and will ultimately pay for.</li><li> <strong>  Markets have moved on. </strong>  In the span of weeks and months it takes to write your RFP, your customer behaviors have already shifted or been wooed by the shiny and new, aka the competitor you didn&rsquo;t see coming because you were busy responding to responses. <br/>  </li><h3> If not RFPs, then what?</h3><p> You probably already have your list of target agencies you were planning to invite into your RFP process. Hopefully those vendors have come highly recommended and are pre-vetted in some way. If not, first step is to do some googling on who you&rsquo;re inviting in. Don&rsquo;t just stop by their websites, scout for reviews on sites like  <a href=\"http://clutch.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Clutch </a>  and  <a href=\"http://venturepact.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  VenturePact </a> . Look on portfolio sites like  <a href=\"http://behance.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Behance </a>  and  <a href=\"http://dribbble.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dribbble </a> . Read the testimonials. Proactively reach out to and talk speak with their clients.</p><p> Next step, set up a 30&ndash;60 minute screening with each qualified vendor and ask them to explain their process. In-person is always preferred, but a video chat or phone call will do.</p><p> What you&rsquo;re looking to hear is how their lean approach to launching campaigns and products has enabled them to successfully deliver for companies X, Y and Z, and how you&rsquo;ll have an equally successful engagement.</p><h3> How does Lean replace &amp; upgrade the RFP process?</h3><p> First of all, there are myriad agencies out there, all with their own $10 words. What one calls lean, others call MVP and agile. Some talk about discovery, others call it analysis and research. Google Ventures timeboxed their iterative practice to 1 (or 2) weeks and packaged it as a  <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  design sprint </a> .</p><p> The core concepts of lean and agile have been in practice in other industries for centuries &mdash; long before dudes like Steve Blank &amp; Eric Ries evangelized them within tech. But just in case you&rsquo;re a little crusty, a lean approach to building technology products harnesses the utility of  <a href=\"http://www.newhaircut.com/#!/process/how-it-works\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  learn-build-measure </a> .</p><li> <strong>  Learn </strong>  by talking to your [prospective] customers to measure their pains and figure out what you should &hellip;</li><li> <strong>  Build.  </strong> Quickly (think days) prototyping solutions that you share with those customers to &hellip;</li><li> <strong>  Measure </strong>  their effectiveness, learn more and iterate new builds until you hit product-market fit. <br/>  </li><p> The output of lean product development is a functional solution to meet your customer&rsquo;s needs in weeks, as opposed to months of spatting over unproven whims in a stale document.</p><h3> Side-by-side: RFP vs. Lean.</h3><p> Using the previously mentioned local county project, let&rsquo;s pit the RFP process vs. lean and see how things play out.</p><p> RFP: It&rsquo;s now been 2 months since submitting our initial assumptions and questions. We&rsquo;ve been told they are still working on gathering responses from vendors, after which they&rsquo;ll issue an amended RFP (read: rewritten) so that willing vendors can try again. This repeats until vendors have enough information to submit a quote.</p><li> Time: 4 weeks to issue + 8 weeks (so far) revising = 12 weeks</li><li> Cost: 12 weeks * avg. weekly salary * 2 employees = $36,923</li><li> Results: None. Stuck in RFP hell. <br/>  </li><p> Lean: What we&rsquo;d have proposed during that initial screening call is conducting a 2 week discovery session inside the company&rsquo;s offices, understanding how their current systems were being used / mis-used and working with those who would benefit from a better experience. We&rsquo;d arrive at a joint solution that&rsquo;s not only actionable, but something any additional agency/vendor could quote against. Worst case scenario, the county would have paid 1 agency to construct an informed and feasible plan, which they could then use to shop around for additional quotes.</p><li> Time: 2 weeks</li><li> Cost: $6153 [salaries] + $20,000 [approximated cost of discovery] = $26,153</li><li> Results: Customer + market data gathered. Prototypes built + insights captured. Product roadmap planned, including goals, metrics for success, features, budgets and release schedule. <br/>  </li><h3> Summarizing the benefits:</h3><li> Time: You&rsquo;ve rescued at least 10 weeks back to your calendars.</li><li> Cost: You&rsquo;ve saved the company &gt;$10,000.</li><li> Results: You&rsquo;re ready to start building the right solution, versus spending weeks or months more time answering vendor queries.</li><li> Hidden savings: These benefits consider only the first couple weeks. What if we keep going for the duration of the project, which often lasts months or years? How much time and money will you have saved by launching the product your market actually wanted instead of spending months building the wrong thing only to scrap and start over? Is it remotely possible for your cost savings to be less than 6 figures? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  No brainer? Correct. </strong></p><h3> Selecting a vendor to go lean with.</h3><p> The foundational goal of any technology RFP is to select a vendor that will give your company the best success of accomplishing its goals. So in the absence of the RFP, how do you decide who to work with?</p><p> As we witnessed above selecting 1 (tops 2) vendors to conduct a 2-week </p><p> discovery / research sprint will not only save your company time and money, but yield real results. Your only job today is to pick that top vendor to engage, based on the screenings you conducted. Again, even if you decide you don&rsquo;t want to move forward with this vendor after those 2 weeks, you&rsquo;ll now have your roadmap, you can solicit quotes and pick a legit winner.</p><h3> Wrapping up.</h3><p> RFPs and their cousins, RFQs, RFIs &amp; RFTs had good intentions. But what worked well for soliciting vendors to build another spaceship, has failed miserably for innovating new software products and conceiving creative campaigns.</p><p> Should you write things down so you&rsquo;re prepared to talk? Absolutely. But focus on summarizing market economics, discussions with customers and supporting metrics.

Many organizations, however, are proactively creating flexibility programs to boost their companies&rsquo; family-friendly appeal.</p><p> It&rsquo;s great to see these programs being offered, and it&rsquo;s great to see employees taking advantage of these programs. The problem, though, according to Charlie Wells and Joann S. Lublin, is that not many people are participating in them. In their Wall Street Journal article  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/employees-like-flexible-work-programsbut-few-use-them-1443600593\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Employees Like Flexible Work Programs&mdash;But Few Use Them,&rdquo;  </u> </a>  Wells and Lublin say that a LeanIn.org and McKinsey &amp; Co. Women in the Workplace study revealed that only 12 percent of employees participate &ldquo;in programs such as part-time or reduced scheduling or efforts aimed at smoothing maternity-leave transitions.&rdquo;</p><h3> If work-life balance is so important to employees these days, and organizations are providing opportunities to enhance this balance, then why aren&rsquo;t employees taking advantage of them?</h3><p> <br/> Kimberly Elsbach, a professor at the University of California, Davis, says, &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t use job sharing or other flexible workplace benefits (because) they fear being seen as less committed to their careers.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, people want to spend more time with their families, but they also care about their careers and the companies they work for. It&rsquo;s obvious that work-life balance programs are a Catch-22, especially for women. While women have gained some ground in the workplace, that progress always seems to be threatened; their work-life balance issues are different than those their male colleagues face. Somehow, for women, if they aren&rsquo;t spending enough time with their children, they risk being perceived as bad mothers; but, if they take off from work to tend to a family issue or event, co-workers may grumble that they don&rsquo;t care about their job.</p><p> A perfect example of this is when Yahoo CEO  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monica-gallagher-sakala/marissa-mayer-maternity-leave_b_2244952.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marissa Mayer took only two weeks of maternity leave with her first child  </a> </u> . She&rsquo;s recently announced that she&rsquo;s pregnant with twins, and will also take limited time off with this pregnancy. Mayer faced criticism for barely taking any maternity leave, making her seem more committed to her career than she is to her family.</p><p> This is where inclusive leaders need to step in. The best way to change the stigma around these work-life balance programs is to address the workplace culture issues that may be creating barriers to flexibility despite programs you may have in place. According to Wells and Lublin, &ldquo;businesses need to create a culture where people feel safe using flexibility programs.&rdquo; A culture encouraging people to take advantage of flexible options is key. Try holding quarterly meetings to highlight the importance of work-life balance and remind employees of available options.  </p><p> Importantly, communicate clearly that any resentment or workplace harassment that employees display toward someone taking advantage of flexible options will not be tolerated. Fear of backlash from co-workers is often the reason many employees don&rsquo;t use the work-life balance flexibility options available to them. As an inclusive leader, you can also set an example by using these options yourself. If your employees can their leaders taking advantage of work-life flexibility options, they will be more likely to using them themselves.</p><p> <strong>  Work-life balance is important from both a personal and business standpoint. </strong> Employees who find the balance they need in their lives are more productive and, ultimately, more loyal. Build support for work-life balance into your culture for all employees.

There are more ways to fail as a business than just financial. Financially the company is in pretty good shape but is this because travelers often have little or no choice as to what airline they fly between destinations or because United was sought out specifically as the carrier of choice? The customer satisfaction ratings would seem to indicate it is not the latter.</p><p> When asked what changes he would make now that he has taken the helm, Munoz was vague; he mentioned <strong>  better coffee on board </strong> , decreased bereavement fares and improved on-time rates,  <u>  <a href=\"http://time.com/4057869/airline-ceo-apology/\" target=\"_blank\">   according to Time Magazine  </a> </u> . He also mentioned that he plans to fire consultants, which will be of little interest to travelers.</p><p> While Munoz&rsquo;s opening shot may sniff of positivity, I worry that it will end there. United hasn&rsquo;t lost its way because of its coffee nor even its on-time rates.</p><h3> United has and will continue to flounder from a customer perspective because it has lost its &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> It has confused &ldquo;what&rdquo; it does and &ldquo;how&rdquo; it does it with &ldquo;why&rdquo; it does it. Every airline competes for passengers on the what &ndash; transportation &ndash; and the how &ndash; air travel, yet only a few (Southwest and  <u>  <a href=\"http://brandforging.co/delta-how-the-worlds-most-flown-airline-keeps-climbing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Delta  </a> </u> ) have understood why they do it.</p><p> Take the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hoppercom/is-this-the-most-loved-ai_b_7346834.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   most loved airline  </a> </u>  in the US &ndash; Southwest. Their &ldquo;why&rdquo; or their purpose is clear: Southwest exists to connect people to what&rsquo;s important in their lives, through friendly, reliable and low-cost air travel. Every word in this purpose is important as it is the filter through which every decision is measured and made. It is this &ldquo;why&rdquo; that prompted loyal customers in September 2011 to  <u>  <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=iyw6ul1x_n8C&amp;pg=PT34&amp;lpg=PT34&amp;dq=southwest+notes+checks+september+11&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ULD2iWyEU0&amp;sig=sl40h8E97kD6TTXh5LG6lZBlG88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwB2oVChMIjaDdl4uuyAIVxDaICh2MCwFe#v=onepage&amp;q=southwest%20notes%20checks%20september%2011&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">   write checks and send them to Love Field in Dallas  </a> </u>  with letters begging Southwest not to go out of business because they were too loved and would be missed too much. It is their &ldquo;why&rdquo; that has prevented them for charging for 2 pieces of checked baggage &ndash; at the time of writing, the only airline in the US to offer this. This decision not only avoids them breaking their rule of friendly air travel &ndash; fees mean more carry-on luggage which would make it longer for passengers to board, but they have also calculated the enormous financial value of the decision in terms of the loyalty it garners from it&rsquo;s passengers.</p><h3> Southwest has won our heart and in turn won our wallets.</h3><p> <br/> Walk down the jetway to a Southwest aircraft and you&rsquo;ll see a poster on the wall with a picture of the underbelly of the plane and a caption that reads <strong>  &ldquo;Without the heart, it&rsquo;s just a machine.&rdquo; </strong> Southwest is everything that United is not. In the battle for the skies, United has chosen the path of commodity &ndash; chase the dollar and provide more &ldquo;what&rsquo;s&rdquo; to more &ldquo;who&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p> As passengers, we don&rsquo;t buy that way when we have a choice and if your only differentiator is a route or a price, then your only one competitor away from losing out. All of the major airlines have tried to roll out a low-cost airline to compete with Southwest through the years and yet all have failed. Why? Because they didn&rsquo;t know their &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</p><h3> Their deep pockets didn&rsquo;t make up for their lack of love.</h3><p> <br/> A friend recently stranded in an airport due to the grounding of a United flight, tired of the lack of updates from gate attendants, leaned over the counter towards a United employee and asked why customer service is so bad at United. <strong>  Without even looking up from her computer she replied, &ldquo;Because they treat us like sh*% honey.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Until United understands why they do what they do, they will be relegated to making short-term, reactionary decisions about coffee and union-dealings to get through the day in the hope that one of these things becomes the magic pill to win our hearts.Mr. Munoz, for your airline to win our hearts it has to have a heart.

{"original_id":2948,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Liquid Alternatives: Take the Time to Get to Know Them","link":"liquid-alternatives-take-the-time-to-get-to-know-them","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Patrick St. Denis | Spouting Rock Financial</p><p> <strong>  There is almost total agreement that diversification is a powerful tool and that when properly utilized, can smooth returns and provide risk (drawdown) mitigation. </strong>  Even though the inclusion of alternative investments has been proven time and again to provide diversification benefits by providing differentiated sources of return while also reducing the volatility of an investment portfolio, many investors still do not allocate to alternatives. So why don&rsquo;t more investors further diversify their portfolios outside of stocks and bonds?  We find that in most cases, it is because of a lack of knowledge and understanding surrounding alternative investments.</p><p> The inclusion of alternatives in a portfolio may not have enhanced the absolute return of a traditional 60/40 portfolio during the bull market that followed the 2008 Financial Crisis.  However, an allocation of up to 25% to alternatives would have improved a portfolio&rsquo;s overall risk-return ratio even in this period of predominantly low volatility.&sup1;  Given the more recent increased volatility in the equity markets and the uncertainty surrounding Fed Policy, now is a crucial time for investors to refocus on alternatives and how best to access them.  The great news is that alternatives are far more accessible now than pre-crisis thanks to the growth of Liquid Alternatives, i.e. mutual funds whose portfolio managers (or sub-advisers) employ strategies similar to that of hedge funds. </p><p> PIMCO&rsquo;s recent white paper entitled &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.pimco.com/insights/viewpoints/in-depth/liquid-alternatives-considerations-for-portfolio-implementation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Liquid Alternatives: Considerations for Portfolio Implementation  </u> </a> &rdquo; is quite timely.  It provides investors a background on Liquid Alternatives, focusing on the evolution and return characteristics of the universe.  We thought it would be helpful to expand on their introduction and provide a layer of insight as to how we at Spouting Rock look at the universe, think about investment due diligence and ultimately proceed with fund/manager selection of Liquid Alternatives.  As experienced hedge fund and Liquid Alternatives investors, we hope that by providing additional insight to our due diligence framework it might aid the investor community in understanding the vast differences that exist between funds, leading to more informed allocation decisions.</p><h3> Since the Financial Crisis, more and more investors have been using Liquid Alternatives to gain access to alternative investments. </h3><p> <br/> Investors have been attracted by their regulated status, high level of transparency, low investment minimums, low fees and the daily liquidity they provide. As regulated products, Liquid Alternatives are subject to restrictions on the instruments and leverage that their portfolio managers can employ, which limits the implementation of the full hedge fund strategies in some cases. </p><p> <strong>  Since 2008, the Liquid Alternatives universe has experienced a steady rise in assets under management (AUM) to $300 billion and an expansion in the breadth of funds to beyond 600&sup2;, making due diligence on the universe a challenge for most advisors.  </strong> Investors generally hire and build teams dedicated to due diligence, selection and monitoring of hedge fund investments; however, there are far less resources committed to Liquid Alternatives fund selection and portfolio management.  Resultantly, the funds with the greatest name recognition and largest marketing budgets have gathered the majority of the assets in the space, rather than those with the best track record and/or who we would consider to the most skilled portfolio managers.  We have witnessed and believe that the quality of funds will continue to improve as talented managers seek to adapt their strategy to meet the growing investor demand for Liquid Alternative funds.     </p><p> Morningstar, as the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; resource for mutual fund research, categorizes Liquid Alternatives as either &ldquo;Alternative&rdquo; mutual funds or &ldquo;Non-traditional bond&rdquo; mutual funds.  The majority of Liquid Alternative funds are further broken down into the sub-categories on Morningstar: Equity Long/Short, Equity Market Neutral, Nontraditional bond, Multialternative and Managed Futures.  Investors should be mindful that these five general sub-categories are not always representative of the risk-taking or specific hedge fund-like strategies of the funds they characterize.  Investors should also note that within the five general sub-categories, there are approximately 20 different hedge fund-like strategies that the 600+ funds employ.  Potential investors should be cognizant of the vast differences that exist between funds even in the same sub-category, including strategy, style, philosophy, portfolio construction and risk management. </p><p> To an investor who is unfamiliar with hedge fund-like strategies, knowing and understanding the risks (directional and otherwise) taken by the individual alternatives fund manager is the most important aspect of the research process.  We believe that the manager&rsquo;s returns are driven by their investment skill and their ability to execute a repeatable investment process.  Our review generally begins with a thorough evaluation of the marketing materials and a call or meeting with the portfolio manager and/or sub-advisor to gain a better understanding of the strategy and manager&rsquo;s investment history.  Part of this qualitative review involves challenging their investment process and trying to understand how the fund has and would perform under various scenarios.  We supplement this qualitative review with a thorough quantitative evaluation, back-testing the returns to determine the underlying factors involved in their performance.</p><p> Since many Liquid Alternative funds have not been around for very long and have short track records, funds like to list the years of experience of their managers alongside their offerings but only a deeper dive into a manager&rsquo;s experience will bear useful information for due diligence and analysis.  Taking this point a step further, many Liquid Alternative funds are sub-advised by managers who had previous or current lives at other firms with real track records that can be analyzed.  This track record analysis should be conducted keeping in mind any differences that might exist in regard to investment strategy, risk management resources, fund structure restrictions (hedge fund vs. mutual fund), etc.  For example, a hedge fund manager may have generated past returns using more gross leverage than is allowable in a mutual fund product (130%).  When this strategy is modified so that it meets regulatory requirements, returns may be more muted than the hedge fund version, all things being equal. </p><h3> Asset allocation in the traditional framework is challenging because Liquid Alternatives are a disparate collection of strategies with different return streams that vary over time. </h3><p> <br/> It is much more difficult to bind them together as one asset class as is done in fixed income or equities.  We find that allocating to a diversified portfolio of Liquid Alternative funds could potentially add an additional layer of diversification to a portfolio.  We would argue that a total allocation to alternative investments up to 30% is warranted but let&rsquo;s focus on crossing the threshold first for the majority of investors.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.pimco.com/insights/viewpoints/in-depth/liquid-alternatives-considerations-for-portfolio-implementation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  PIMCO&rsquo;s white paper </a> is timely because prior to August 2015 most investors have not experienced a significant drawdown since the Financial Crisis.  Well, this is what it feels like.  This time around, stocks have not bounced back to new all-time highs with the same swiftness as they had following the Taper Tantrum of 2013 or September-October 2014 selloff.  Drawdowns hamper the statistical dynamic of compounding returns of wealth builders, and in some cases they destroy retirement plans of those just prior to transition.  Thanks to Liquid Alternatives, adding alternatives (diversification) to a traditional equity/bond portfolio mix has never been easier.  However, researching and allocating to alternatives remains a task that should not be taken lightly or dismissed by following the herd. </p>&sup1; Spouting Rock, data for 1/1/1999 to 8/31/2015. \"60/40\" refers to the returns of a portfolio that is 60% S&amp;P 500 TR Index and 40% Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index; \"Alternatives\" refers to the returns of the HFRI Hedge Fund Composite Index, which serves as a proxy.  The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index is a non-investable, global, equal-weighted index of over 2,000 single-manager funds that report to HFR Database. Constituent funds report monthly net of all fees performance in US Dollar and have a minimum of $50 million under management or a twelve (12) month track record of active performance.

As much as we learn qualitatively, though, we believe that there is a vast untapped reservoir of experience among successful, and less-successful, partnerships that could be tapped to reveal greater insights that would help business partners succeed.  We want to find out <u>  <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/bizpartners\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more  </a> </u> .</p><p> While business partnerships are often compared to marriages, one difference is that they fail at a much higher rate than marriages. </p><h3> It is estimated that as many as 70% of business partnerships fail.</h3><p> <br/> Research from Funders and Founders estimates that 62% of startup failure is due to conflicts among founders.  So, the single greatest cause of failure among these businesses isn&rsquo;t their product, service, or market, but the inability of partners to work well together over an extended period.</p><p> The limited knowledge base currently available about business partnerships is focused almost exclusively on the legal aspects of partnerships: documenting formation, planning for contingencies and dissolution.  These issues are important, of course, but they are the minimum needed to embark on a business partnership.  What is left out are the issues that often seem to be at the root of the conflicts we see among partners: expectations, work ethic, how contributions are measured, and decision-making.</p><p> If you are in a business partnership or have been in the past, please <u>  <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/bizpartners\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click here  </a> </u> to take a survey we are conducting as part of our ongoing research into what makes business partnerships thrive.

The marina at Le Marin is one of the largest in the Caribbean, with 750 berths. Start there, and make your way down to the luxurious island of Mustique, for an absolutely unforgettable week.</p><p> Easily extended by heading down to the Tobago Cays, you&rsquo;ll find this cruising itinerary full of historic culture, luscious native seafood cuisine, and beautiful scenery wherever you go. These are casual islands that don&rsquo;t expect tuxedos or elegant gowns, but once on board it&rsquo;s always nice to dress for dinner during the voyage. However, if you&rsquo;re tired of formal charity balls and obligatory dinners, it&rsquo;s a personal choice and not a part of this itinerary unless you so desire.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LE-MARIN-MARINA.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 1: Martinique and its expansive marina at Le Marin start things off </strong> by getting you settled on board, then taking a little tour of the restored rum estate at Habitation Clement, or dining at one of the great local restaurants, like the popular Zanzibar, or Ti Toques, a bit out of the way but worth the effort. If you&rsquo;re here in May, the Tchimbe Raid endurance run will be taking place. In June, La Fete de la Musique reggae, calypso, and Zouk musicians put on a rich show. August hosts the lively the Biguine Jazz Festival, drawing impressive names and guests.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ST.-LUCIA%E2%80%99S-RODNEY-BAY.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 2: Cruise down to St. Lucia&rsquo;s Rodney Bay, </strong> where the 2,795 ft.

The Firefly, a quaint and comfortable hotel perched on a steep cliff, offers gorgeous views from the dining areas, but is most famous for its 14 different martinis. Drink one of each and you&rsquo;ll earn a tee-shirt from the Firefly Martini Club. Basil&rsquo;s Bar is one of the Caribbean&rsquo;s most famous haunts for celebrities and famous faces, where host Basil Charles greets guests with Caribbean friendship from the moment you meet. The Cotton Club delivers a luxurious resort experience, plantation style. If you&rsquo;re here early in the year, check the calendar for the Blues Festival at Basil&rsquo;s.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NINE-MORNING-FESTIVAL.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 5: St. Vincent&rsquo;s quiet beaches and beautiful waters invite a relaxing cruise around the island, </strong> with an occasional dive, snorkel, or sail in the beautiful blues of its waters. If you&rsquo;re in the area over Easter, the Easterval celebrations and the Easter Regatta to Union Island may appeal. If you&rsquo;re visiting in May, regattas in Canouan and Mayreau are good options, but the most impressive events surround the Nine Mornings Festival preceding Christmas. Competitions, concerts featuring local music of steel pan, and dozens of festive plans fill the calendar.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ST.-LUCIA-THIS-TIME-TO-THE-PITONS.jpg\" width=\"750\"/></p><p> <strong>  Day 6: Cruise back up to St. Lucia, </strong> this time to the Pitons, near the town of Soufriere. Two majestic volcanic spires rising more than 2,000 feet out of the water make a dramatic landscape, while hot springs, mineral baths, wild orchids, and beautiful beaches dot the shore. WorldArc, a 15 month, 26,000 nautical mile cruise of the southern oceans, begins here in January and ends in the Great Barrier Reef in August for the first half, then departs Darwin and returns to St. Lucia in April.

{"original_id":2953,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Apple Watch is REALLY Doing for Business Productivity","link":"what-apple-watch-is-really-doing-for-business-productivity","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylecebull\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kyle Cebull  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.entechus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   entech  </u> </a></p><p> When the infamous Apple Watch came out, we wrote up a blog on it, believing that it would do some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entechus.com/blog/how-apple-watch-will-impact-business-productivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   great things for business productivity  </a> </u> . You might be surprised to know that we still believe that the Apple Watch is still a great tool for professionals, it&rsquo;s just a matter of how you use it. Here are a few ways we believe that the Apple Watch is revolutionary for business productivity and why it&rsquo;s a viable business tool for your sales staff and other employees:</p><h3> Limits screentime.</h3><p> One of the biggest issues with our smart phones is how often we&rsquo;re engaged with them. According to Locket, a New York based app company, the average user unlocks their phone 110 times a day with one user unlocking their phone up to 900 times. If there&rsquo;s any question that we&rsquo;re addicted to our handheld technology, that should give you the answer. But Apple Watch users report significantly reduced screen time. Think about it &ndash; with all those notifications sitting on your phone, you inevitably pick up your phone and get lost in a sea of Facebook and Instagram posts. But with the Apple watch? You can regain some productivity, knowing that it only takes a flick of the wrist to get all your notifications. Here&rsquo;s a great article from tech blogger Nathan W. Bingham on how the  <u>  <a href=\"http://nwbingham.com/blog/how-a-week-with-apple-watch-reduced-my-screen-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   apple watch reduced his screen time.  </a> </u></p><h3> Schedule and alert management.</h3><p> Keeping a tight schedule in a hyper-connected society can be difficult. When meetings run over or a prospect needs to schedule an event with you &ndash; having wrist-level access to a calendaring app like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entechus.com/blog/microsoft-looking-to-improve-calendar-integration-with-sunrise-acquisition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Microsoft&rsquo;s recently acquired Sunrise app  </a> </u> , is really beneficial. Taptic feedback is silent and with a turn of the wrist you can easily see what&rsquo;s up next without getting lost in a world of social media and e-mail checking.</p><h3> Sales alerts.</h3><p> Perhaps one of the biggest benefits for Apple Watch users is for those who are employed in sales. Paired with apps like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.getsidekick.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hubspot&rsquo;s Sidekick  </a> </u>  and Salesforce, a salesperson can quick be alerted when prospects visit your website, open e-mails or even submit contact requests. This allows for immediate follow-up and action when needed.

Today she&rsquo;s exceeded her goal by $15,318.09 amid the long list of personal and economic hardships. Of course it wasn&rsquo;t a fairy godmother or a genie in a bottle but pretty close. These were complete strangers. 438 of them to be exact. They&rsquo;ve come from all parts of the globe during a year-long campaign to help pay for Sereana&rsquo;s Education on a personal fundraising website called GoFundMe. The site gives any individual the ability to raise funds from family, friends, and even complete strangers. All that&rsquo;s needed is a mobile phone, a bank account, and a dream. </p><p> Think crowdfunding your kid&rsquo;s college education is beneath you? Think again. The practice is becoming more acceptable thanks to the combination of modern day technology and a certain type of investment account that is used to save for college called a 529 plan. There are basically two kinds: prepaid tuition plans and savings plans.</p><p> <strong>  529 Plans </strong></p><p> 529 plans, also known as &ldquo;qualified tuition plans&rdquo; have been around since 1996. They are named after section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code which makes them pretty special.  A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan, funded with after-tax dollars, designed to encourage saving for future college expenses. They can be sponsored by a state, Alaska or Maryland for example, or by a state agency such as Pennsylvania Treasury, and even offered by financial institutions such as TD Ameritrade and Fidelity. Moms don&rsquo;t have to pull their hair out trying to select the right plan themselves. Easily check which ones are offered by state and <a href=\"http://www.savingforcollege.com/529_plan_details/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   compare plans online at Savingforcollege.com  </u> </a> . </p><p> Are 529 plans popular? You betcha. According to College Savings Plans Network, a clearinghouse for information about 529 plans, the assets under management in 529 plans nationally will be in excess of $250 billion for 2015. <a href=\"http://www.collegesavings.org/529-plan-data\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Source: http://www.collegesavings.org/529-plan-data  </u> </a> . The total amount of money invested in 529 plans has grown every year since they were first introduced in 1996 due in part to the rising costs of education and other significant advantages:</p><li> You can start with as little as $50 to open an account.</li><li> Earnings grow federal-tax free throughout the life of the account and will not be subject to annual income taxes tax when the money is taken out to pay for college expenses such as tuition, computer technology and related peripheral equipment.  <u>  See IRS for what's covered and what's not </u> . </li><li> Your state may also offer a full or partial tax break on state income taxes, depending on where you live.</li><li> You can make 529 account deposits automatic, and therefore, easy to manage.</li><li> The person that opens the account controls the money, not the student beneficiary.</li><li> A 529 account is flexible and can pass from one family member to another, including children and their descendants, stepchildren, siblings, parents, stepparents, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, in-laws, and first cousins. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Ugift529.com </strong></p><p> Now for the crowdfunding part. Once you have the 529 Plan set up you can invite your family, friends, and even complete strangers (if that is your wish) to contribute to your child&rsquo;s 529 plan using Ugift529.com. Ugift529 is run by Ascensus College Savings, a program administrator and record-keeper for 529 college savings plans across the country. The service is free to use for the account owner and the gift giver. Think of Ugift529 like a baby registry. Personally, I have yet to use the service myself but it does look relatively easy. They have a four-step process for making the actual gift, either by electronic funds transfer or check: </p><li> Visit Ugift529.com.</li><li> Enter the Ugift code: ________.</li><li> Enter your name and the amount of your gift.</li><li> Make your gift via electronic funds transfer or check. <br/>  </li><p> Make your gift via electronic funds transfer or check. Basically, Ugift529 creates a unique code that is assigned to the 529 Plan. This same code can be embedded in printed and online invitations and on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. Example: \"What does a [enter age]-year-old really want? A college education. Visit Ugift529.com and enter [child's name's] code [Ugift code]!</p><p> I can't promise that 438 strangers will make all your education dreams come true but a code, a 529 account, and a dream will definitely help!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-07 18:57:41.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-07 18:57:41.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_14LTRwE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/crowdfunding-your-way-to-college/\", \"post_id\": \"6616\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-07 18:57:41\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-07 18:57:41\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"crowdfunding-your-way-to-college\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6615\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3042\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-07-at-11.58.12-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"826\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444303800,"author_id":485,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2956,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Donald Trump and the Benefit of Financial Foresight","link":"donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Donald Trump&rsquo;s current net worth &ndash; as he would be the first to tell you &ndash; is estimated to be between $2 and $4 billion, most of which he made through inheritance and real estate investments, along with other business dealings.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/09/02/1-easy-way-donald-trump-could-have-been-even-richer-doing-nothing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   An article in National Journal  </a> </u>  recently took a look at what might have happened if he had invested in an S&amp;P 500 index fund back in 1982 when his inherited real estate fortune was estimated to be worth &ldquo;only&rdquo; $200 million.  According to National Journal&rsquo;s calculations, if he&rsquo;d invested carefully in index funds, Trump&rsquo;s net worth would be a whopping $8 billion today.</p><p> Does this mean Donald Trump is a bad investor? Not necessarily: the oldest lesson on Wall Street is that everything is easy in hindsight.</p><p> While highly speculative, those numbers do highlight the ongoing debate over which is a better investment &ndash; real estate instruments or stocks. Both stocks have and the real estate market have had great runs in recent history and, depending on when you invested, you could make cases for both investments being the better choice.</p><p> But the stock market and the real estate market both experience volatility, dips, and extended recovery times so, for the average investor, a portfolio composed of mainly real estate or other fixed assets (like art or collectibles, for instance) poses some risks that should be hedged with proper cash flow planning, a diversified portfolio, and proper tax planning.</p><h3> Cash Flow Planning</h3><p> <br/> A good financial plan takes into account how much cash you need access to, or may need access to in the future. Cash flow planning should be a key factor in deciding whether real estate investments are part your individualized financial strategy.</p><p> As National Journal points out, Trump claims he is willing to spend upwards of $1 billion of his own money to fund his presidential campaign, yet his financial disclosure statements show that he may have less than $200 million in cash, stocks, and bonds. The rest of his fortune is tied up in real estate investments, which could be much harder to liquidate and use for his campaign.</p><p> Most of us aren&rsquo;t running for president but, if something like the 2007 housing collapse were to happen again, any investor who is predominantly invested in real estate could have problems liquidating those &ndash; diminished &ndash; assets for retirement, college funding, or other non-presidential goals.</p><p> A solution: diversification.</p><h3> Diversification</h3><p> <br/> Whether you are investing in real estate or the stock market, diversification is always a prudent way to address your own risk tolerance and use proper foresight in creating a winning strategy.</p><p> While with real estate funds, diversification can be achieved via many factors, including residential vs commercial investments, differing location focuses, and differing interest rates and financing mechanisms, it is still fundamentally one sector, subject to sentiment and swings.</p><p> With the stock market, on the other hand, diversification allows you the opportunity to invest not only in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, but in a variety of sectors and industries as well. Over the past 60 years, historically, the stock market has averaged an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp#sthash.TXk7awA7.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8% annual return  </a> </u> , so investors with strategically balanced and diversified portfolios, there is the opportunity for steady, while not spectacular gains, with the potential for less risk than investing only in the real estate market.</p><p> An investor who is properly diversified through multiple asset classes &ndash; including real estate if it makes sense for their own customized strategy &ndash; is potentially better protected against the short term results of one asset class experiencing a crash or a prolonged dip.</p><h3> Taxes</h3><p> <br/> Another thing to consider is that options for investing in real estate in IRAs and other tax-deferred accounts are complicated and not every custodian will allow you to include real estate investments in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/self-directed-real-estate-iras.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tax-deferred account  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Hindsight vs Foresight</h3><p> <br/> While Donald Trump is an outlier because his high net worth shelters him from some of the issues with primarily being invested in real estate, it&rsquo;s intriguing to consider &ldquo;what if.&rdquo;</p><p> In the case of a more typical investor, a little foresight can go a long way in making sure you are on your way to achieving your own financial goals. A sound financial plan should be tailored to individual goals and cash flow needs, with a customized cash flow plan, and diversified across multiple asset classes for the potential for steady and compounded growth over time.</p><p> Whether you are Trump with a large inheritance or a young professional just getting started, a solid plan and strategy puts the benefit of hindsight where it belongs: in a conversation over coffee or cocktails, and not as the basis for a winning investment strategy.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-07 19:07:39.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-07 19:07:39.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_LyWbuhJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight/\", \"post_id\": \"6618\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-07 19:07:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-07 19:07:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"donald-trump-and-the-benefit-of-financial-foresight\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6617\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3043\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-07-at-12.08.13-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"684\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444316400,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

Buy-in means they like your idea; commitment means they'll put their money where their mouths are.  <br/> <br/> If company leadership isn't on board with focusing on the customer experience, then forget it; it won't happen.  <br/> <br/> I'll go one step further and call out your CEO.

My Execs Don't Get It!  </a> </u>   <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/06/aligning-organization-around-customer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Aligning the Organization Around the Customer with Customer Rooms  </a> </u>   <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Someone down the ladder gets it  </strong> <br/> Sometimes well-intentioned middle managers who want to do the right thing by and for the customerbegin some localized or departmentalized efforts to improve the experience. Unfortunately, these efforts are typically silo'd and translate into silo'd experiences for the customer. And that's not the transformation you, nor your customer, are expecting.  <br/> <br/> Revert back to scenario #1. In walks the CX professional to recommend a different approach that turns these efforts into a solid business case that then garners CEO and organization-wide commitment. <br/> <br/> Speaking of organization-wide commitment, need some ideas for getting employee buy-in, too? Here's a post I wrote on that topic: <br/> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/10/getting-employee-buy-in-for-your-cx.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Getting Employee Buy-In for Your #CX Transformation  </a> </u> <br/> <br/> (By the way, I haven't forgotten about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/09/treat-employees-better-than-customers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   importan  </a>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/09/treat-employees-better-than-customers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ce of the employee experi  </a>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/09/treat-employees-better-than-customers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ence  </a> </u>  in this equation. For the purpose of this post, know that it's baked into everything we're doing.)  <br/> <br/> Let's assume we've earned that oft-elusive commitment. From everyone. What's next?  <br/> <br/> We need a few things... </p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/07/is-your-customer-experience-suffering.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CX Vision  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/10/linking-cx-strategy-to-corporate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Strategy  </a> </u></li><li> <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/10/are-you-flying-by-seat-of-your-cx-pants.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Governance structure  </u> </a> <br/>  </li><p> ... pretty much in that order.  Without a vision, we have no direction. Without a strategy, we have noplan to execute on the vision. And without a governance structure, we might as well be herding cats; we perpetuate silo thinking and fail to achieve cross-functional alignment, involvement, and commitment that is also critical to a successful customer experience transformation. <br/> <br/> Here's the bottom line. Having executive commitment ensures you'll get resources - human, capital, or other - to execute on your customer experience strategy. Employee commitment means employees are on board to delivered the desired experience. Your CX vision will get everyone on the same page, focusing on the right outcomes. For the customer. And for the business. <br/> <br/> Nothing stops an organization faster than people who believe that the way you worked yesterday is the best way to work tomorrow . -Jon Madonna </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-07 19:13:42.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-07 19:13:42.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_TBger8z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/so-youve-got-executive-commitment/\", \"post_id\": \"6620\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-07 19:13:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-07 19:13:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"so-youve-got-executive-commitment\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6619\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3044\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444211685099-4293f722c74e.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"428\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444324500,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

Unable to easily value, trust or assess most of the financial advice available, they conform to beliefs that financial advice is either for the rich, the lazy, or someone approaching retirement.</p><p> There is however an antidote to break this conformity.</p><p> It starts with a conversation.</p><p> Specifically a different conversation.</p><p> The different conversation needs to create a <strong>  &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; </strong> that changes a person&rsquo;s beliefs such that they realise that conforming to today&rsquo;s dogma about advice is actually a limiting belief for them in their circumstances. Their  <strong>  &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; </strong>  is that the way they have been thinking, acting, investing, believing, saving or spending is actually adding to their financial problems rather than addressing them.</p><h3> Part VI of Those Crucial First Five Minutes&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> My last five blog posts have articulated how best to start and position this crucial conversation. Advising being no different to most affairs in our lives, the better you prepare and position your approach, the better your performance.</p><p> Part 6 (and last) of these first five minutes focusses your different conversation &ndash; your &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; conversation &ndash; with the right person in your client&rsquo;s &ldquo;family&rdquo; (assuming you advise mums and dads, or life partners, or business partners) &ndash; the person who hasn&rsquo;t been involved in meaningful advice conversations due to the aforementioned conformity of beliefs about financial advice.</p><p> So, firstly it&rsquo;s crucial for both partners of the family or business you are advising to be present. Secondly before you begin your own unique approach to your discovery conversation with your clients, you say something like:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;We would like to start this part of our meeting with the person who doesn&rsquo;t get as involved with the financials in your relationship (or family, or partnership, or business). So who will be going first?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Why is this important?</p><p> It&rsquo;s simply a good way to take today&rsquo;s conformity and beliefs about financial advice to task.</p><p> Starting with the member of the partnership or family who has not been as involved financially better enables (though not always mind you) a conversation in something that they are expert at &ndash; what they really want to achieve in their financial lives.</p><p> All relationships exist atop of a myriad of differences of opinion, aspirations, beliefs and challenges. It&rsquo;s crucial for advisers to not only understand these differences, but respect them and manage your advice accordingly.</p><p> By starting your &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; conversation with the people who are not as au fait with mechanics (i.e. the technical stuff) in their current financial lives helps to shift away from today&rsquo;s conformity that advice is about all about money, about investing, about loans or cash flows.</p><p> Money, investing, loans, cash flows, tax structures are obviously important but only in the context of what are all those things are for. Helping your clients individually and collectively achieve things they haven&rsquo;t achieved whilst assisting them manage the things that need management is the essence of the antidote that will dispel today&rsquo;s conformity hindering too many Australians from better financial lives.</p><p> These are the best of times to build great advice firms to deliver great professional advice that, like all professions, aims to serve the greater public good and the needs of your clients whilst delivering great returns for you, your team and stakeholders.</p><p> What do you reckon?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-07 19:46:33.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-07 19:46:33.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_zglcrpg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-start-great-advice-conversations/\", \"post_id\": \"6622\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-07 19:46:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-07 19:46:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-start-great-advice-conversations\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6621\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3045\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/light-night-church-religion-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"409\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444321800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

You may be surprised to know that&rsquo;s exactly what stacks the odds of success in your favor.</p><p> According to research psychologist  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=give+and+take+adam+grant&amp;tag=mh0b-20&amp;index=stripbooks&amp;hvadid=2836103783&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvbmt=bb&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_98cyfpr360_b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Adam Grant  </u>  , </a>  increasing resources increases your likelihood of a project&rsquo;s  success&hellip; but only for a while. There&rsquo;s a critical point when too much money, time, or support actually hurts your mission. When we have fewer resources, we have to embrace the restraints and make careful decisions. When we&rsquo;ve got everything we think we need, it&rsquo;s easy to spend time and money on wasted efforts.</p><p> In her new book,  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Disrupt-Yourself-Whitney-Johnson/dp/1629560529\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Disrupt Yourself, Whitney Johnson  </u>    </a> shares an important observation of the 500 fastest growing companies (as ranked by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/181886\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Entrepeneur magazine  </a> </u> .)</p><p> &ldquo;I was intrigued by the various ways these companies had funded their growth, rather than taking on outside cash. Only 28% had access to bank loans/lines of credit, 18% were funded by private investors, and 3.5% received funding from VCs: as many as 72% of these successful businesses were pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. I believe these companies were successful not in spite of, but because of their constraints.&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;ve seen this first hand, when I look back at the most creative times in my career and in how I&rsquo;m approaching my business now, the best solutions came when we felt the most stretched.</p><p> I also watched the evolution at Verizon Wireless in this regard. When the going was easy, and so many customers were getting their first cell phone, it was no big deal to try something, and if it failed, no big deal. When constraints became tighter and competition stiffer, it became critical to make smarter choices at every stage of the game. It was critical to get feedback on what worked (and didn&rsquo;t) more quickly. Whitney explains:</p><p> &ldquo;Including constraints allows you to make a faster, more accurate prediction of the consequences of your actions, letting you determine which course of action will likely give you the best results.&rdquo;</p><h3> Embracing Constraints When You&rsquo;re Not in Charge</h3><p> <br/> So when I interviewed Whitney, I explained that most folks in our LGL tribe are quite influential&ndash;but for the most part, are not running the show. I asked her for her thoughts on embracing constraints, when you&rsquo;re not in charge. She offered this advice.</p><li> Do your best to stakeholder initial buy-in for your idea.</li><li> Identify the minimum viable product&ndash;a prototype to test. This is the best way to prove-in your idea with minimum investment (P.S. any one who&rsquo;s ever worked with me knows that I&rsquo;m a HUGE advocate of pilot programs. Low risk, high value in convincing others to your point of view. It&rsquo;s hard to argue with success.)</li><li> Figure out how to speak the language of the folks you&rsquo;re trying to convince. The finance crowd speaks and entirely different language than sales or IT.</li><li> Then ask this question: If this prototype works, what does that mean for what&rsquo;s next?</li><li> Get the right people involved. Whitney astutely pointed out, &ldquo;The people who have the hardest time with this are middle managers. They have the most to lose from a big mistake.&rdquo; I agree. Having been in several middle manager roles, I also know that when you&rsquo;re in the middle, feeling constraints from all angles, you&rsquo;re also  in the best position to know what will make the biggest impact.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-07 19:50:12.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-07 19:50:12.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_i8233gP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-succeed-with-limited-resources/\", \"post_id\": \"6624\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-07 19:50:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-07 19:50:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-succeed-with-limited-resources\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6625\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3046\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pexels-photo-large_8.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"719\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444312800,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

After all, you&rsquo;re essentially selling an intangible. No one can touch what you&rsquo;re selling. You can&rsquo;t give people the keys to take it for a spin.</p><p> And &ndash; from personal experience &ndash; I know how tough it can be to be on the receiving end as well: as buyers of services, we have precious little to go on to make a buying decision. Yet, there is one factor that is of the utmost importance if you&rsquo;re selling services. It has the power to convince buyers. Reassure them of the value of what you&rsquo;re selling. Close deals in weeks, rather than months.</p><p> <strong>  That factor ? It&rsquo;s you. </strong></p><p> Why ? Simple. Because, if you&rsquo;re selling a service, you&rsquo;re essentially what buyers have to go on in order to make a buying decision. You&rsquo;re the sample. The test drive. The appetizer.</p><p> And if you&rsquo;re wondering how to sell the most important things of all &ndash; yourself &ndash; wonder no more. Check out the following five elements, and become an invicible convincer (well, not quite, but you get my drift).</p><h3> Get To Know Yourself A Little Better.</h3><p> <br/> The first step is to get to know yourself. You see, most of us suffer from an inaccurate self-image &ndash; and, most likely, we&rsquo;re a little too hard on ourselves.</p><p> Lifehacker has a useful process for how to change that &ndash;  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/how-to-change-your-self-perception-to-leverage-your-hid-1660090757\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   how to change your self perception to leverage your hidden strengths  </u>  . </a></p><h3> Be A Not-Know-It-All.</h3><p> <br/> Before you can start convincing others, you&rsquo;ll need them to start trusting you. Yes, I know, you have a triple PhD and are the world&rsquo;s largest expert on Vietnamese baby carrots &ndash; so people are bound to listen when you speak, right ?</p><p> Not so.</p><p> My colleague and friend Charles Green puts it this way &ldquo;Being right is vastly overrated. Earning the right to be right is where the action is and where most consultants fall down. An ounce of listening&mdash;paying attention, paraphrasing, conveying empathy, going where the client goes&mdash;is worth a pound of correct answers, references, and credentials.&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re looking for ways to build trust with clients, colleagues, peers, buyers, advisors and basically anyone else you interact with on a regular basis, check out Charlie&rsquo;s post on  <a href=\"http://trustedadvisor.com/articles/create-trust-gain-a-client\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Create Trust, Gain A Client.  </u>  &rdquo; </a></p><h3> Practice, Practice, Practice.</h3><p> <br/> Think about the late Steve Jobs &ndash; one of the world&rsquo;s greatest speaker, charismatic CEO and technology evangelist. Steve  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10?op=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   obsessed about details  </a> </u> , and spent (not hours, not days, but) weeks practicing and rehearsing every keynote he ever gave. The end result was a polished piece of perfection.</p><p> In order to be convincing in the boardroom, you need to do your practicing outside of the boardroom. Don&rsquo;t practice at the game.</p><h3> Speak In Soundbytes.</h3><p> <br/> People have a limited attention span, and some senior executives have the equivalent of that of a small puppy. If you want to get through to them, you&rsquo;ll need to keep things short, succinct and simple.</p><p> Practice speaking in soundbytes: easily digestible, quick-to-remember phrases that capture the essence of an idea and help your counterparts remember it. And here&rsquo;s a secret tip: people are wired to think in threes, fives and sevens. Ever wonder why there are so many blogposts that start with &ldquo;3 Ways To &hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;The 7 Habits Of &hellip;&rdquo; ? If you want to be seen as an able, strong communicator, don&rsquo;t ramble. Speak in soundbytes and easily digestible &ldquo;rules of three&rdquo;.</p><h3> Use the PSR Approach.</h3><p> <br/> Peter Cohan wrote a great post on Inc.com on a  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/peter-cohan/use-this-winning-technique-to-sell-yourself.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Winning Technique To Sell Yourself&rdquo;  </u> </a> . His premise is simple: use a three-step process (see, there&rsquo;s that rule of threes again) to communicate your value.</p><p> First, start by identifying and defining the Problem. Describe the cause, its impact, the environment and how exactly it was &ldquo;hurting&rdquo;. Then, explain the Solution &ndash; what you did about it, how and why it worked, what you discovered along the way and what the outcome was. Finally, describe the Results you achieved. Talk about the quantitative and qualitative outcomes.

It&rsquo;s an age-old question, and evidence exists to support both sides.</p><p> Many leaders have qualities that seem innate,  <u>  as Forbes notes </u> . Confidence, a positive attitude, intelligence, exceptional communication skills, a sense of humor &mdash; these are typically characteristics inherent to an individual&rsquo;s personality.</p><p> Sure, some leaders are simply smarter or luckier than other people. But it seems that in most cases, leaders have to work at setting an example that others want to follow. They do so by engaging in a number of positive behaviors.</p><h3> They&rsquo;re persistent</h3><p> <br/> Leaders don&rsquo;t quit the first time something doesn&rsquo;t go their way. They keep at it, and most enjoy the journey almost as much as the destination. They know there&rsquo;s a lot of valuable information to be gleaned and skills to be mastered along the way.</p><p> Not everyone is born with an assertive personality. But leaders learn to keep going despite having doors slammed in their faces &mdash; sometimes literally. They  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/zalmiduchman/2015/04/24/how-i-discovered-the-importance-of-persistence-and-learned-to-annoy-the-heck-out-of-everyone/\" target=\"_blank\">   overcome passivity  </a> </u>  and keep pushing until they achieve their goals.</p><p> They work hard and invest in themselves</p><p> The image of the CEO who spends her days out on the golf course is a myth. Most leaders &mdash; and most successful people in general &mdash; work extremely hard, putting in many more hours than average people.</p><p> Time off? You won&rsquo;t find leaders slumped on the couch catching the latest reality show. More than likely, they&rsquo;ll be bettering themselves or helping others, whether it&rsquo;s reading books related to their fields, keeping their bodies healthy or volunteering in the community.</p><p> Individuals in leadership roles never feel that they&rsquo;re done with their own educations. They always want to grow and improve, and they invest significant time in learning new things, refining their skills or finding new ways in which to stretch their abilities. They consider themselves a project that&rsquo;s never finished.</p><h3> They learn from mistakes</h3><p> <br/> When average people make mistakes, they get down on themselves. Often, the negative voices in their heads prevail, and they stop trying altogether. For leaders, mistakes aren&rsquo;t the end of the world. In fact, they&rsquo;re opportunities to learn and improve.</p><p> Without people willing to keep trying despite making mistakes, there would be no progress in the world. And without mistakes, there is no learning. Leaders know there&rsquo;s significant truth in the old adage: Practice makes perfect.</p><h3> They set goals</h3><p> <br/> Leaders don&rsquo;t fly blind. They create plans and set goals.</p><p> Goals create a framework for tangible action to meet larger objectives. Whether it&rsquo;s increasing a company&rsquo;s sales or rolling out a new product, goals serve as a road map toward success. The simple practice of creating goals gets team members on the same page and provides benchmarks for measuring performance. Goal-setting also  <u>  <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-motivation-goal-setting-businesses-2506.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fuels motivation  </a> </u>  as everyone moves in the same direction.</p><h3> They don&rsquo;t give in to failure</h3><p> <br/> Did you know that before he became one of the best-known scientists in history, Albert Einstein was  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.creativitypost.com/psychology/famous_failures\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   somewhat of a failure  </a> </u> ? In college, a professor derided him as lazy, and he was forced to take an entry-level job in government after graduation. Fortunately, young Albert didn&rsquo;t let his early fits and starts deter him, and he went on to great things.</p><p> Great leaders don&rsquo;t give up, and they don&rsquo;t listen when people call them failures. They get right back up and keep going.</p><h3> They build support systems</h3><p> <br/> No one can do everything on their own. Even the best and brightest need help sometimes. Great leaders know this, and they surround themselves with friends and colleagues who can help them improve and continue achieving their goals. They stay away from toxic, negative people, instead spending their time with smart, positive people who are determined to be successful.</p><h3> They have a spirit of service</h3><p> <br/> Leaders help other  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/7-ways-that-great-leader-thinks-differently.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   develop their talents and skills  </a> </u> . They&rsquo;re generous with their time and often can be found mentoring young people. They act as role models, and they&rsquo;re conscious of the ways in which they can serve others.</p><h3> What makes a highly effective leader?</h3><p> <br/> Viewed from afar, leaders can seem almost superhuman. Brilliant ideas seem to flow effortlessly, and everything they touch seems to turn to gold. The truth is that for most, learned and practiced habits make the difference between mediocrity and greatness. Persistence, setting goals, rebounding from failure and serving others build the character that makes a true leader.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-07 19:57:20.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-07 19:57:20.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_lb7Z7Wh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/highly-effective-leaders-practice-these-7-habits/\", \"post_id\": \"6629\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-07 19:57:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-07 19:57:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"highly-effective-leaders-practice-these-7-habits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6630\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3048\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pexels-photo-large_9.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"564\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444320000,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2962,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Principles of Genuine Kindness","link":"5-principles-of-genuine-kindness","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The definition of kindness is, &ldquo;the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.&rdquo; In a perfect world this is a quality we would wish to bestow upon ourselves and hope others also possess. But why does it seem so hard.</p><p> I know what you are probably thinking, &ldquo;Speak for yourself. It&rsquo;s not hard for me. I&rsquo;m a kind person, it&rsquo;s everyone else who isn&rsquo;t kind.&rdquo;</p><p> Well here in lies the greatest obstacle to creating a world where kindness is the unwritten law of the land; the habit of humanity; the definition of our existence. The obstacle to this is the fact that humankind has relinquished control to our primitive nature, controlled and orchestrated by (what I call) our automatic brain.</p><p> Let me digress, briefly, to shed light on this brain. Our automatic brain is the same brain as our cave dwelling ancestors and the major driving force in animals (including us Homo sapiens). It does not think (i.e. lacks consciousness) and only reacts. It reacts to anything it picks up as potentially dangerous, threatening, or causing us to feel vulnerable. When any of these are detected it automatically reacts causing us to fight or flee. How does it know what is dangerous? Through a lifetime of storing information. When I say this brain doesn&rsquo;t think, that is different from the idea generating thoughts. It can cause us to have thoughts if those thoughts help us to fight or flee danger. For example, let&rsquo;s say you grew up in a home where you were taught that rich people were evil. As you grew and became more educated, it led you to a career where you began to enjoy financial success. All of a sudden you begin to develop negative thoughts about yourself and feel anxiety. Why? Because your automatic brain detects this success as something dangerous because of the stored data from childhood and it is doing whatever it takes, by all necessary means, to get you to fight or flee this &ldquo;danger&rdquo;. Such is an example of a modern day saber-toothed tiger.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s get back to kindness. I have highlighted the existence of a primitive nature controlled by a very basic reactive brain, the automatic brain (AB, for short). All humans possess this equally. But there is another part of us humans&mdash;a higher mind: reflective and conscious, pure and powerful&mdash;a gateway to our Divine nature. This is from where genuine kindness arises.</p><p> But our AB is quite creative in how it protects us from so-called danger. Some people over the centuries have viewed the AB as ego or even the Devil. It can use kind acts to manipulate and to gain power over another. As well, being kind toward another may trigger danger as this brain may pick up that you are placing yourself in a vulnerable position and therefore the AB will cause you to fight or flee being kind; thus, the complexity and difficulty of being kind.</p><p> So how do we practice kindness with purity and from our Divine nature rather than orchestrated by our AB, and hence, our primitive nature?</p><h3> 1. Give with no expectations</h3><p> <br/> In other words, give with no strings attached. When we give with expectations of something in return, that is a sign our AB is taking the lead. When we expect something in return, that indicates our AB is trying to use kindness to gain the upper hand, thus insulating us from the danger of others taking advantage, or manipulating, us. Giving for display purposes, i.e. for the purposes of being viewed by others as a good person, may have immediate benefits on those to whom you give, but ultimately since it comes from the AB, will not nurture the Divine and genuine. In my mind, authentic giving without expectation leads to receiving without limitation.</p><h3> 2. Understand that self-sacrifice often leads to self-sabotage</h3><p> <br/> Surely it&rsquo;s good to give of yourself, right? However, some of the greatest givers have allowed their own lives and families to fall apart. That is a sign that poverty and lack has somehow been programmed in their memory backs as something with which they are comfortable and the opposite as something dangerous (as the example above).  In order to be connected with true Divine kindness, you must first keep your own house in order&mdash;adequate (preferably abundant) food, clothing, and shelter. When you sacrifice yourself at the expense of others, you will block the access to true kindness, likely leading to resentment, inner anger, and even jealousy. Another way to look at this is a drowning person cannot help someone else who is drowning.</p><h3> 3. Practice the Golden Rule</h3><p> <br/> The most familiar version of the Golden Rule says, &ldquo;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&rdquo; Certainly, we would want others to be friendly, genuine, and considerate toward us, so it would make sense to do the same to others. Naturally, our AB will warn us that such action can make us more vulnerable. Such warnings are typical characteristics of the AB, which is forever scouring the landscape 24/7 for evidence of things that can hurt us. Don&rsquo;t trust those warnings and practice this rule and realize we are all in this earth-boat together.</p><h3> 4. Radiate Kindness</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever described someone as having a &ldquo;kind face&rdquo; or say someone has &ldquo;kind eyes.&rdquo; I have. When you go through your days, no matter how stressful, maintain an upright posture, a smile on your face, and widen yours eyes (not in a creepy sort of way!). You can check in occasionally by viewing yourself in the mirror of a car, for instance. When you walk down the street envision your eyes sparkling, your face aglow, and your lips smiling. This will attract kindness to you and make your practice easier&mdash;more consistent with the Divine within you.</p><h3> 5. Practice Non-Discriminatory Kindness</h3><p> <br/> I think we can all agree that giving a homeless person a piece of bread or place a shirt on their back is an act of kindness. But what if you saw a millionaire in need of help. Or saw anyone in need of help who you perceived to have more than you or who was more powerful than you? Could you be kind to that person? You see, our AB does have us discriminating as a protective, defensive mechanism. &ldquo;Why should I help that dude? They don&rsquo;t help me?&rdquo; (Hey, remember the first item on this list?!). Or you may be thinking, &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need me to be kind. They can pay people to be kind to them.&rdquo; You will find that when you follow your Divine instinct for kindness, you will not discriminate. I suspect, also, this practice will draw more kindness in your direction in ways you cannot even imagine.   </p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-07 20:02:23.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-07 20:02:23.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_c3Fl2HC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-principles-of-genuine-kindness/\", \"post_id\": \"6632\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-07 20:02:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-07 20:02:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-principles-of-genuine-kindness\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6631\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3049\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/d1524764.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1193\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444331700,"author_id":149,"chart_url":""}

Mobile optimization includes  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/what-is-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   responsive web design  </a> </u>  that allows components of your website to move around depending on the size of the smartphone or tablet screen.</p><p> Start today: Unsure if your company website is mobile friendly? Visit  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google&rsquo;s Mobile Friendly Test  </a> </u> , enter your website address, and see if it passes the test.</p><h3> Poor Navigation</h3><p> <br/> Visitors want to be able to find what they are looking for in as few clicks as possible. If you&rsquo;re receiving a lot of questions during your sales process that are answered on your website, it is a sign your navigation is not showing people relevant information when they need it.</p><p> Remember that good navigation isn&rsquo;t just about having an easy-to-use menu bar that is consistent on all pages. Studying how people use your website will help you create &ldquo;paths&rdquo; that can reveal important sales information on your product or service at just the right time.</p><p> Start today: Head over to UserTesting.com and hire real people to try to accomplish tasks on your website, then watch the videos and see where they stumble.</p><h3> High Bounce Rate</h3><p> <br/> Your website analytics hold valuable performance information. Most bounce rates fall between 26 and 70 percent, with the average bounce rate being 45 percent. High bounce rates could mean that the homepage loads slowly, there are usability issues or the design doesn&rsquo;t live up to the expectations the visitor has before they visit your site. A redesign will optimize pages to improve bounce rates and boost overall levels of customer satisfaction.</p><p> Most folks seem to think more links on a page are better, but simplifying the page and removing choices and distractions can actually help improve the user experience.</p><p> Start today: Look at your homepage bounce rate. If it&rsquo;s higher than 50%, consider optimizing by re-writing some of the copy on the page to be more customer focused or removing some links so that people have a clear path to the information they need.</p><h3> Too Much Company Speak</h3><li> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in business since 1932.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We specialize in complex solutions to your problems.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Our team has over 30 years of experience.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Unparalleled customer service.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Chances are your company website has one or more of these meaningless phrases (or similar phrases). Not only do these distinctions sound exactly like your competitors, but they  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/qualified-leads-honest-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   don&rsquo;t speak to your potential customer&rsquo;s needs  </a> </u> .</p><p> If your homepage focuses more on your company than your customer, then it needs to be changed.</p><h3> Low Conversion Rate</h3><p> <br/> As we&rsquo;ve said before, conversion rate (the percentage of people that become contacts after visiting your website)  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/conversion-rate-not-just-for-ecommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   isn&rsquo;t just for ecommerce companies  </a> </u> . Manufacturing companies, specialty medical practices, and architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) firms (just to name a few) need to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/conversion-optimization-is-worth-your-marketing-budget/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pay attention to their conversion rates  </a> </u> .</p><p> If less than 1 in 100 people that visit the company website become a sales lead, then you need to fix your website.</p><p> Start today: Has your website gotten off track? Check out our article on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/seasonal-7-step-inbound-marketing-website-optimization-checklist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   7 steps to optimize your website  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/request-website-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   request a website review  </a> </u>  conversation with our team of experts.</p><h3> No Opt-In Box</h3><p> <br/> If your website is the calling card, the opt-in box is an invitation to the customer to start a relationship with your brand. Capturing email addresses and building a list is essential for any business. If your website is lacking an opt-in box, be it an online newsletter subscription box or a form to download an e-book or guide, you are losing valuable leads for your company.</p><p> If you have any of these big issues, a redesign should be on the top of your list. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to completely overhaul your entire website &mdash; consider an incremental approach. Putting money in your marketing budget to improve your website constantly will be a cost-effective move for your business.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-08 18:46:24.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-08 18:46:24.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_LxYGw08.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/6-telltale-signs-your-website-needs-a-redesign/\", \"post_id\": \"6636\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-08 18:46:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-08 18:46:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"6-telltale-signs-your-website-needs-a-redesign\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6635\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3051\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444208393177-b2a88904ed8d-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"736\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444393800,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2965,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Raise Mentally Tough Kids","link":"how-to-raise-mentally-tough-kids","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  When I was offered a position as an FBI agent, I was told one of the things they liked most about me was that I came from a large cattle ranch in the middle of Wyoming. I was not one of the pampered and coddled kids so often produced by modern parents and growing up in the suburbs. </strong></p><p> Living on a ranch, I learned the meaning of the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; because my daily chores included feeding horses, cows, cats, dogs and a meager number of chickens that managed to escape the jaws of hungry coyotes.</p><p> The word chore means &ldquo;a necessary but unpleasant task.&rdquo; In fact, I couldn&rsquo;t join after-school programs or participate in sports because my first responsibility was always my chores waiting for me at home. </p><p> In the rough Wyoming winters, the very weather I most wanted to avoid is exactly when I was most needed by the animals who depended upon me for their food, water, and shelter. It mattered when I was late&mdash;or simply forgot because of my own selfish behavior. I saw it in their eyes as they waited with expectation for me to take care of them.</p><p> I was not raised to be a wimp because I&rsquo;d rather be snuggled up next to a fireplace in a snowstorm, nor to be self-indulgent because I&rsquo;d rather be doing something that was fun rather than a chore that was work&mdash;I was raised to be mentally tough by understanding the importance of grit, accountability, and self-reliance. </p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.braunresearch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2014 Braun Research  </a> </u>  study surveyed 1,001 U.S. adults and found 82 percent had regular chores as youth, but only 28 percent expect the same for their children.</p><p> The reason?</p><p> Kids are so busy learning foreign languages, sports, and other skills that will catapult them to success as adults that they have no time for the rigors, discipline, and dull routine of household chores.</p><p> There is no doubt that the discipline of learning in general, and sports in particular, will lead to confidence and self-reliance. But according to Richard Rende, co-author of &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Can-Do-Kids-Children-Fast-Changing-ebook/dp/B00O2BKKYE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443996844&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=raising+can+do+kids\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Raising Can-Do Kids  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; decades of studies show that household chores are a proven predictor of success.</p><p> To raise kids who are mentally tough in today&rsquo;s world means they need to succeed academically, emotionally, and professionally. Academics, sports&mdash;and yes, chores&mdash;all need to be present if you want your child to have the mental toughness they will need to thrive as adults.</p><p> Here are 5 tips on how to raise kids who are mentally tough:</p><h3> 1. Start Early</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://centerforparentingeducation.org/library-of-articles/responsibility-and-chores/part-i-benefits-of-chores/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dr. Marty Rossmann  </u> </a>  found that young adults who began chores at the age of 3 were more likely to have good relationships with family and friends, to achieve academic and early career success, and to be self-sufficient.</p><h3> 2. Create A Need For Empathy</h3><p> <br/> While livestock in the backyard may not be suitable for most suburban families, when your child learns to care about someone or something besides themselves, they become empathic and responsive to the needs of others.</p><p> In a startling survey by  <u>  <a href=\"http://richardweissbourd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   psychologist Richard Weissbourd  </a> </u> , he discovered that almost 80% of high school students chose either achievement or happiness over caring for others.</p><p> Parents can readjust their child&rsquo;s skewed priorities by teaching them to be loving and kind at home. Pets are a great place to start, just as I grew up loving animals.</p><h3> 3. Stick To Your Guns</h3><p> <br/> Many kids do have household chores, but when they come whining and complaining about how much homework they have to do, parents are tempted to let them off the hook.</p><p> Big mistake.</p><p> You are sending a dangerous message to your kid about their responsibilities and priorities by saying that achievement is more important than sticking to their commitments. They may be able to sweet-talk you into giving in, but eventually they will meet someone who is not concerned that they&rsquo;ve got a full plate.</p><p> I mean, how well do you think whining and complaining about a busy day is going to work with their boss?</p><h3> 4. Use The Right Language</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8624\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Studies  </u> </a>  have found that being described as a &ldquo;helper&rdquo; gives a child a positive role and identity, as opposed to saying the child is &ldquo;helping.&rdquo;</p><p> A helper is an individual of action who helps others.</p><h3> 5. Praise Often</h3><p> <br/> Remember to acknowledge when your kid has done their chores and to praise them correctly by saying, &ldquo;You did a great job because you worked so hard.&rdquo;  When you affirm that they have succeeded because of the effort they put out, they will understand that it always takes effort to do a job well. </p><p> This creates a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mindsetonline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   growth mindset  </a> </u> &mdash; I can learn to be smarter, better, or more skilled.</p><p> Never say, &ldquo;You did a great job because you are so smart.&rdquo; This creates a fixed mindset that leads a child to believe their success is dependent upon their intelligence, skills, or attractiveness.</p><h3> 6. Keep Allowances And Chores Separate</h3><p> <br/> Experts advise that external rewards, like money, can actually lesson a child&rsquo;s motivation to help out with chores. Rewards teach them to turn altruistic acts into business transactions.</p><h3> 7. Teach Independence</h3><p> <br/> Why do American children depend on their parents to do things for them that they are capable of doing for themselves? </p><p> According to the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304450004577277482565674646\" target=\"_blank\">   Field Guide to the Middle Class  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; while a 5-year-old in Peru&rsquo;s Amazon region can be found climbing trees to harvest papayas and &ldquo;helping haul logs thicker than her leg to stoke a fire,&rdquo; an 8-year-old in America&rsquo;s Los Angeles region can be found lying on his back on a sofa, ordering his dad to untie his shoe&mdash;and being scolded only because he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;please.&rdquo;</p><p> We&rsquo;re all very busy, and sometimes it&rsquo;s just much easier to do the chore ourselves rather than see it done slowly and imperfectly. But parents are the ones who must teach their kids to be capable and independent.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/chores-for-children?page=3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here for a list  </a> </u>  of suggested chores by age.</p><p> How have you raised your child to be mentally tough?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-08 18:56:47.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-08 18:56:47.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_RHrj1Og.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-raise-mentally-tough-kids/\", \"post_id\": \"6638\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-08 18:56:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-08 18:56:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-raise-mentally-tough-kids\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6637\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3052\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/city-street-house-broken-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"581\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444467600,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

Great. Figure out how. Want to be an author? Great. Figure out how. Your ambition will drive you. If you conk out along the way, you didn&rsquo;t want it badly enough. Then you only need to ask yourself, &ldquo;What was I unwilling to give up to achieve my goal?&rdquo; Once you have the answer you can reassess whether you truly want to achieve the goal. Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll start up again with your newfound wisdom. Otherwise, move on.

Click the Interview Intervention link and enjoy a free eBook download. I give it away.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;re afraid of failure. </strong> This one is different than fearing the unknown. You actually are afraid to fail whether you know how to do something or not. You simply fear falling down. The most successful people I know fail in glorious fashion every day. That&rsquo;s what ultimately makes them succeed because only those who are willing to go too far can know how far they can actually go.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;re unwilling to do whatever it takes. </strong> When I previously addressed the issue regarding goals, I mentioned asking yourself what you were unwilling to do to achieve something. Often, people fail not because they couldn&rsquo;t do something, but because they were unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices and accommodations to free themselves to do it.</p><p> <strong>  You&rsquo;re not likable. </strong> I know many unlikable, brilliant people. They&rsquo;ll never go as far in life as a quasi-talented, hardworking, likable person. It&rsquo;s a universal law. Of course, there are exceptions. In this case, there are very few exceptions.</p><p> <strong>  Your attitude stinks. </strong> This is an albatross around your neck. You&rsquo;re sour. Perhaps you always think it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s fault you&rsquo;re not where you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Over the course of your career and life, you will discover you are ultimately a victim of your own vibration.

{"original_id":2967,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Generation Y: How you Can Help Your Kids and Grandkids Survive Financially","link":"generation-y-how-you-can-help-your-kids-and-grandkids-survive-financially","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If it seems that there is constant negative press about Generation Y and its ability to survive in today&rsquo;s economy, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s a lot tougher out today for young people to make it financially. Tuition fees are extraordinarily high and continue to climb. Home prices in the Lower Mainland are pretty much unaffordable for most people, and retirement will likely be a thing of the past by the time your kids and grandkids reach age 65. No matter how bleak things look, you still need to encourage them to budget and save. If you are able to, help them financially, albeit responsibly.</p><h3> Generation Y: Tips from a Financial Advisor on How to Help</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Give Generation Y money to help them save for their education.</h3><p> <br/> If you are financially able to, direct any child benefits or gifts of money your child receives into a Registered Educational Savings Plan (RESP). Show your kids the power of savings by letting them see their RESP statements and encourage them to put babysitting monies, or other income earned into it. It&rsquo;s important they help to contribute to their education costs.</p><p> Often aunts, uncles, grandparents &amp; family friends give cash as gifts to young kids and continue the giving cash well into their teens. This money often is wasted on fun and frivolous things. Why not ask the parents to set up a Registered Educational Savings Plan (RESP) for the child and request any monies you give be put into this education fund. You can even ask for a receipt of purchase. Whatever monies you give annually will also receive the Canadian Government Grant of 20% on the amount deposited up to a maximum of $500 grant annually. In addition, there are other grants the child may qualify for that is based on the family&rsquo;s household income.</p><h3> 2. Start saving early.</h3><p> <br/> Time is a huge factor in building any type of savings. Encourage your young adult kids or grandkids to save and start the process early. Twenty-five dollars a month directed towards savings may seem like nothing but if you do it consistently month by month and year over year increasing it as your financial situation improves you will have saved &lsquo;something&rsquo; and &lsquo;something&rsquo; is always better than nothing.</p><p> If your kids or grandkids are earning an income working for you and have a social insurance number direct some of those earnings right into an RRSP for them. If they are younger, they will likely spend their earnings frivolously. There may not be a tax advantage by contributing today. However, they can use the contribution at a later date when there earnings are higher but they will get the benefit of tax deferred compound growth right away.</p><h3> 3. Just save!</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t focus on encouraging saving for retirement to Generation Y. Just encourage saving!</p><p> Thinking about retirement at age 20 is almost ridiculous. Especially for a generation that will have a way different experience of what retirement is or will look like than their parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; retirement. So don&rsquo;t discuss saving for retirement with your twenty-something year-old. Just encourage them to get into a good habit of saving.</p><p> Generation Y should build a personal nest egg for whatever financial goals lay ahead. Encourage them to invest as much money as they can into an RRSP each year &lsquo;just&rsquo; for the tax rebate. This is free money from the Government to persuade us to save! They can take that rebate and either put it back into the RRSP to get more free money next year and continue to build on their savings or look at paying down some high interest debt.</p><p> RRSPs can be much more valuable to Generation Y than just future retirement income. They may help with a down payment on a home (Home Buyers Plan) or fund education for a period of time (Life Long Learning Plan). Both Government plans offer a period of time to pay back the monies into their RRSP&rsquo;s without incurring tax penalties or you can include the withdrawals as income on your tax return and pay tax at whatever bracket you are in.</p><p> Your Generation Y child or grandchild may have a disability at some point in life and have to take a leave from work or decide to stay home to raise kids. If they are in need of a bit of extra income they have their RRSPs to withdraw from. They shouldn&rsquo;t have much of a tax burden (depending on the amounts they withdraw) and assuming they are in a low tax bracket to begin with. Remember when you take monies out of your RRSP you have to include as income on your tax return and pay tax at your marginal rate. So don&rsquo;t take money out for frivolous purchases.</p><h3> 4. Help with building up the savings. If you can.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re the parent or grandparent of an adult child and want to help build their savings beyond just the RESPs here are a few ideas. If Sally or Jimmy are still living at home in their 20s and possibly 30s and are working, make sure you charge them rent. If you can afford it, put that rental income into an account earmarked for them. When the adult child is ready to move out and possibly buy a place of their own you have helped them to save a down payment already. Don&rsquo;t let them know you have put that money aside so they have to learn to budget to find the extra monies to put towards their savings goals. Then money you have saved will just be additional help.</p><p> You can encourage them to set up an RRSP and direct part of the monthly rent into it (hopefully they are financially responsible enough not to touch the funds as they will own the plan). If grandma and grandpa still give cash gifts or want to give a lump sum gift to help out they can also look at RRSPs for longer term savings or a Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA) for shorter term goals. Both have to be opened in the adult child&rsquo;s name and have contribution limitations. Your  <a href=\"http://www.rhondasherwood.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   financial advisor  </u>    </a> can best assist with this.</p><p> There are many ways you can help your Generation Y child or grandchild financially. The best thing you can do is teach and mirror good savings and spending habits.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-08 19:15:03.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-08 19:15:03.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_ny9FWjr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/generation-y-how-you-can-help-your-kids-and-grandkids-survive-financially/\", \"post_id\": \"6644\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-08 19:15:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-08 19:15:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"generation-y-how-you-can-help-your-kids-and-grandkids-survive-financially\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6643\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3055\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/person-cute-vintage-playing-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"856\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444406400,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2969,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Millennials are Shaping the 2016 Presidential Race","link":"how-millennials-are-shaping-the-2016-presidential-race","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OatesStalwart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tyler Hustwick  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.stalwartcom.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Stalwart Communications  </u> </a>  </p><p> Recently, plenty has been said about Millennials, those born between 1981 and 1997. Employers want to know how to manage us, brands want to know how to sell to us and now, politicians and presidential hopefuls want to know how to connect with us. But why are we so damn important? </p><h3> Generation WHY?</h3><p> <br/> According to U.S. Census Bureau and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/16/this-year-millennials-will-overtake-baby-boomers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pew Research Center  </a> </u>  data, as of 2015, the 75.3 million Millennials living in America have officially eclipsed &ldquo;Baby Boomers&rdquo; as the nation&rsquo;s largest living generation. Ranging from 18-34 years old and composing 24% of the nation&rsquo;s population, we as millennials still find ourselves climbing the income ladder, but our group&rsquo;s size and age range showcases our long-term social, economic and political influences.</p><h3> 2008, 2012 and Beyond&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The 2008 election, set the stage for the importance of Millennials and the youth vote. During which, more than half of all eligible youth voters, ages 18-29, took to the polls, accounting for nearly 23 million votes. Compare this to the average youth turnout of the 1990&rsquo;s, which was somewhere near or below 40% and you have an uptick in voting that has certainly caught the attention of those seeking political office. If 2008 wasn&rsquo;t compelling enough, 2012 reaffirmed the importance of the youth vote. According to analysis by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.civicyouth.org/at-least-80-electoral-votes-depended-on-youth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CIRCLE Research Institute  </a> </u> , Mitt Romney would of tip-toed his way to the White House if he had managed split the youth vote. Instead, Barrack Obama easily won over young voters, 67 percent to 30 percent. Had Romney achieved a 50-50 split of youth voters in four key battleground states: Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, he could have flipped those states to his column and in turn, won the election. So in 2015, what are presidential hopefuls doing to connect with the youth vote?</p><h3> Social Media &amp; Then Some</h3><p> <br/> As the 2016 presidential election nears the one year countdown mark, candidates are crawling over every social medium they can find. Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush have already found themselves in a good old fashioned  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/08/hillary-clinton-jeb-bush-epic-photoshop-fight-twitter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter fight  </a> </u> , Ted Cruz Periscopes on the regular, Bernie #FeelTheBern Sanders crushes Facebook with his nearly 2 million followers, Marco Rubio tells &ldquo;Snapchat Stories&rdquo; and Donald Trump&hellip;well The Donald just #YOLOs on social media all day long. </p><p> However, a social media presence isn&rsquo;t the only approach candidates are taking to attract Millennials.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2DgwPG7mAA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Donald Trump  </a> </u> , Hilary Clinton, Jeb Bush and others have flocked to late-night television in the hopes of establishing themselves in the minds of an audience that may not be partial to traditional political news programming and perhaps, to show that they offer a shred of humanity (I mean, what else would persuade Carly Fiorina to do  <u>  this </u> ?).

Has the digital age with its shortened attention spans and 140 character limits shriveled what was once our primary form of engagement? Do we bypass conversation via social channels, which allows it to happen 24/7 when used to it&rsquo;s best advantage, and instead simply continue traditional marketing broadcasting&hellip; for business AND personal.I think unfortunately we have bypassed conversation, but only because &ldquo;we&rdquo; allow it to happen. Part of that is due to the limitations of digital conversation, but part of it is also the fact that we&rsquo;ve become lazy conversationalists since technology has made it look too easy. Most businesses on Social Media, aren&rsquo;t actually looking or encouraging conversation. It seems that unfortunately conversation isn&rsquo;t one of their goals&hellip; even though it should be, and needs to be in order to get the most value.For most, Social Media is a one-way broadcast medium (other than some Twitter efforts at customer service and interaction)&hellip; simply a means of disseminating a message. Conversing, and truly listening&hellip; not so much. And this happens for a variety of reasons, including&hellip; &ldquo;&rdquo;What is the ROI of a conversation and can I track it?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How much unbillable time did you waste on that discussion thread?&rdquo; (a conversation heard at every agency)&hellip; and so on and so forth. We have become spoiled in the digital age and led to believe the only way to have ROI is to be able to track it from first click to sale.The power of social lies in the ability to find, learn, interact, and grow. It&rsquo;s about sharing, creating a connection via conversations, and surrounding yourself friends, fans, followers, consumers who can be part of that growth&hellip; then letting the sales, recommendations, referrals, and sharing come as a result of demonstrable value, good will, and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/porter-ohno-jobs-value-chain-content-wilfried-rijsemus/\" target=\"_blank\">   community  </a> </u>  building that is a result.

In fact, the leaders who promote sustainable achievements challenge their people to think and act for themselves.</p><p> Case in point: An executive told me she was having trouble getting her leadership team to think and act more independently of her \"guidance.\" She said, \"I end up just telling them, do this part then bring it to me and we''ll review it. It's exhausting. And by the way, isn't that what I pay them to do?\"</p><p> Interviewing her leadership team, I saw this was the way she'd always managed them, and they'd \"learned\" that doing things their own way came with penalties. They said, \"She's brilliant but incredibly impatient. When we did things on our own, or our own way, she was all over us, super critical or just ended up doing them herself.\"</p><p> <strong>  Directive versus delegative is a key distinction between manager and leader </strong> , one that, with some practice on her part, helped her and her team deliver their best results. When delegating, it meant she needed to explain why it was important and relevant to do, delegate what she wanted done, and stop telling them how they should do it.</p><p> <strong>  Think about the manager as the quarterback, running each and every play with the team. </strong> A strong leader, in contrast, is more like the coach, guiding the overall effort from the perspective of the big picture; the key strategic and tactical imperatives - and from a careful distance.</p><p> The manager's challenge is <strong>  \"How do I get them to do it with me, my way?\" </strong> But a leader needs to ask the questions that capitalize on his or her investment in people: \"What do I need to change in the way I am delegating to launch them into effective, independent action?\"</p><p> The manager's approach requires constant care -- feeding your people the steps. If your attention turns elsewhere, even briefly, their progress will stall until you give the next directive, all of which eats up a disproportionate amount of your attention, and creates dependency rather than builds capabilities. Good people don't grow in this situation, and they tend to leave -- so overall, this is a recipe for diminishing returns and turnover.</p><p> The leader's approach makes the best use of your time and energy: Give your people the strategic and tactical context, the \"why\" of what you need them to do, and the power to do it their own way, even if it's not the way you would approach it. Let them discover (and learn from) the results they achieve - or fail to achieve -- on their own.</p><p> <strong>  You're paying your key people too much to think for them. </strong> Help them help you by having them think at their best, continuously learn, and hold them accountable for the results rather than focus your energy on how they are achieved.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-08 19:46:07.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-08 19:46:07.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_QDQiifD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/youre-paying-them-too-much-to-think-for-them/\", \"post_id\": \"6653\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-08 19:46:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-08 19:46:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"youre-paying-them-too-much-to-think-for-them\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6652\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3059\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444223771760-5d0e8d119841_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"442\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444418100,"author_id":131,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2972,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Divorced Women and Retirement: Obstacles and Strategies","link":"divorced-women-and-retirement-obstacles-and-strategies","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s not fair, but it&rsquo;s true: Financially healthy retirement is more difficult for women to achieve than it is for men.It&rsquo;s not fair, but it&rsquo;s true: Financially healthy retirement is more difficult for women to achieve than it is for men. If you&rsquo;re married, there is at least some security and comfort in being part of a team that is planning to retire together. If you are divorcing, though, you&rsquo;ll be solely responsible for your own financial well-being into your later years. For you, the financial challenges posed by retirement are both multiplied and magnified.</p><p> Is retirement too daunting even to contemplate? Should you resign yourself to financial dire straits in your future, hoping someone else will take care of you? Absolutely not. Planting your head in the sand is the biggest mistake you could make.</p><p> For every obstacle you&rsquo;ll face, there&rsquo;s a strategy to help work through it. Here&rsquo;s some of what you&rsquo;re up against, and here&rsquo;s how you can strategize to succeed in spite of it.</p><h3> The challenge: Longevity. </h3><p> <br/> The Social Security Administration  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/planners/lifeexpectancy.html\" target=\"_blank\">   reports  </a> </u>  that a man reaching age 65 today can expect to live, on average, until age 84.3. For women, that average life expectancy is 86.6. Women live longer than men; therefore, their retirements can be expected to last longer and cost more. Long life is a good thing! But, you&rsquo;ll need to have more money saved to support those additional years.</p><h3> Your strategy: Save as much as you can.</h3><p> <br/> Think of retirement savings as a commitment. It&rsquo;s not something you do with whatever money you happen to have left over at the end of the month; rather, your savings should be a high priority. Prioritize needs over wants in your spending, and make no mistake: Retirement savings fall squarely into the &ldquo;need&rdquo; column.</p><h3> The challenge: Less income. </h3><p> <br/> Women earn an average of  <u>  77 cents for every dollar earned by men </u> . Earning less means not only do women have less money available to set aside for retirement, but also that their Social Security benefits will be significantly less than what their male counterparts will receive.</p><p> For the married woman, this is troublesome. For the divorced woman, it may be life-changing. With  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/05/17/what-divorcing-women-need-to-know-about-alimony-reform/\" target=\"_blank\">   alimony &ldquo;reform&rdquo;  </a> </u>  sweeping the nation, permanent alimony which would have provided a divorced woman some financial security in her later years has been all but eliminated. Also note that if you were married less than 10 years, you won&rsquo;t be able to collect Social Security benefits based on your ex-husband&rsquo;s earning record.</p><h3> Your strategy: Modify your lifestyle.</h3><p> <br/> As painful as it can be, the reality is that divorce deals a significant financial blow &ndash; and women, unable to recoup those losses in the job market as quickly as their ex-husbands can, take the blow harder and suffer longer from it. Many divorced women simply can&rsquo;t live as they used to while married.</p><p> You might need to live somewhere less expensive. You might need to put off major purchases that aren&rsquo;t absolutely necessary &ndash; no more trading in your car for a new one every three years, for example. Wherever you can cut back on your current spending in favor of saving for the necessities of later life, do it.</p><h3> The challenge: Lower earning potential.</h3><p> <br/> Not only do most women earn less than men, but many women re-entering the job market after time away will find that they simply don&rsquo;t command the income they once did. Taking time away from paid work is a no-win situation, financially. To do a stint as a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/05/29/deciding-to-become-a-sahm-stay-at-home-mom-consider-this-cautionary-tale/\" target=\"_blank\">   stay-at-home-Mom  </a> </u> , women sacrifice their peak earning years and career momentum. Unfortunately, many of them don&rsquo;t fully realize the financial ramifications of that decision until it&rsquo;s too late.</p><h3> Your strategy: Work with professionals.</h3><p> <br/> Re-entering the work force, you want to earn the most you possibly can. It&rsquo;s worth your time to consult with a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2012/10/24/four-reasons-why-a-woman-needs-a-vocational-expert-on-her-divorce-team/\" target=\"_blank\">   vocational expert  </a> </u>  to see where your education and skills command the highest income in the job market where you live. Don&rsquo;t waste time and energy floundering around the want ads. Talk to an expert who can focus your efforts for optimum results.</p><h3> The challenge: Less savings.</h3><p> <br/> When you earn less, you save less. But even when women save aggressively, they are often saving for things other than their own retirements! I&rsquo;ve known women to ignore planning for their futures to make sure instead that there is money for their child&rsquo;s college tuition or first home. As much as you might want to give your children a financial leg up, it can do more harm than good if your own financial health is at risk.</p><h3> Your strategy: Get on it early, and stay focused.</h3><p> <br/> As a divorced woman, you need to begin your retirement savings as soon as possible. If you are in the settlement negotiation process, make sure your team is advocating for terms that will serve you well where retirement is concerned.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be derailed from your retirement savings. Meet your own needs first, then see what you can do toward other goals.</p><h3> The challenge: Less financial literacy.</h3><p> <br/> In general, women are less familiar with financial matters and report less confidence in their ability to invest than men. I think this is a problem even for happily married women, but for divorced women, lack of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/03/06/financial-literacy-the-key-to-every-womans-financial-stability/\" target=\"_blank\">   financial literacy  </a> </u>  is a problem with immediate and potentially severe consequences. If you left the major financial decisions to your husband during your marriage, you won&rsquo;t have much know-how for investing when you&rsquo;re divorced. Without that basic competence, a retirement savings strategy may seem out of reach.</p><h3> Your response: Educate yourself. </h3><p> <br/> Devote time and effort to learning the basics of personal financial management and investing. There&rsquo;s nothing about this that can&rsquo;t be learned &ndash; it&rsquo;s a skill just like any other, and if you commit to getting up to speed, you will.</p><p> With a commitment to sensible retirement planning strategies, there is good reason for you to expect a financially secure retirement. On the other hand, without it, there is good cause for concern. I sincerely hope you&rsquo;ll make your secure retirement a priority, and not a reason to worry.</p><p> <strong>  Reminder:  </strong> As a divorced woman planning retirement, there&rsquo;s no question that the cards are stacked against you. While it can be disheartening to face that reality, face it you must! If you put off thinking about it, you&rsquo;re headed for serious regrets.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip: </strong>  To make your divorce settlement last as long as possible and minimize your tax exposure, consult with a financial advisor. For the most appropriate guidance, find someone with expertise in the specific financial needs of divorced women.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters:  </strong> The various mechanisms for retirement savings present different tax advantages and consequences. The regulations and legalese governing these things can be substantial, but fear not! Working with your financial advisor, you&rsquo;ll soon be up to speed on the basics. The more your financial literacy grows, the less complicated these things will seem to you.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-08 19:53:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-08 19:53:04.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_NSes8E5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/divorced-women-and-retirement-obstacles-and-strategies/\", \"post_id\": \"6655\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-08 19:53:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-08 19:53:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"divorced-women-and-retirement-obstacles-and-strategies\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6654\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3060\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1414432690990-dd3b7442fd9d.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"532\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444410000,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}

That means, posting consistently, answering consistently, being available consistently. When we are consistent, it shows our audience we are reliable and trustworthy without having to say it. And as the old adage goes, actions speak louder than words.</li><li> <strong>  Social media requires ethical practices. </strong>  While some believe they can lambast their way into social media stardom, I must warn you &ndash; there&rsquo;s a process and procedure. No, there isn&rsquo;t. But there is an ethical and unethical way to do many things. Ethics and social media is a HUGE subject that I don&rsquo;t have the time or space to get into for this article, but it mostly comes down to: treat people the way you want to be treated. Do you like auto DM&rsquo;s? Do you appreciate spam in your LinkedIn inbox? Do you dig it when some stranger you just followed sends you some automated message asking you do something without even saying hi?? Don&rsquo;t do what you don&rsquo;t want done to you.</li><li> <strong>  Social media requires time. </strong>   <a href=\"http://ahnahendrix.com/be-patient-social-media-takes-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Successful social media isn&rsquo;t an overnight game  </u>    </a> nor is it one that can be cheated. We can&rsquo;t jump to the middle and have anything other but momentary results. You must buckle in and be consistent for a long time. Don&rsquo;t get frustrated or blame it on the social networks &ndash; they&rsquo;re offering you free communities in which to meet and sell to your target customer &ndash; that rocks! Instead, learn about them, educate yourself, and be patient. It&rsquo;s typically the time that someone is about to give up when a breakthrough occurs.</li><li> <strong>  Social media requires continual education. </strong>  This isn&rsquo;t an industry where you can start, read a few books, and be an expert &ndash; regardless of what you see others touting. This is an industry built for those of us who get bored easily and always need a change because there&rsquo;s one almost everyday &ndash; literally. Someone said, Knowledge is power, and it&rsquo;s important in social media, but experience reigns. More than anything, you want both, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to read/test/try/read/test/try again and again, until you find what works. And guess what, when you do &ndash; you&rsquo;ll need to change it up again. This is a topsy-turvy industry, so either you&rsquo;re hip or you should hire someone who is. <br/>  </li><p> Now that we&rsquo;ve outlined a few rules, here&rsquo;s the 3 different strategies you MUST use in conjunction for successful social media. I&rsquo;ll outline and explain them.</p><h3> Email marketing</h3><p> <br/> If email marketing isn&rsquo;t the bread and butter of your business &ndash; it should be. Had I listened to the pros and started building my email list when I first launched my business I&rsquo;d be much farther along.</p><p> Email marketing gives you the opportunity to reach people on their most intimate level &ndash; the inbox. It gives you access to a place people fiercely protect these days, and you&rsquo;ll have to earn their trust to keep it.</p><p> But the most important reason email marketing is so crucial is that it&rsquo;s the ONLY channel YOU own. No matter what Facebook or Twitter or any of the social networks decide to do or update &ndash; your email list will alwayssssss be yours.</p><p> It can&rsquo;t be bought (hopefully) and that makes it solid gold. Solid. Gold. Folks.</p><p> <strong>  Make it actionable: </strong> <br/> 1. Sign up with an email provider. Mailchimp or Weber are my recommendations for newbies. <br/> 2. Create an opt-in that will entice others to sign up for your email newsletter &ndash; ebook, infographic, training videos, etc. It needs to add value, regardless of what it is. <br/> 3. Strategize how you will communicate with your audience &ndash; weekly, monthly? Whatever you decide, make it consistent. <br/> 4. Use Hello bar or a good pop-up box to promote your offering and get the attention of readers. <br/> 5. Start sending out newsletters!</p><h3> Content Creation</h3><p> <br/> Content creation can seem like a vague notion, but it&rsquo;s simply: written or visual content, i.e. blogging, videos, graphics, etc.</p><p> Blogging has been around for a longgg time, but it&rsquo;s still one of the most trusted ways for an audience to get to know you, trust you, and learn what you&rsquo;re all about. People love to read, especially when you make it fun and educational.</p><p> Visual content is all the rage these days &ndash; photos, graphics, GIFs, and videos. People love it!! And they should &ndash; it&rsquo;s much more personal than a blog and can tell a long story in a single snapshot or within a few minutes.</p><p> Bottom line &ndash; content creation is what makes your social media channels stand out. Native content is KING these days, hands down. You need it, gotta have it, and the brands who naturally produce a lot of content are rising quickly.</p><p> So your new task is going to be figuring out how you can produce a lot more of it.</p><p> <strong>  Make it actionable: </strong> <br/> 1. Create a blogging schedule and stick to it! <br/> 2. Decide whether videos would be of use to your audience, if so, create a video publishing schedule. <br/> 3. Take regular photos of your workday, business, personal life &ndash; anything that aligns with work and/or could be used to correlate with your brand for online sharing <br/> 4. Create graphics with Canva (or another similar tool) that showcase powerful quotes in your blogs, motivational quotes, cue cards for events/Blabs/Periscopes/etc. <br/> 5. Live streaming &ndash; does it align with your business objectives? If so, jump in &ndash; the water is jussst fine. <br/> 6. Brainstorm about other ways to create content with your team, a smart friend or ask your audience for ideas. <br/>  </p><h3> Social media marketing</h3><p> <br/> The deal is, when email marketing and content creation are happening regularly and consistently, your social media presence will automatically be amplified. They will not only infuse your feeds with excellent content, but offer new ways to share it.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no short way to talk about good social media practices without launching into a whole new blog, but I will say there&rsquo;s a few key things to keep in mind.</p><li> Don&rsquo;t try to be everywhere. Research which 2-3 social networks host your target audience and begin there. Once you&rsquo;ve laid a solid (I mean, 3-6 month solid) foundation then you can branch out.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t start up a social network and manage it haphazardly. If you&rsquo;re going to do it, do it right &ndash; commit and be consistent. And that means it&rsquo;s okay if all you can handle are 1-2 social networks to start with. Social media marketing is not a race and quality ALWAYS beats out quantity.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t become an automator. The only reason automation was invented was to give marketers and biz owners more freedom to do what we should be doing &ndash; engaging and developing relationships. Social media is NOT auto replies on Twitter, spam on LinkedIn or trying to exchange Like for Like on Facebook.  <strong>  That&rsquo;s CRAP marketing &ndash; don&rsquo;t do it. </strong></li><li> Don&rsquo;t be negative. Do your best to refrain from negative discussion/talk at all costs. Be the light in your world and share uplifting and valuable content.</li><li> Post with purpose. This is another one of my universal social media truths. If you are purposeful with all your online decisions and content &ndash; everything will work out wonderfully. Don&rsquo;t just post something because you&rsquo;ve got nothing, plan ahead and know what steps to take if you run out of content. Plan every. thing.</li><li> Social media networks are the pipelines to tell your story and share your content &ndash; you can&rsquo;t solely rely on ANY social network for total success. And never forget, you don&rsquo;t own any of the social networks, so they could change it all up on your any day. <br/>  </li><p> The main takeaway from this blog is that you need ALL 3 core strategies to be successful with online marketing: email marketing, content creation, and social media marketing. Create content that displays the intelligence and ethics of your brand, send valuable and personal information via email newsletters, and spread the word via social media.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-08 20:01:04.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-08 20:01:04.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_i9rvafL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-recipe-for-successful-social-media-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"6657\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-08 20:01:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-08 20:01:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-recipe-for-successful-social-media-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6658\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3061\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pexels-photo-large_11.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"548\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444395600,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2974,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Trust Me, I'm A Robo-Advisor","link":"trust-me-im-a-robo-advisor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We always want to complete things, and it makes everything interesting when it comes to the psychology of money.  It is the reason why all the offers you get are for 9.99 or 99.99.  It makes you feel it&rsquo;s cheaper than 10 or 100.  It is also why we stand at the gas station filling the car with fuel and are never happy if the pump reads 37.98 or 38.02.  We want exactly 38 in the tank, not &ndash; or + .02 either side.</p><p> Part of the reason I mention this is that we are moving to a world of electronic ledgers.  In so doing, we must remember the psychology of money, as money is a real thing.  Money dominates our lives and allows us to reward our desires or to have to postpone them.  How do we control our balance in a digital world?</p><p> I wonder this myself.  I have multiple credit card accounts, a wide range of investment vehicles, a small number of loans and a mortgage.  I have no idea of my net balance. </p><p> Sure we have aggregators who can do this, but why would I trust an aggregator with all my financial information?  Equally, who can I trust with my complete portfolio of debits and credits in a snapshot, who can advise me at a micro transaction level, every second of every day.</p><p> The robo-advisor?</p><p> This is where it is claimed there is opportunity.  It is an opportunity for someone to bring together the micro and the macro level of money and engage the consumer, the mass affluent and the high net worth with a real-time ledger and balance system.</p><p> Some will say they&rsquo;ve already cracked it, but most lean towards either a macro view or a micro view.  We either have a robo-advisor or a PFM.  Some will say they&rsquo;ve cracked it, but do they have the client engagement?  As regularly mentioned in this blog, a new name without a licence is not a trusted name.  I recently attended a conference where an influential CEO said that FinTech firms are about as trustworthy as a guy on a street corner selling from the trunk of his car.  I wouldn&rsquo;t quite go that far but there is a grain of truth in the statement.</p><p> The U.S. has recently seen the rise of  companies like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/network-links/31\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wealthfront  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/network-links/2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Betterment  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/network-links/24\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FutureAdvisor  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/network-links/1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Personal Capital  </a> </u> .  They are the robo-advisors.  They offer wealth management and micro PFM in a combination that is meant to be the killer app.  Their features are finely tuned &ndash; you can find many comparisons but this one from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/online-advisor-comparison/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nerd Wallet  </a> </u>  gives you the low down &ndash; but if their focus is on your assets, then maybe they aren&rsquo;t all they seem.</p><p> Equally, they are not regulated in the same way as traditional institutions.  For example, in May 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) released a joint alert warning investors to make sure they understand the risks, limitations and fees charged by automated investment tools before using them.</p><p> There&rsquo;s lots of advice in  <u>  the alert </u>  from making sure that you understand the robo-advisor&rsquo;s outputs are only as good as the inputs, and that it may not be the right financial tool for you.  Some of the robo-advisors are registered with the SEC and responded to this alert to clarify their position.  Here's  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/resources/inside-betterment/our-story/sec-finra-what-is-automated-investing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Betterment's statement  </a> </u> :</p><p> KEY TAKEAWAYS</p><li> The joint alert is one of the first publications from either the SEC or FINRA that recognizes the category of automated investing, which we created when we launched in May 2010.</li><li> The benefits of automated investing for consumers include low costs, ease of use, and broad access. <br/>  </li><p> It still wouldn't cut it for some however, because we&rsquo;ve had aggregation tools around for a long time &ndash; Yodlee were big back ten years ago &ndash; but none of the aggregators have thrived in Europe.  This is because European regulators don&rsquo;t like some of them.  Just look at the ruling on the EU-USA data sharing act this week -  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-faces-disruption-in-europe-as-us-data-sharing-pact-declared-illegal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   US-Europe data-sharing pact declared illegal  </a> </u>  - and you can see how we are no longer blindly trusting our American counterparts to protect our data.  That's why the SEC alert gave one piece of advice that screamed out to me: &ldquo;unless you are accessing an account that you established, do not provide bank or brokerage account numbers, passwords, PINs, credit card information, Social Security numbers, or other personally identifiable information&rdquo;.  An untrusted company without a licence having access to PINs and passwords is like giving the guy with the car the key to your house.  That ain&rsquo;t good.</p><p> So will the robo-advisors thrive outside the USA?  Will they even survive in the USA?  This is a good question.  The most likely outcome is that the robo-advisor will end up as some sort of Trusted Third Party, TTP (see PSD2).  A TTP has  light license, whilst a bank has a heavy one.  Either way, you gotta have a licence.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-08 20:04:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-08 20:04:51.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_9cAeYVM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/trust-me-im-a-robo-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"6660\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-08 20:04:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-08 20:04:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"trust-me-im-a-robo-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6659\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3062\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1424821248018.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1058\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444411800,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

But&hellip;It was the promise of freedom on the open road and I could not wait to test its upper limits, if you know what I mean! Sensing my enthusiasm, one of the mantras that my dad drilled into me was, &ldquo;never accelerate into a closing gap.&rdquo; Indeed, remembering this advice&mdash;sometimes at the last moment&mdash;saved me from some hair-raising moments, or worse.</p><p> <strong>  As the years passed and my career unfolded, I came to learn that this mantra had a figurative as well as a literal application. </strong> Here&rsquo;s the reality: trying to cover an error with what turns out to be another error will always end in disaster.

But we also need to consider what&rsquo;s needed to help women succeed once they&rsquo;re in this role.</p><h3> Leverage and parity</h3><p> <br/> You may ask why I (someone who usually writes about social media) am tackling this issue here? (Hint: it&rsquo;s not just because I&rsquo;m a woman.) In addition to my work in social media marketing, I&rsquo;m also on the board of the SEI Women&rsquo;s Network. We regularly conduct networking events and educational programs designed to inspire and support women&rsquo;s professional growth.

Here are 10 key ways you can use it grow your individual brand and build your business:</p><li> <strong>  Join (or create) a community. </strong>  Talk to other female (and male) financial advisors who are doing well. What technologies are they using? Marketing techniques? Vendors and investment partners? Bounce your ideas for new initiatives off of this group. Whether a study group, conference, or informal group of friends, these colleagues can help you uncover what&rsquo;s working.</li><li> <strong>  Perfect your elevator pitch.  </strong> Who are you? Who do you serve? What services do you provide that can help target that niche? And just because you&rsquo;re female, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that your niche has to be female investors &ndash; that&rsquo;s way too broad (no pun intended). Advisors like  <u>  Newlin Archinal </u>  of Integrity Wealth Consulting in Pittsburgh, for example, specialize in working with selected companies or investors who may have experienced a downsizing. You have to understand the specific needs of your niche and be able to speak to that group.</li><li> <strong>  Have a sales script. </strong> After getting introduced to a qualified prospect, you need to have a script to introduce your services. The queen of marketing to female financial advisors, Adri Miller Heckman, provides  <a href=\"http://adrimillerheckman.com/prospecting-script-for-financial-advisors-made-easy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   an example here  </u>  .  </a></li><li> <strong>  Be Google-able.  </strong> A big mistake that I see from female and male advisors alike is not showing personality on their LinkedIn profiles and websites. Completely fill out your profile and update your website with all the ways you help your clients. Provide real-life case studies of how you&rsquo;ve helped others. Share pictures of you, your clients, and your office. It&rsquo;ll go a long way in getting you found and encouraging prospects to want to take the next step in meeting with you vs. some other advisor.</li><li> <strong>  Host events. </strong> At our 2015 National Strategic Advisor Council meeting, we convened a study group of the most successful female advisors in the industry. We heard two differing, yet complementary approaches. Some advisors recommended having completely social events &ndash; such an evening of painting and wine tasting (as done by  <u>  Sheryl Austin </u> , Partner at DMJ Wealth Advisors in North Carolina). Other advisors stressed the need to have events that had &ldquo;meat and potatoes&rdquo; of real investment content, but presented in an easy-to-understand way. Female advisors tend to work with female investors, so  <u>  <a href=\"http://adrimillerheckman.com/prospecting-script-for-financial-advisors-made-easy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   workshops around retirement readiness specifically for women could be a good topic  </a>  . </u> With either approach, be sure to show personality, and empathize with your clients and prospects &ndash; you&rsquo;ll relate to potential investors in a deeper way.</li><li> <strong>  Embrace social media. </strong>  Not only do  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/2014/03/social-media-and-women/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   women use social media at higher rates than men  </a> </u> , but interestingly, they use social media differently. Women primarily use social networking sites to make connections and stay in touch with family or friends; men gather the information they need to build influence. Combine your natural ability to network and stay in touch with the ability to conduct research and gather relevant contacts &ndash; it will ultimately increase your status and build your business. (How? See some of  <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/author/asitnick/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   my other articles on social media  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/author/asitnick/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a> for tips.)</li><li> <strong>  Consider a coach. </strong>  Whether it&rsquo;s a formal or informal mentor relationship, there is real value in getting feedback on your work and having an impartial opinion on your business. There are many coaching programs available to financial advisors. Take one for a test drive and see if you find it useful.</li><li> <strong>  Get connected to your local community. </strong> Many advisors believe strongly in philanthropy. Make it part of your firm culture. Volunteering not only feels good, but further builds your network. You can showcase your volunteer efforts on your firm&rsquo;s website, as well as on LinkedIn and Facebook. Invite clients to participate in your efforts &ndash; whether a clothing drive, food drive, or trip to a shelter, to maximize efforts and share in the good will.</li><li> <strong>  Get published. </strong>  It&rsquo;s easier than ever to get published as a financial advisor and there&rsquo;s great value in sharing your expertise. Consider a firm blog on your website or test the LinkedIn Publisher platform to get broad readership of your content. Topics should center on your firm&rsquo;s value proposition and what&rsquo;s of interest to the niche that you serve. Once you&rsquo;ve written articles, you can further leverage them by sharing them with reporters who may have an interest in re-publishing the article in full or citing you as an expert. And of course, if you&rsquo;re really passionate about a selected topic and have built up content, articles can be republished into an eBook or printed book.</li><li> <strong>  Maximize referrals.  </strong> Rather than asking clients for referrals, paint them a picture. For example, mention that you&rsquo;ve recently been helping a number of divorcees and widows who are feeling insecure and nervous about overseeing their household finances, then ask if they have friends who are going through something similar.</li><h3> Stay inspired</h3><p> <br/> Whether you do yoga, travel, go for walks, or visit museums, I find that it&rsquo;s crucial for women to remain energized and centered in their personal life, so that they can open themselves up to business success.</p><p> What other support mechanisms do you think women advisors need to succeed?

{"original_id":2978,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Shifting College Tuition Payments to Retirement Savings Isn't Easy","link":"shifting-college-tuition-payments-to-retirement-savings-isnt-easy","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  College graduation is obviously a cause for celebration. </strong> When the graduate is the youngest child, some parents have an extra reason to rejoice: no more tuition payments.</p><p> At the end of the college years, many parents who have chosen to fund their kids' education find themselves behind on funding their own retirement. One popular solution is to plan on diverting the tuition payments to retirement plans as the kids leave college.</p><p> On paper, it's a great solution. No change in lifestyle or cash flow is required. Whatever has gone out for college tuition, gas, housing, and books now is just diverted to a 401(k) or IRA. What could be simpler and less painful?</p><p> The problem is this rarely works. Over some 35 years of helping people plan for retirement, rarely have I seen parents actually shift tuition payments to retirement savings.</p><h3> This is because saving is an emotional rather than cognitive activity.</h3><p> <br/> We don&rsquo;t think our way to saving, we feel our way to saving. This is confirmed by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s research, which found that 90% of all financial decisions are made emotionally.</p><p> Several emotional factors get in the way of couples' intent to focus on their own retirement savings when they become empty nesters.</p><p> <strong>  1. By the time the kids start college, </strong> if parents haven&rsquo;t already built up college funds and made a good start on retirement funds there are likely to be deeper emotional reasons they are not saving. Many who retire comfortably began planning for their retirement as soon as they finished college themselves and started saving for college when their kids were babies. Those without that early habit of saving are less likely to start in middle age.</p><p> <strong>  2. Parents who have focused on helping their kids through four years of college may find it extremely challenging to stop. </strong> The emotional habit of helping can easily find ongoing expenses to pay. Kids may want to go to graduate school, need help until they find permanent jobs, or want to buy homes. The list is endless.</p><p> <strong>  3. Parents who can stop helping their kids often have a hard time not rewarding themselves when the tuition payments end. </strong> Even though they planned to divert the funds to their retirement account, there often is an unanticipated pent-up demand for unmet needs placed on hold during all the children's college years. Sometimes the new spending isn&rsquo;t unanticipated. How often have you heard someone say, \"When the kids are gone, we'll be able to afford . . .\"? What would a vacation to the Bahamas or a new car hurt before going back to the austerity budget? In reality, once the dam of newfound discretionary income breaks, it&rsquo;s rarely reconstructed.</p><p> The best time to break this spending pattern is before it's created. Here are some ideas:</p><p> <strong>  1. Remember, research has found it costs children much more to take care of a parent in retirement than fund their own college education. </strong> Taking care of your own retirement first may well be in your kids' best interest as well as your own.</p><p> <strong>  2. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be either/or. Consider options like only funding part of the college bill. </strong> Your children won't implode if they must work their way through. One Berkeley study actually found that kids who worked 20 hours a week had higher GPA's than their counterparts who got a free ride.</p><p> <strong>  3. Finally, be willing to look at your own emotional issues around money. </strong> Resolving your own emotional barriers to saving may be the best investment you can make, not only for your own future but for your children.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 14:45:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 14:45:53.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_Ck6KI7s.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/shifting-college-tuition-payments-to-retirement-savings-isnt-easy/\", \"post_id\": \"6668\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 14:45:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 14:45:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"shifting-college-tuition-payments-to-retirement-savings-isnt-easy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6667\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3066\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444410118176-e9e3e289ce89.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"441\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444651200,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2979,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"15 Ways to Handle the Competition Objection","link":"15-ways-to-handle-the-competition-objection","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We all face competition.  There is always someone who can do it cheaper, or faster, or better (at least in the mind of your prospect).  Because of this, prospects &ndash; and even customers &ndash; are constantly on the search for a better deal.  Knowing how to handle the competition objection effectively can mean the difference between winning the sale or suffering that sinking feeling of having lost the business to someone else.</p><p> There are several times you can handle the competition objection, but surprisingly most sales reps wait until it comes up at the end of their closing presentation.  This is the worse time to handle it because you have already g iven your pricing and options and sometimes even your best deal.  While you may have to handle the objection of competition during the close &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll give you some scripting to do just that later in this article &ndash; the best time to handle it is in the beginning, while qualifying.  Here are some ways you can do that:</p><p> Qualifying for competition:</p><h3> Option #1:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;_________, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about who else you&rsquo;re looking at for this &ndash; who&rsquo;s top of your list right now?&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable bringing up potential competition, let me assure you of two things: One, if they are shopping you, they are most likely shopping others, so don&rsquo;t be surprised, and Two, trust me, it&rsquo;s better to know in advance who you&rsquo;re up against so you can position yourself to win the business during the close.  And always ask this in an assumptive way&hellip;</p><h3> Option #2:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;How many companies are you getting quotes on for this?&rdquo;</p><p> Once again, don&rsquo;t worry about introducing the concept of getting quotes, if they are going to do this (and most are), it&rsquo;s better to get an idea of it now.  If they tell you they are getting three quotes (doesn&rsquo;t matter how many), layer this with: &ldquo;And who have you liked so far?&rdquo;  Again, be assumptive with this.</p><h3> Option #3:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;_________, how does your current supplier fit into all this?&rdquo; </p><p> This is a nice opened ended, assumptive way to get your prospect to reveal why they might be moving away from their current vendor &ndash; or why they might still be considering using them.  A great way to layer this is to ask:</p><h3> Option #4:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;And if you find that we can give you a better deal than you&rsquo;re getting right now, what will you do next?&rdquo;</p><p> Obviously you want them to reveal that they&rsquo;ll take it back to their current vendor to get them to lower their price, and this is what you want to know in advance.  Asking this question in an opened ended way like this often gets them to tell you this.  You can also ask this in a more direct way:</p><h3> Option #5:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;________, if we can show you how we can take care of what you&rsquo;re doing now, and do so for less than you&rsquo;re paying your current vendor, what will prevent you from taking it back to them and getting them to just drop their price to keep your business?&rdquo;</p><p> Listen carefully to not only what your prospect says here, but how they say it.  If they hesitate or if their voice goes up or wavers a bit, then you&rsquo;re in trouble.  You can also handle it this way:</p><h3> Option #6:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Now _________, after we do our analysis, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that we&rsquo;ll be able to save you money just like we do our other clients.  But ________, I have a concern and I need you to level with me: Sometimes we go through this work to find these savings, and after we do, some companies use them to get their current vendor to lower their prices.  Do you see what I mean?&rdquo;</p><p> [Wait for response]</p><p> &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m happy to do the work for you and show you some savings, but let me ask you: what is the chance that you&rsquo;ll take these back to your current vendor and do the same?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Let me ask you: if we can also show you savings, what would prevent you from doing the same?&rdquo; </p><h3> Option #7:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;________, what is going to be the deciding factor on who wins your business on this?&rdquo;</p><p> And if it&rsquo;s price, then layer with:</p><p> &ldquo;O.K., then after you get all the quotes, will you at least let me compete against the lowest quote to see if I can do better?&rdquo;</p><p> Handling competition during the close: If after you&rsquo;ve presented your product or service your prospect says they want or need to check on other offers/estimates/quotes, then use the questions below to get your prospect to open up and possibly reveal what it might take for you to win the business:</p><h3> Option #1:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I understand, which way are you leaning right now?&rdquo;</p><h3> Option #2:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;What would it take for someone else to win your business?&rdquo;</p><h3> Option #3:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;What would it honestly take for you to choose us for this?&rdquo;</p><h3> Option #4:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you see with our proposal that you see in others?&rdquo;</p><h3> Option #5:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Are we in the running with what else you&rsquo;ve seen out there?&rdquo;</p><p> [If yes]</p><p> &ldquo;What about us would take us out of the running?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What would you need to see to choose using us?&rdquo;  </p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;What can I do right now to insure that we win your business?&rdquo;</p><h3> Option #6:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Obviously you&rsquo;re going to show this quote to your current vendor &ndash; if they match the price, will you just stick with them?&rdquo;</p><p> [If yes]</p><p> &ldquo;What can I do to prevent that?&rdquo;</p><h3> Option #7:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;How many times have you taken other quotes to your current vendor?&rdquo;</p><p> [If they tell you]:</p><p> &ldquo;And what do they usually do?&rdquo;</p><p> [If they say they lower their price to keep the business]:</p><p> &ldquo;How can we break that cycle and get you the right pricing from the start?&rdquo;</p><h3> Option #8:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;_________, let&rsquo;s take your lowest bid right now and compare it &ndash; services to services &ndash; to what we&rsquo;re offing you.

{"original_id":2981,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What to Do With Client Complaints","link":"what-to-do-with-client-complaints","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Customer complaints are a fact of life.   </strong> It is virtually impossible to run a service business where everyone is happy 100% of the time, as human beings are involved and they are unpredictable creatures.  The art of good customer complaint handling is knowing when to fight and when to just fix it.</p><p> The customer is always right?  </p><p> <strong>  No they&rsquo;re not! </strong></p><p> I don&rsquo;t subscribe to the theory that &ldquo;the customer is always right&rdquo;.  They aren&rsquo;t.  Some are stupid and unreasonable.  Or just downright unfair.  Some actually deliberately try to obtain a benefit for themselves that they KNOW they aren&rsquo;t entitled to at somebody else&rsquo;s expense.</p><h3> Customers aren&rsquo;t always right &ndash; especially not complaining customers.</h3><p> <br/> A complaint in practical terms is anything which is an expression of dissatisfaction by a customer.  Dissatisfaction can, and often is, warranted.  Dissatisfaction is the gap between expectations and experience.</p><p> Staff and advisers cut corners, have distractions in their life, and they have bad days.  That&rsquo;s life.  Customers have bad days too, and distractions in their life, and sometimes there is a disconnect between what they thought would happen and what we thought would happen, and we can all argue forever over who should have understood what without ever resolving that.  The end result is that there is an enormous number of potential opportunities on any given day for there to be a gap between a customers expectations, and the actual experience they have with our business.</p><p> Regardless of the rights or wrongs of it, customers are always consumers with voices who can (and often will) do enormous damage to a business reputation if that dissatisfaction is not resolved.  For the practice manager, or owner, this means that regardless of the right or wrong of it we have to make a commercial decision to protect ourselves and our brand &ndash; even perhaps when the customer is not right.</p><h3> Quick Triage Questions before you categorise complaints</h3><p> <br/> So when a complaint turns up we have to figure out pretty quickly:</p><li>  is the complaint legitimate?</li><li> is the customer being reasonable?</li><li> is my (or the firms) brand going to take a hit if we get this wrong?</li><li> would it be best if we just made this go away quickly?</li><li> OR&hellip;is this a big enough deal, which is either potentially so damaging or is something which challenges our values, that we must fight it to maintain our integrity? <br/>  </li><p> If the answer to Question 5 is &ldquo;YES&rdquo; &ndash; then fight it. But that is one of the only 2 times to to fight it.  The other is when the fight started before you even knew there was a problem (for example; litigation or dispute proceedings are your first indicator).  When Pearl Harbour happens to you on an otherwise pleasant Sunday morning, you are left with no choice but to fight, because the fight started without you.</p><p> On any other occasion though we have an opportunity to take the grumpy face and turn it into a smiley face.</p><p> Handling any complaint involves time, and stress, and resources that could be better employed elsewhere.  There is a cost to us in other words, even if we ultimately are proven to be &ldquo;right&rdquo;.  If we do go through a process of proving how right we are, and how wrong the customers complaint is, we then incur the ill-will of an aggrieved customer as well as the aforementioned costs.  It is virtually impossible to quantify what the potential cost is of us fighting a relatively minor complaint just so we can prove how right we were, but it will usually be a lot more than most practitioners think.</p><p> Almost inevitably there will be some form of physical cost involved in putting things right for the customer at the end of it all as well.  In a best case scenario in other words, we have a customer who is no longer disgruntled, but is still probably not fully gruntled because of the process we have just gone through.  We are stressed, and it cost a lot of downtime&hellip;and all that for a customer who is now probably going to leave us and have a bit to say about how painful we were.</p><h3> The Best Course Of Action</h3><p> <br/> The best course of action is to pretend that the customer is right.  I say &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; because that is what we have to do &ndash; we might know we are right, but we have to put that knowledge to one side, and treat the customer as if they were right.</p><p> Then make a good commercial decision.</p><p> Bring the cost to the front of the process.  Use it to create genuine good will and delight that customer.  Avoid the protracted and painful process that results in equivalent doses of unhappiness, and just bring the end result right up to the front of the process. Ask the question:</p><h3> &ldquo;What do I need to do to make this right for you?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Money is perhaps a solution, but often enough it isn&rsquo;t about money.  It is about &ldquo;putting things right&rdquo; and doing it with 100% attention so they know that they are valued.  But then spend a little bit of the money that it would otherwise have cost you to introduce a bit of awesomeness. Surprise and delight them with something unexpected over and above the &ldquo;putting it right&rdquo;.</p><p> The end result is that if you approach the complaints this way they will tend to be resolved a heck of a lot more quickly, and result in happy clients who are closer to being warm advocates for your business rather than snipers gunning for you.  The key is asking the right questions at the front end, and understanding when it has to be a fight, and when the fight should just be avoided.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 16:36:48.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 16:36:48.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_LjjIzO5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-to-do-with-client-complaints/\", \"post_id\": \"6674\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 16:36:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 16:36:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-to-do-with-client-complaints\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6673\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3069\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-11-at-9.42.02-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1186\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444653000,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2982,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Is Your Firm an Attractive Acquisition Target?","link":"is-your-firm-an-attractive-acquisition-target","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Paul Barrett, CEO, <a href=\"http://www.aznga.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   AZ Next Generation Advisory  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Since launching AZ Next Generation Advisory earlier in the year, I have received a lot of questions about what our ideal target firm looks like. I reckon I get asked this question on a daily basis. My off-the-cuff answer usually included words like profitable, growing, quality, client segmentation, corporatisation and the like. </strong></p><p> If I&rsquo;m brutally honest gut feel has played a large role as well. Knowing the people in charge helps too, as does understanding their financials in detail. In any case I have been able to compare and contrast a lot of firms recently as well as over my career. I&rsquo;d like to present here the things that I believe make a firm &lsquo;attractive&rsquo;.</p><p> <strong>  Firstly I&rsquo;d like to state the obvious. Not all firms are equal! </strong> If you were to build an &ldquo;attractiveness index&rdquo; and rank all firms based on their key drivers of &ldquo;attractiveness&rdquo; you&rsquo;d probably end up with a normal distribution, or bell curve. What is it about the firms at the right edge of the bell curve that makes them so successful?</p><p> If you consult any of the number of &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; manuals or consulting firms they will tell you that these firms are organised, efficient, corporatised, have eliminated key person risk, and have built a sustainable going concern. These concepts all work in theory of course. They are well thought out conventions gracing conference agendas and PD days all over the industry, probably all over the world.</p><p> As compelling as these conventions are, they are somewhat idealistic. One session with a consultant talking about this stuff would leave most mere mortal business owners feeling very inadequate indeed. I&rsquo;ve spent over 20 years working in very large, well-resourced institutions (some very successful ones) and they would find it difficult to measure up to these supposed best practice ideals.</p><p> <strong>  Some of the best practice ideals could potentially destroy value. </strong> For example, I always hear the theory that says you must eliminate key person risk. It sounds good in theory, and there is some real benefit in ensuring no individual has all the power, however it&rsquo;s a notion that is fanciful. When I think about successful sports teams, rock bands, and corporations, there is normally some spectacular individual talent involved. Would the Rolling Stones be the Rolling Stones without Mick or Keef? Or would they being playing the suburban pub scene like my band!?</p><p> So in the spirit of keeping it real, <strong>  the first thing I look for is the involvement of a visionary leader, </strong> someone who has driven the business through tough times, who is able to unite those around them. This person shouldn&rsquo;t have all the client and supplier relationships (which is what I think the consultants are on about), but they will provide the critical ingredient of CLEAR LEADERSHIP.</p><p> <strong>  The clear leadership will be accompanied by VISION &amp; A LONG TERM PLAN. </strong> The best definition of vision I have come across is &ldquo;being able to see around corners&rdquo;. The leader or leadership group of the most successful practices takes a long term view and tries to anticipate different future scenarios. For instance, those businesses that switched to fee-for-service ten years before FOFA had vision. They saw an inevitable shift in the landscape and adjusted early.</p><p> The best practice manuals all talk about having an organised approach to Human Resources. Job descriptions, career paths, remuneration models, succession&ndash; does this stuff ring a bell? These items are all very important and good firms have them, <strong>  however great firms have something more important than HR tools. They understand the role of HUMAN CAPITAL. </strong> Successful business owners understand that the most difficult thing to create, and replicate is Human Capital. Anyone can copy a system, a service offering, or a product. It is almost impossible to replicate the chemistry, the culture, and the intent of a successful team. When we talk to firms we take a very close look at the staff and their relationships with each other. The &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; manual will tell you to look at tenure, experience and qualifications. These things are merely tickets to the game. A far more telling factor are the inter-relationships between office administration staff, para-planners, CSOs, planners and management. How shareholders interact, a lack of &lsquo;groupthink&rsquo;. The cumulative behaviours of all of the players create culture. We need as many observations of this as we can during the courting phase.</p><p> I was recently asked to pitch the AZNGA offering to a large firm that had been around for a while, but a firm I did not personally know. When I looked at the financials I had every reason to get excited. They were a large firm, reasonable growth, good profitability etc.</p><p> It took me about 25 minutes in their boardroom to establish that this firm&rsquo;s best years were behind it based purely on my observations of their &ldquo;Human Capital&rdquo;. I watched the senior principle try and grandstand by puffing out his chest and showing me and everyone else who was boss. I saw the younger planners attempt to mimic this behaviour, and most critically I saw a complete lack of alignment of interest between the shareholders. Here is a firm with strong financials based on past performance clearly headed for the left edge of the bell curve</p><p> <strong>  The next key element we look for is another cultural element. </strong> The most successful people in life are always open to learning from others, are open minded and listen. These people, in business, typically create what I call a culture of CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. The best place to look at to understand what I mean here is modern professional sporting teams. Here is an environment where players are monitored electronically &ndash; how many meters, tackles, calories, speed, endurance &ndash; it&rsquo;s all monitored, fed back in real time to players, benchmarked, and improved upon.</p><p> If you want to live at the right edge of the bell curve you need to be obsessed with measuring things, analysing the results, and making incremental improvements every single day. In early discussions with a firm we have now acquired we were talking about implementation of model portfolios. The key principal said &rdquo; y&rsquo;know it takes me 13 minutes per client to implement a manager change in our models. We have over 500 clients &ndash; that takes my team a month to execute&rdquo;. I was immediately impressed &ndash; yes there is a business problem to be solved &ndash; but here is a business leader who understood the problem because he was obsessed about measuring things and understanding the consequences. Do you reckon that adviser understands his business, and understands what good looks like and how to get there? you bet!</p><p> A culture of continuous improvement is normally accompanied by inclusiveness because you need to involve everybody to understand where the incremental innovation is going to come from. It&rsquo;s a real lead indicator for us. A great principle that I learnt earlier in my career is that large one-off innovations are rare. The best way to innovate is by making incremental improvements every day. In a number of roles I have had in my career I have implemented a &ldquo;one Improvement per team per week&rdquo; initiative resulting in hundreds of small innovations over a year. The result of each team implementing one simple cost-effective improvement every week is&hellip;.well transformational!</p><p> <strong>  Now let&rsquo;s focus on financials. </strong> It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that successful firms have P&amp;Ls that reflect good revenue growth, disciplined cost management, a focus on building ongoing revenue, and scale benefits. These things are all givens. To be honest there are two other financial statements that hold the real gold nuggets or in some cases poison chalices! They are the CASH FLOW statement and BALANCE SHEET! Cashflow is the lifeblood of small business. Fast growing businesses typically find it more difficult to get the cashflow right. They have a unique challenge of investing ahead of realisation of profit which creates a cash drag. We are currently assessing a firm who have ticked every box on our checklist, and in many ways are our ideal firm. We have put that deal on hold for a few months and set the firm a challenge of building up a certain cash reserve. This will tell us unequivocally whether or not they can manage cashflow.</p><p> However it&rsquo;s often the balance sheet where the magic lies. The balance sheet tells you about how a business has been managed over time. It also tells you about structure. One of the critical mistakes small businesses make when they set themselves up is that they are more focussed on tax optimisation than building long term value. It&rsquo;s all good and well to have partnerships of trusts, unit trusts, discretionary trusts, partnerships, and inter-company loans whilst you are operating year to year. However these types of structures can be very unattractive to buyers, increase legal and accounting costs, and often prevent a deal getting done. There are exceptions of course, however A SIMPLE STRUCTURE IS BEAUTIFUL!</p><p> <strong>  Now let&rsquo;s turn our attention to clients and client bases. </strong></p><p> In my experience the most successful firms have a clear view on who their ideal client is and are well geared up to service that client and equally prepared to refer clients who do not fit the model to others. It is vital that the FEE STRUCTURE KEEPS UP WITH THE TIMES, is reviewed regularly and implemented across the entire client base.</p><p> We also like to understand a firms approach to &ldquo;legacy clients&rdquo;. There are a number of strategies that can be employed to deal with clients that no longer fit the ideal client model that the firm now operates. At AZNGA we are fans of communicating the contemporary approach, along with the appropriate service offer and pricing and asking clients to sign up to this, be engaged in the planning process or seek alternatives.</p><p> On the compliance side of things we look at all of the usual things however there are two vitally important considerations.</p><p> <strong>  Firstly we have a good look at CLIENT COMPLAINTS. </strong> In my experience client complaints are a valuable lead indicator to future problems. I remember a situation where a complaints department had received around 7 very similar complaints regarding one adviser over about 6 months. The complaints department viewed them all as one-off.

However, with the arrival of the Internet and powerful search engines, this has all changed. Now, trying to be a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; offers much less competitive advantage in the overcrowded online market.</p><p> Many Advisors believe that by being a generalist, they are able to reach more people, which will lead to more potential clients. <strong>  The reality is, it is difficult to sell everything to everyone. </strong> If you cast too wide of a net online, you won&rsquo;t catch many fish at all. The challenge with a general audience is that your online messaging can become very generic and as a result, less persuasive.</p><p> So, you want to grow your business online, and gain a more effective online presence? Why is defining your niche market one of the first things you need to do?</p><h3> Niche Online Marketing = More effective marketing</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First off, what is niche marketing? </strong> According to  <a href=\"mailto:http://www.businessdictionary.com/\">  Business Dictionary </a> , &ldquo;niche marketing is concentrating marketing efforts on a small but specific and well defined segment of the population. Niches do not &lsquo;exist&rsquo; but are &lsquo;created&rsquo; by identifying needs, wants, and requirements that are being addressed poorly or not at all by other firms, and developing and delivering services to satisfy them. As a strategy, niche marketing is aimed at being a big fish in a small pond instead of being a small fish in a big pond.&rdquo;</p><p> The objective of Niche marketing is to become the expert and go-to for that service and audience, and develop a reputation as the preferred financial advisor for that market. Niche advisors become specialists with expertise in solving particular problems for a particular set of people with similar challenges. And because prospects see niche businesses as specialists, they are often more willing to pay a premium price for what they will perceive as being a higher level of expertise then generic Advisors.</p><h3> As a Financial Advisor, is it no longer safe to be a generalist in the digital age.  </h3><p> <br/> You only have a split second, if you&rsquo;re lucky, to catch a prospects eye when they are rifling through their Google search results. In a world where you are competing with thousands (millions even) of websites, the last thing you want to do is get buried because your content is generic. Ask yourself, with so many Advisors and content online, why should a prospect do business with you over another Advisor that they have come across online?</p><h3> Build your online presence around your niche market.</h3><p> <br/> These days, the only way to grab someone&rsquo;s attention is by providing him or her with something that is relevant and provides value. Instead of the risk of spreading yourself too thin by saying everybody is your potential client, niche marketing will help you to focus on a specific group of people, and what their specific needs and wants are. You&rsquo;ll quickly develop a deep understanding of what&rsquo;s important to them, the ins-and-outs of their financial affairs, their problems and opportunities. From there, you will know exactly what content to create and share with your digital network; crafting valuable content that is specifically targeted towards them and the challenges they are facing.</p><p> The best way to ensure that your website content is valuable is to make sure it fits the criteria of informative, interesting and relevant. If your content is informative, it will either answer a question often asked by your niche market, or provide valuable insights related to your niche market. If your content is interesting, it is written in a way that makes your niche market want to read it. If your content is relevant, then it relates to the lives, challenges, work, or interests of your niche market. In order for your niche site to stand out and rank higher than the others you&rsquo;re going to need great niche centered content that is both interesting and valuable to readers and potential customers</p><p> Targeting keywords and content that align with your target audience&rsquo;s search queries will also help in your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-search-engine-optimization-seo-and-why-do-i-need-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Search Engine Optimization  </a> </u>  efforts; helping you to rank higher in your specialized niche market.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 17:01:38.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 17:01:38.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_4Kkfxq4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-stand-out-from-the-crowd-of-financial-advisors-niche-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"6678\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 17:01:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 17:01:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-stand-out-from-the-crowd-of-financial-advisors-niche-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6677\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3071\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444465146604-4fe67bfac6e8-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"901\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444679100,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2984,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Family Business Transfers: The Most Hazardous Exit Path","link":"family-business-transfers-the-most-hazardous-exit-path","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In this article we discuss the indispensable requirement of successful transfers:  financial security for the owners/parents.  That requirement is too often threatened by a hazard common to this exit path:  transferring control to successors (in this case children) before the owners (parents) attain financial security.</p><p> All of us have watched parents transfer control, too soon, to children who subsequently prove incapable of, or unwilling to maintain the success of the business.  As children fail, the parents are helpless to intervene.  The business, the parents' financial security, and usually the hoped-for family legacy are destroyed.</p><h3> Parental Financial Security</h3><p> <br/> Unless an exit path leads to the owner's financial security, it isn't an exit path:  it is a cliff.  The definition of financial security and how it is achieved, however, depends, in large measure, upon an owner's unique situation. </p><p> Some owners are fortunate enough to enjoy financial security independent of the business.  Typically this occurs when, over years, an owner invests excess earnings outside of the business.</p><p> Some owners can reach financial security by leasing personally owned assets back to the business for its use.  These assets usually consist of equipment or office, warehouse or manufacturing facilities used in the business.  <strong>  Keeping ownership of these types of assets outside the business and its transfer: </strong></p><li> Provides ongoing, consistent income for the owner.</li><li> Lowers the value of the business and reduces transfer (gift or estate) taxes thereby easing the transfer of a business to a business-active child.</li><li> Makes assets (or wealth) available for transfer to non-business-active children (NBAC).</li><li> Protects assets from future creditors of the business after the parent exits. <br/>  </li><p> The difference between owners who look to leasing income and the owner whose financial independence does not rely on the business is that the first owner likely needs the business to continue to generate rental income.</p><p> Most owners, however, must achieve financial security through ongoing income from their businesses.  This is the major reason why a business owner should not consider--even for a moment--transferring control (operational or ownership) before achieving financial security.</p><p> <strong>  In the transfer of ownership to a child then, there are two competing issues: </strong></p><li> Owners must attain financial independence before they transfer ownership and control to their business-active children (or BAC).</li><li> The best tax-avoidance ownership-transfer strategies involve gifting, not selling, ownership to children.  This means, of course, that when owners transfer their controlling interest, they get nothing (or at least no cash!) in return. <br/>  </li><h3> Jumping the Gun</h3><p> <br/> If an owner tells you that she wishes to transfer her business to a child before she has attained financial independence, that announcement should raise a giant red flag.</p><p> Of course the owner trusts her child, but events outside the child's control can cause the child to lose control of the business or affect its cash flow, e.g. the child's premature death or (far, far more likely) divorce.  Also, children can make poor business and personal decisions that destroy business value and cash flow.</p><p> <strong>  To protect owners, yet give children the assurance that they will one day own the business, BEI Members take the following actions: </strong></p><li> Amend the parent's estate plan to provide for a transfer of ownership to the child at the parent's death;</li><li> Create a written Exit Plan describing the steps in which the child receives ownership as the parent attains financial security.  The plan design is based on the business attaining annual financial benchmarks, an approach we often use in insider transfers. <br/>  </li><p> If the BAC insists on controlling the business immediately, we recommend that the child obtain financing in order to pay cash for the parent's ownership interest--if that financing will provide the parent with financial security.  Of course this sale structure means the family does not avoid the double tax:  first on the parent's gain from the sale, and then on the child's income used to pay for the parent's ownership.</p><p> Also, banks are unlikely to lend money to successor owners unless they make a large down payment (20 to 40 percent of the purchase price), or (and this is a big \"or\") they already own a large percentage of the business--say 30 to 40 percent.  This means the buying children must receive significant ownership before acquiring the balance of the company for cash via bank financing.</p><p> Finally, if the business fails to perform as required, or the child leaves the business during the buy-out period, you must have the right to re-acquire the ownership already transferred.  This enables owners to execute their backup plan to transfer the business and obtain financial security via a sale to management or an outside party.</p><p> Whether an owner chooses a third-party sale, sale to management, or transfer to children, the owner/client's financial wellbeing must be achieved.  With family business transfers, the biggest risk to that financial wellbeing is transferring business control too soon.  A premature transfer of control is unnecessary and dangerous.  Instead consider using the design and techniques (some of which we've outlined in this article), to provide assurance to the children that they will own the company and to your clients that they will attain financial security.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 17:05:51.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 17:05:51.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_Weo2gv4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/family-business-transfers-the-most-hazardous-exit-path/\", \"post_id\": \"6680\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 17:05:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 17:05:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"family-business-transfers-the-most-hazardous-exit-path\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6679\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3072\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444360726299-f5e3b91192c7.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"764\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444658400,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2985,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"PR Lessons from the Presidential Campaign","link":"pr-lessons-from-the-presidential-campaign","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/public-relations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Riana Aldana  </a> </u> Leading evening cable newscasts and standing at the top of Twitter&rsquo;s trending topics are the names, pronouncements, shining moments and fumbles of the U.S. presidential hopefuls that are already in full campaign mode 14 months ahead of Election Day.  While there certainly is plenty of water cooler talk and Saturday Night Live fodder to glean from the campaign, the reality is that those in the trust business &ndash; like politicians &ndash; can learn something from the campaign.At the epicenter of the trust business are those people we entrust to handle our retirement savings and financial plans: our financial planners and investment advisors.  Truth be told, the average registered investment advisor (RIA) can learn a lot from studying the presidential campaign, and the triumphs and stumbles that occur along the way.</p><h3> 1. Always be fully equipped with a proper plan in place.</h3>Making moves without a plan is the perfect recipe for disaster. At this year&rsquo;s VMA&rsquo;s, Kanye West made a surprise declaration that came at the end of a long acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award. To wrap up his speech, Kanye stated &ldquo;As you probably could&rsquo;ve guessed by this moment, I have decided, in 2020, to run for president.&rdquo; While this is farther down the line, it certainly turned heads and got the rumor mill churning.Lesson: Advisors should plan for any financial turbulence that may come their way, rather than showing up unprepared or empty handed. Just last month, investors experienced rocky terrain as the stock market closed in negative territory. In the event of a market volatility, RIAs should have a set plan in place to quell any fears clients may have. The key is to gauge how any volatility may impact investments and to be direct in informing clients your stance and future market moves. It&rsquo;s essential to counsel your clients on best practices, whether that is through one-on-one meetings or a public forum.<h3> 2. Be mindful of your message and always manage your reputation.</h3>There&rsquo;s no argument that business mogul Donald Trump has taken the presidential campaign by storm. (The aforementioned SNL has already announced  they have dedicated a cast member to spoofing him for the fall season.) Over the last few weeks, his controversial viewpoints and comments have dominated media headlines and been a discussion point for many Americans.Lesson: Trump demonstrates that soundbites are memorable pieces of information. While he&rsquo;s straightforward and blunt, Trump is often criticized and remembered for his tendency to make inappropriate, garish remarks. RIAs should hone in on their messaging by taking ample time to avoid veering from their intended messaging in a media interview or appearance. In media interviews, any direct quote or soundbite is fair game for the reporter, so be sure to be direct with your messaging. You don&rsquo;t want to be construed in a negative or convoluted way, so be sure to speak clearly and directly in order to effectively build your credibility.<h3> 3. Abide by compliance rules and regulations.</h3>The Hillary Clinton email controversy arose in March 2015, and has been an adverse factor in her campaign ever since. Whether a regulation breach occurs on a national scale or a smaller one, the outcome has the potential to resonate with individuals (and clients) for some time.Lesson: When it comes to social media, the rules are ever-changing. RIAs with a PR plan in place must be well-informed of the compliance guidelines and rules that apply. Social media is an effective way for advisors to grow their business, leverage their referral network, enhance client relationships, and connect with peers. While advisors shouldn&rsquo;t shy away from social media because of compliance concerns, they should be fully aware of the firm&rsquo;s policies and follow them closely.As the public keeps a close eye on the campaign, you should follow suite &ndash; it may be more beneficial to your practice than you think.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 17:18:30.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 17:18:30.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_GA8ptoS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/pr-lessons-from-the-presidential-campaign/\", \"post_id\": \"6682\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 17:18:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 17:18:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"pr-lessons-from-the-presidential-campaign\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6681\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3073\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-11-at-10.24.44-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"358\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444672800,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

Old school tactics (some at least) still work &ndash; but only when updated for online. Here&rsquo;s how.The growth of the online space has changed the way financial services organisations connect and influence our customers. To stay relevant, we need to embrace online platforms. That means it&rsquo;s time to ditch the divide between offline and online and give action to an exciting new world of integrated online, print and social marketing and communication. Further to our blog  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/the-new-pr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The New PR: three ways to manage your PR online  </a> </u> , here are three ways to ensure you do just that.</p><h3> 1. Develop useful, relevant content</h3>Growing online accessibility and affordability means fewer consumers are buying their hard copy newspaper each day. News and other information can now be accessed from virtually anywhere whether it&rsquo;s online, via the 24-hour mainstream media cycle, social media or blogs. In this world that never sleeps, brands can make their mark by developing useful content that chimes with customer needs. In so doing, you can position your brand as a leader and, when the time comes, influence customer behaviour to your advantage. Remember: according to the <u> CMO Council</u>, 87% of buyers state that online content has a major or moderate impact on their selection of vendor or product.Having a clear content calendar is the first step in using content in this way (a.k.a content marketing).

McGill </strong></p><h3> Why Listen?</h3><p> <br/> Your employees have a huge impact on your day-to-day operations; what they have to say is important. The information that those on the front lines have to offer is extremely valuable. They are the ones with their fingers on the pulse of the organization. If you REALLY listen to what they have to say you might be able to head off problems early, learn something you don&rsquo;t know, and get some great ideas. When employees know that you care about their point of view and value what they have to say, you build strong relationships and improve your organizational culture.</p><h3> No &lsquo;us vs. them&rsquo;</h3><p> <br/> If you want to hear what your employees actually have to say, you must eliminate any &lsquo;us vs. them&rsquo; mentality in your organization. This mentality puts people in defensive mode. When we are on the defense, we are not even capable of higher order thinking let alone expressing ourselves in any meaningful way.</p><h3> Stop talking</h3><p> <br/> To actually hear what your employees are saying you must offer them multiple opportunities to communicate; a variety of settings and a variety of methods. Then, stop talking and listen. Show that you are attentive, ready and interested in what they have to say. When you aren&rsquo;t focused on what you want to say, it opens the space to hear what others are saying and to notice what they&rsquo;re not saying.</p><h3> Ask questions</h3><p> <br/> If you care about what your employees have to say, ask questions. Seems like common sense, but it doesn&rsquo;t happen as often as it should. Ask what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not. Is there anything we should stop doing? What do we need to start doing? Ask them for input and feedback. And, don&rsquo;t just ask work related questions; ask how they are doing. Let them know you care about them personally. Encourage them to ask you questions. Be honest with them. When you learn to ask the right questions you can get to the core of what your employees are actually saying.</p><h3> Acknowledge what you&rsquo;ve heard</h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest factors in hearing what your employees are actually saying is acknowledging what you&rsquo;ve heard. Verify that you understand what they are saying and demonstrate that you can see it from their perspective. Give them the opportunity to elaborate when necessary. Express appreciation for the information and feedback they provide.</p><h3> Watch their energy</h3><p> <br/> If you want to REALLY understand what your employees are saying, watch their energy. Their energy will send non-verbal information that helps you, as the listener, tap into what is really behind their words. Are they energetic and positive, showing passion? Are they subdued, showing lack of hope? Do they appear scattered, showing frustration or stress? The most productive conversations take place when you work together to build positive energy.</p><h3> What are They Actually Saying?</h3><p> <br/> Hearing what your employees are actually saying takes consistent effort. You can&rsquo;t just be open to listening once in a while, it must be constant. You must eliminate even the perception of an &lsquo;us vs. them&rsquo; mentality. You must stop talking. You need to ask the right questions. Acknowledge what you&rsquo;ve heard. You must watch their energy with as much attention as you listen. You must learn to hear what is not being said as much as what is being said. In most communication there is more substance behind the words than is contained in the words. Care enough to hear what your employees are actually saying.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 17:43:53.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 17:43:53.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_GIMVhb1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-to-hear-what-your-employees-are-actually-saying/\", \"post_id\": \"6686\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 17:43:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 17:43:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-to-hear-what-your-employees-are-actually-saying\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6685\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3075\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-11-at-10.38.17-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"404\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444662000,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2988,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Cover Letter Mistakes That Turn Off Any Hiring Manager","link":"cover-letter-mistakes-that-turn-off-any-hiring-manager","source_link":null,"content":"<p> If you&rsquo;ve been doing a job hunt for some time now, perhaps you have sent out several job applications via email already. But what if none of those you sent your resume and cover letter to has responded to your application? What could you be doing wrong that&rsquo;s making it almost impossible for you to receive a job offer?</p><p> <strong>  Here are possible mistakes in your cover letter that are silently sabotaging your chances of getting hired. </strong></p><h3> 1. You attach your cover letter to your email.</h3><p> You might be wondering it is a mistake to attach your cover letter to your email. How else could you send it anyway? Well, according to studies, most hiring managers go straight to applicants&rsquo; resume when both their resume and cover letter are attached to the same email. This means that they are not likely to open your cover letter and read it.</p><p> If you want to make sure your cover letter gets read, then it is recommended that you copy and paste it into the body of your email. This way, it has a better chance of being read because the receiver of the email doesn&rsquo;t have to open an attachment for the second time.</p><h3> 2. Your email contains almost your entire life story.</h3><p> When you include your cover letter in the body of your email, make sure to keep it short and to the point. There is no sense in going overboard with details. Hiring managers are not willing to spend a lot of time reading emails, so keep it short.</p><h3> 3. You provide information that&rsquo;s not relevant to the work you are applying for.</h3><p> There is nothing wrong with letting the recipient of your email know about your experience; in fact, it is necessary. But you can&rsquo;t keep talking about the jobs you have had in the past and the details of each job. Instead, talk about your experiences most relevant to what the employer needs. Your ultimate goal is to give the hiring manager a clear idea of what you can offer them in relation to what they are looking for.</p><h3> 4. You exclude data or information that has been specifically asked from you.</h3><p> Depending on what position is being filled, employers might require you to submit a sample of your work, your salary requirements, your hours of availability, and so on. Whatever is being asked of you to include in your email, be sure to have it. Otherwise, your application will end up not even being considered because you fail to follow instructions.</p><h3> 5. You do not use a cover letter at all.</h3><p> When you send an email to a hiring manager, your purpose is to sell yourself, which you cannot successfully do if you only include a short introduction about yourself. The purpose of your cover letter is to let hiring managers know who you are, what you can do, and why they should consider you for the position in their company. Your cover letter must also contain whatever it is the employer wants to know.</p><h3> 6. You use a boring closing statement.</h3><p> Avoid using a boring closing line. A good example of a more daring cover letter closing that can easily attract hiring managers is &ldquo;Call today, do not delay.&rdquo; This line shows how confident you are, and it is so unique that it could catch any hiring manager&rsquo;s attention. When you come up with a more interesting closing statement, you are putting yourself in a better position to be noticed by any hiring  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/what-is-mentoring/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  manager </a> .</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 17:49:14.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 17:49:14.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_Pno7wTO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/cover-letter-mistakes-that-turn-off-any-hiring-manager/\", \"post_id\": \"6688\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 17:49:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 17:49:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"cover-letter-mistakes-that-turn-off-any-hiring-manager\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6687\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3076\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444061608032-aa566ba2495a-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"720\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444677300,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}

One of the questions on we have is &ldquo;Do you know your effective federal income tax rate?\" I have yet to find anyone who actually knows this answer.</p><p> Most people just take their receipts and other tax related info to their tax preparer and hope for a refund. However, this approach does help plan to reduce taxes aka tax planning. Small business owners are in a unique situation to leverage your business owner status.</p><h3> <strong>  The drag of 401k plan fees and fiduciary </strong></h3><p> <br/> Amidst &ldquo;deflategate&rdquo; and Presidential primary news you may not have heard about the many high profile class action lawsuits asserting that plan overseers, the fiduciaries, did not properly watch over the fees being paid to their service providers. The latest one being Boeing. As many of the fees are typically hidden, this requires some investigative work or working with a third party to do the digging. I have heard from many conversations Fortune 1000 companies must have highly sophisticated employees that know all of the ins and outs of plan monitoring</p><p> As a small business owner you may feel behind the eight ball because you do not have the luxury of staff dedicated to plan oversight. However, you have a unique choice that larger firms may not have. You may decide to pay the plan fees directly. Working with your tax preparer, you may deduct the fees as a business expense. This makes the most sense when your individual account, is one of the largest individual accounts.</p><p> Let me explain. Let&rsquo;s say that you are paying fees of 2% for your plan. If you are like the majority of small business plans, those fees are being paid through the investments in the individual participant accounts. Let&rsquo;s assume plan assets of $1,000,000 and an individual account of $500,000. Multiplying your $500,000 by 2% means that you are paying $10,000 in to the pot that pays plan expenses. If your plan has 5 additional participants with a total balance of $500,000 your balance is subsidizing the plan cost for the others. Moreover, the 2% fee is dragging down your investment results. The SEC, General Accounting Office and Jeff Marzinsky of Millliman reported on the harmful effects of fees. Marzinsnky reported his findings in &ldquo;Hidden costs: Are 401(k) fees taking a bite out of retirement savings?&rdquo; He calculates &ldquo;Hidden fees are troublesome because, over a lifetime of contributing $5,000 a year, assuming an annual gross rate of return of 9%, a participant paying an additional fee of just 1% would retire with $1,918,678 rather than $2,448,895, or $530,217 less.

It now can be considered a business expense along with the other plan costs like administration and matching contributions. You have just given yourself an increase in your rate of return because you have decreased the fees.</p><p> You have gotten the 401k plan fees off of the radar of the Department of Labor Investigators that are concerned that your plan fees are not excessive and therefore harmful to your employees. Besides your return, you have given your employees a similar bump in their rate of return too.</p><p> However, this requires that you are working with an investment advisor that charges a fee vs. the more typical commission or share class world. Find out if your 401(k) financial advisor can charge you fees if they aren&rsquo;t already. If they can&rsquo;t you may have to evaluate if the benefits of working with them are worth the loss in investment performance and tax deductions. If they can, then get them together with your tax preparer and start enjoying the benefits. Once you make the switch, do an employee meeting to let them know the benefit of the change to them. Make sure they know why it is beneficial to work for you vs. a competitor that may not be a savvy as you.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-11-10 17:25:19.000000","last_updated":"2015-11-10 17:25:19.000000","image_url":"2015/11/article_placeholder_2973azD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/can-business-owners-cut-401k-plan-fees-and-save-on-taxes-too-2/\", \"post_id\": \"7357\", \"post_date\": \"2015-11-10 17:25:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-11-10 17:25:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"can-business-owners-cut-401k-plan-fees-and-save-on-taxes-too-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"7356\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3410\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-10-at-9.22.58-AM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"540\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1447257600,"author_id":207,"chart_url":""}

Whether it&rsquo;s the ballet barre, binging on babka, or bearing my soul before the Barolo arrives on a first date, I&rsquo;m an all or nothing type of girl. So it&rsquo;s no surprise that I&rsquo;m baffled by the frustratingly over-used term &ldquo;work-life balance.&rdquo; In a recent conversation with a group of women, a friend said, &ldquo;There simply isn&rsquo;t enough time for balance. Everything is important and everything is urgent.&rdquo;</p><h3> To this I replied, &ldquo;if everything is important and urgent, then nothing is important or urgent.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Self-help junkies (myself included) spend a good deal of time looking at whether their priorities align with what they truly want. One such person, Brian Dyson of Coca-Cola, was asked a question about balancing his needs and the needs of the world around him.</p><p> To this he responded, <strong>  &ldquo;Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling five balls in the air: work, family, health, friends, and spirit&hellip;Work is a rubber ball; if you drop it, it will bounce back&hellip;Family, health, friends, and spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> To this I respond:</p><p> Dear Mr. Dyson,</p><p> I am not a juggler. And balls do not only come in rubber or glass. Some are plastic, some are silver, and some are simply paper that&rsquo;s been crumpled into a ball-like shape before swiftly being tossed into the trash. <br/> So, sir, I have balls. Big ones. <br/> <br/> Many ones. Some, like my family, are made of silver and while they may get scratched and tarnish, are pretty freakin&rsquo; resilient. Others, like my hobbies, are made of whatever tennis balls are made of. They are brightly colored, make me happy, and sometimes get stuck in tall trees. I don&rsquo;t need to engage in a life of juggling. I&rsquo;ll take each ball off the shelf and return it safely to its proper place when I&rsquo;m done, trusting that it&rsquo;ll be there when I&rsquo;m ready for it again.</p><p> Yours truly,</p><p> Amita</p><p> Now, I could go on my soapbox and discuss the importance of prioritizing, but that&rsquo;s not what this post is about. It&rsquo;s about knowing that your priorities aren&rsquo;t set in stone. There are moments when work helps me to find meaning and contribute to the world, and there are times when focusing on my work is just plain wrong. Sometimes a glass ball turns into a rubber ball. And that&rsquo;s okay.</p><h3> So Here's the Takeaway:</h3><p> <br/> Work-life balance isn&rsquo;t about committing to your priorities for the rest of your life or even for the next 3 months. It isn&rsquo;t about maintaining a perfect ratio of kids: work: personal time. It isn't about over-thinking and over-stressing and over-asking yourself whether or not you feel balanced. It&rsquo;s about recognizing that everything ebbs and flows. And that a perfectly measured approach might make for a perfect babka, but not a perfect life.</p><p> So the next time a friend asks me about work-life balance, here&rsquo;s my response: <strong>  Do whatever feels right, know that it won&rsquo;t feel right for long, then adjust accordingly. </strong></p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 18:27:09.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 18:27:09.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_PqLEhEY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/balance-other-bs-stories-we-need-to-learn-to-forget/\", \"post_id\": \"6694\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 18:27:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 18:27:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"balance-other-bs-stories-we-need-to-learn-to-forget\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6693\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3079\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-11-at-11.30.37-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"479\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444650300,"author_id":22,"chart_url":""}

Weather forecasts were all over the place with different predictions and possibilities of the path the hurricane will take. Will it hit land or will it go out to sea? If it does hit land, where exactly will it come ashore? Who will be affected and what will the damage look like? For many of us, dealing with uncertainty is unsettling as we immediately remember the challenges we faced with previous hurricanes.</p><p> After we get over our initial  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/01/26/face-your-fears-straight-on/#sthash.lmHxIItY.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fears  </a> </u>  and concerns, many of us spring into action buying supplies for our homes (I still don&rsquo;t understand why everyone buys bread, eggs and milk) and readjust our plans. We begin to prepare for the unknown.</p><p> In the same way, leaders constantly face uncertainty in our jobs and careers. Team members leave at what seems the most inopportune time. New information is added into the mix to analyze. Deadlines are moved up. Another higher priority project hits our desk. Our personal lives need our attention. How will everything get done and how can we possibly lead with so many missing pieces and uncertainty?</p><p> <strong>  Leaders spring into action when uncertainty arrives. </strong></p><p> To overcome uncertainty and not let it get the best of us, leaders:</p><h3> Remain Calm and Breathe</h3><p> <br/> When a significant  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2013/04/23/an-unconventional-step-for-organization-change/#sthash.3kZvlnjt.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   change  </a> </u>  that we were not expecting knocks on our door, we need to stay clear minded. We can do this by stepping back and carefully evaluating what has happened. The worst thing we can do is panic or become paralyzed. De-stress by closing your eyes and taking 3 deep breaths.</p><h3> Stay Positive</h3><p> <br/> Whatever we do, we must see the glass half full when we are faced with ambiguity.</p><li> When we are positive we are less fearful.</li><li> When we are positive we can see opportunities.</li><li> When we are positive we can make better decisions.</li><li> When we are positive we can help others deal better with uncertainty. <br/>  </li><h3> Break Down the Necessary Steps </h3><p> <br/> In times of uncertainty a big picture may be too overwhelming to tackle.

Make a list of the individual steps and how you might approach resolving them. Be as specific as possible.</p><p> <strong>  Uncertainty can be tackled in smaller steps to make it manageable. </strong></p><h3> Prioritize</h3><p> <br/> Once we know the steps we want to take, we need to decide which to tackle first. When working with managers in crisis, they often will say, &ldquo;But all the steps are number one priority.&rdquo; They all might be important but we need to choose. This piece trips many of us up and we avoid action. Prioritizing is key.</p><h3> Call in the Troops</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s nothing more comforting during times of uncertainty than working alongside someone else who understands our concerns.</p><li> Set up a meeting with your team or colleagues to roll out the critical issues</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/04/26/are-leaders-getting-more-risk-adverse/#sthash.inAKv64N.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brainstorm  </a> </u>  as many resolutions as time permits</li><li> Draw on the strengths and talents of people who surround you</li><li> Keep everyone informed with up to date information <br/>  </li><h3> Swivel</h3><h3> <br/> During times of ambiguity we need to be flexible leaders, willing to make quick adjustments in a short timeframe. Working with a manager who lost several team members all at once, required the surviving teammates to take on unfamiliar responsibilities. It actually went so well because new skills and knowledge were learned and added to people&rsquo;s toolkits.</h3><h3> Avhieve Great Results</h3><p> <br/> The upshot of facing uncertainty is of course ending up with a strong outcome.

Japan. Iceland. Switzerland. Or any of the other places around the world that are notorious for being painful on the wallet.</p><h3> Venezuela is now the most expensive country in the world, hands down.</h3><p> <br/> To give you an idea, the cost of a 15-minute taxi ride to the beach yesterday afternoon totaled an eye-popping $158.</p><p> (I paid less than that to rent a helicopter in Colombia last week.)</p><p> With all of its vast mineral resources, Venezuela should be the most prosperous country in Latin America by far. And it once was.</p><p> But years of corruption, incompetence, and central planning have taken their toll.</p><p> Normally, when huge companies like Exxon Mobil extract oil out of the ground, they reinvest a portion of their profits back into improving their operations.</p><p> They spend money on more infrastructure, technology, and exploration. In short, they invest in the future.</p><p> But in Venezuela, guys like Hugo Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro spent years funneling oil revenues into idiotic social programs designed to keep themselves in power.</p><p> Venezuela did not invest in the future. Now its oil infrastructure is rotting. Production is in serial decline. And the oil price has collapsed to boot.</p><p> This is bad news for a government that generates a huge proportion of its revenue from oil exports.</p><p> And just like how the United States and most of the West can&rsquo;t balance their budgets without going even further into debt, Venezuela&rsquo;s government also spends far more than it generates in revenue.</p><p> Especially now. With the government&rsquo;s budget deficit at 14% of GDP, they&rsquo;re barely able to make their debt payments this month without defaulting.</p><p> In fact, Venezuela is so screwed up that the government doesn&rsquo;t have a hope of balancing its budget unless the oil price is between $100 and $120 per barrel.</p><p> Thus, they&rsquo;ve had to resort to even more destructive ways of making ends meet.</p><h3> Like most governments, that means printing money.</h3><p> <br/> The problem is: the Venezuelan bolivar isn&rsquo;t used as a reserve currency around the world like the US dollar or euro.</p><p> That is what has enabled the US to get away with its relentless printing so far, as much of the resulting inflation is simply exported abroad.</p><p> Instead, here when they print bolivars, Venezuelans are stuck with all of it. Zimbabwe style.</p><p> Inflation in Venezuela has been among the highest in the world, with some private estimates as high as 800%.</p><p> Once that became a problem, their solution was to introduce price controls, which failed miserably. Venezuela infamously tried fixing prices in the grocery stores and ended up with crippling shortages of everything from beef to toilet paper.</p><p> Then they decided to try capital controls by forcing a completely absurd &lsquo;official&rsquo; exchange rate to the local currency.</p><h3> And that&rsquo;s what makes this country so expensive.</h3><p> <br/> The official rate of the bolivar is 6.3 per US dollar. But the black market rate is over 60x higher.</p><p> Last night I met up with a local guy who had sacks of cash hidden all around his house, and I changed $50 for 20,000 bolivares. That&rsquo;s a rate of 400 per US dollar.</p><p> It&rsquo;s an unbelievable difference. 6.3 under the official rate. 400 in the black market.</p><p> My taxi ride yesterday really cost me 1,000 bolivares. Using the black market rate, that&rsquo;s a pittance at just $2.50. But using the official rate, it&rsquo;s $158.</p><p> So depending on which exchange rate you use, Venezuela can either be one of the cheapest countries in the world, or the most expensive.</p><p> But as you can imagine, exchanging currency in the black market carries SEVERE penalties.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s not all they&rsquo;re doing to prevent people from protecting themselves against a rapidly depreciating bolivar.</p><p> They&rsquo;ve even tried blocking access to Bitcoin-exchange websites to prevent people from purchasing crypto-currency.</p><p> (Though these efforts are easily defeated by using a VPN.)</p><p> Desperate to make ends meet in an environment where they see their savings and standards of living deteriorate by the day, many people have been driven to crime.</p><h3> Caracas used to be a paradise; now it&rsquo;s one of the most dangerous cities in the world.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a damn shame too, because this is a really wonderful country. And were it not for the crime, Venezuela would be a top retirement destination, attracting many an expat looking to live like royalty on $1,000 per month.</p><p> But that&rsquo;s not the case. Instead, Venezuela is sinking to rock bottom, and people here are suffering immeasurably.</p><p> All of this was brought on by yet another experiment in &lsquo;central planning for the greater good&rsquo; gone dreadfully wrong.</p><p> Too much spending created too much debt and too much money printing, which in turn created too much inflation.</p><p> Inflation then led to price controls. Capital controls. Media controls. Destroying people&rsquo;s standards of living. Appalling levels of violent crime.</p><p> They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Venezuela is a case in point, and shows just how short that road can actually be.</p><p> Westerners always think that these sorts of consequences can&rsquo;t happen where they live, as if the laws of the financial universe only apply south of the border.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not to say that the West will become Venezuela.</p><p> But if your government is already making its way down this path, taking on $60+ trillion in debt and printing limitless quantities of money, it&rsquo;s seriously foolish to assume that that it will not end up somewhere similar.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-11 19:01:13.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-11 19:01:13.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_qK2pLPi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/venezuela-is-now-the-most-expensive-country-in-the-world/\", \"post_id\": \"6698\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-11 19:01:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-11 19:01:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"venezuela-is-now-the-most-expensive-country-in-the-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6697\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3081\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-11-at-12.04.48-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1613\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444654800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

This can lead to an after-the-fact rationalization that the relationship ended due to factors entirely outside your control.</p><p> Here are eight reasons why you may lose a client, and steps you can take to correct each situation.</p><h3> 1. A reorganization or executive turnover</h3><p> <br/> Does this sound familiar? One of my clients told me: &ldquo;I spent several years developing a relationship with a vice president, and then he was squeezed out in a reorganization. The new head has a relationship with a key competitor of ours, and we&rsquo;ve heard he may bring them in.&rdquo;</p><p> Executive turnover is higher than ever. It&rsquo;s a fact of life. Get used to it. Here&rsquo;s how to make the best of these situations:</p><li> Build many-to-many relationships with all your key clients. If the relationship depends on one single executive, you are doubly exposed&mdash;the client could leave, and your own relationship manager could leave!</li><li> Make sure you are connected to a senior executive above your day-to-day client. That relationship will be worth its weight in gold when turmoil hits.</li><li> Ensure you&rsquo;re getting credit for your work and the value you&rsquo;ve added is appreciated broadly in the client organization.</li><li> Work hard to get the departing executive to vouch for you and introduce you to their replacement (of course, if you&rsquo;ve built a good relationship with them to begin with, this shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem!). <br/>  </li><h3> 2. A one-off or temporary need for your services.</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes, clients only have a periodic need for what you do. A college may hire a fundraising consultant only once every five or ten years, when they do a capital campaign. A corporation might only need the services of a construction company when they build a new headquarters building.</p><p> The first and most important thing you need to do is develop additional products and services that meet recurring needs. Ask yourself, &ldquo;What adjacent, ongoing needs can we help the client with?&rdquo; For example:</p><li> A fund raising consultant can help a university run their annual campaign more effectively</li><li> A construction company can help clients manage their facilities and do sustainability audits</li><li> An executive search firm can do talent planning, executive assessments, and leadership coaching in-between periodic searches. <br/>  </li><p> Second, you need to add value in-between major engagements. The client needs to perceive you as a trusted advisor in good times and lean times&mdash;when you&rsquo;re collecting fees and when there&rsquo;s a dry spell.</p><p> Are you calling on all your past clients each year, and adding value by sending them insightful pieces of thought leadership that addresses their most challenging issues?</p><p> Third, if your clients only rarely use what you offer, make sure you get referrals and testimonials from every single person you do business with. Your marketing strategy must be to spread a wide net, and those references will help you enormously.</p><h3> 3. A financial crisis or profit squeeze&mdash;and a lack of budget for you.</h3><p> <br/> A friend of mine provided coaching services to one of the Big Four accounting firms. This client grew and grew, and eventually accounted for 75% of his revenue. In 2008, when the financial crisis hit, the client did not renew his contract. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the budget for your coaching services anymore,&rdquo; they told him. A familiar tale?</p><p> It is a lie, however, that clients don&rsquo;t have the money to pay you. What they have decided is that using you is not a priority given their (invariably) limited financial resources.</p><p> The client who just told you they can&rsquo;t afford to keep going with you is paying for all kinds of things at this very moment&mdash;some of which may be either a complete waste or have a low ROI. They may be spending money on unproductive initiatives, poor-performing executives, excess office space, ineffective advertising, too many photocopiers, and so on.</p><p> They may also be spending more on your competition. How often have you heard there is a &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; on all management consultants, for example, only to discover that someone is still doing millions of dollars of work for the client? Note: That firm usually has very strong relationships with key senior executives&mdash;relationships which sustain them through the lean times.</p><p> Your challenge is demonstrate why your services should attract scarce budget. You do this by:</p><li> Showing exactly how you are part of the client&rsquo;s growth, profits, and innovation&mdash;not simply a cost, a necessary evil. You must compellingly draw a direct line between what you do and the client&rsquo;s highest-level goals</li><li> Relentlessly communicating the value and impact of your work.</li><li> Spending sufficient face-time with executives so that you have a good understanding of what is most important to them. <br/>  </li><p> Another client of mine was told that, due to spending cutbacks, every supplier in their market was being cut by 20%. He analyzed the client&rsquo;s total spend, and came up with a plan that would save them 30%&ndash;if the client consolidated all of their business with his firm. He won the deal, and dramatically grew his business with this client, even though the pie was shrinking!</p><h3> 4. The impact and benefits of your work are not compelling</h3><p> <br/> This reason often leads to the feeling that you aren&rsquo;t needed on an ongoing basis (reason 2) or unavailability of budget (reason 3). If you are delivering good quality, why would your client feel that what you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t relevant or compelling? Here are some possibilities:</p><li> You have not sufficiently communicated the value you&rsquo;re adding</li><li> You are working at too low a level in the organization and your product or service is basically hidden from view</li><li> You have not shown the client how you are helping them achieve their most important goals or priorities</li><li> Your work is acceptable but not perceived as &ldquo;a cut above.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re not wowing the client in any way.</li><li> The client perceives your products or services as solving a relatively insignificant problem. <br/>  </li><p> Your first step must be to diagnose why the client doesn&rsquo;t see you as a compelling and important provider. Then, you can take action. For example:</p><p> Can you do a better job of quantifying the benefits of your work?</p><p> Can you get some of the managers who know you and like you to vouch for you with senior management?</p><p> Can you make yourself useful in more meaningful ways to the client, either by evolving your service offering or raising your client service levels to &ldquo;knock their socks off&rdquo; levels?</p><p> Can you tie what you do&ndash;even if it impacts a small part of the client&rsquo;s business&ndash;to something larger and more important? For example: one of my clients is in the executive relocation business. Traditionally, it&rsquo;s a relatively small expenditure for corporations, and the job is given to a junior manager who is expected to get it done as cheaply as possible. My client redefined themselves as being in the business of enabling the mobile workforce, not just &ldquo;relocation.&rdquo; They started showing clients how what they do can be an important enabler of talent development across their clients&rsquo; organizations. This has created a unique differentiation within their industry and raised their relevance with clients.</p><h3> 5. Quality or delivery issues</h3><p> <br/> This is a bigger problem in some markets than others. The more moving parts there are to your solution, and the more technology is involved, the greater the chance of a quality failure.</p><p> Remember that &ldquo;quality&rdquo; is a function of three things:</p><p> <strong>  First, actual quality. </strong> Have you provided&mdash;by objective standards&mdash;a truly high-quality service or product?</p><p> <strong>  Second, expected quality. </strong> You can do a great job but have a very disappointed client if your solution does not meet their expectations, no matter how unreasonable you think they are.</p><p> <strong>  Third, perceived quality. </strong> Why do people think the relatively unappetizing Patagonian Toothfish (well, at least to my taste!) is wonderful? Because restaurants call it Chilean Sea Bass and dress it up with all sorts of fancy cooking methods, sauces, and side dishes.</p><p> To help bolster your client&rsquo;s verdict on the quality of your work, think about these strategies:</p><li> Put real, meaningful quality control mechanisms into place. These can include different levels of controls&mdash;for example, at the relationship manager level as well as at the senior management level. Ask your team members what they think. Get formal client feedback several times a year.</li><li> Carefully agree expectations at the beginning of a project or engagement. Focus on agreeing outcomes and objectives, not deliverables. A deliverable is a quarterly meeting, whereas an outcome is improved response times when customers call.</li><li> Enhance your client&rsquo;s perception of the quality and effectiveness of your work. One good way to do this is to create transparency around your process, so that your client sees all of your hard work and effort. A second way is to share the difficulty of what you&rsquo;re doing&mdash;in other words, make sure your client understands the challenges you&rsquo;ve overcome to deliver for them and the special requirements of the engagement. A third approach is to ensure your client gets positive feedback from their employees. This may not happen naturally. If someone tells you how helpful you or your firm have been, ask them (humbly) to share that comment with their boss. <br/>  </li><h3> 6. Poor personal chemistry</h3><p> <br/> Likeability is one of the four key qualities that nearly all client executives seek in a vendor or service provider (the other three are delivery, trust, and value). I&rsquo;ve heard this over and over again. One of my own clients, for example, fired a very smart and experienced consultant because he was arrogant and condescending with everyone below the c-suite.</p><p> If you work with a firm, you have the possible option of bringing in a new relationship manager or account executive when a lack of personal chemistry threatens the relationship. But why wait until that happens? You can enhance personal chemistry through some very simple steps. Sometimes, a relationship that starts off on the wrong foot can thrive when one side makes some sensible adjustments to their behavior. For example:</p><li> Are you being a good listener? Do you listen carefully, affirm, and ask thoughtful follow-up questions?</li><li> Have you shown your immediate, work-with client that you can be trusted to support them and their goals&mdash;as opposed to politicking and going behind their back to their boss?</li><li> Have you taken the time to understand how your client would like to structure and manage the relationship and how they like to communicate?</li><p>  </p><h3> 7. A decline in trust</h3><p> <br/> To understand how this can happen, let&rsquo;s first reexamine what builds trust with clients. Very simply, professional trust is based on:</p><li> <strong>  Competence:  </strong> You have to consistently deliver against expectations</li><li> <strong>  Integrity:  </strong> You have to demonstrate honesty but also reliability, consistency, and discretion.</li><li> <strong>  Perception of intent, or agenda focus: </strong> You have to show you are deeply concerned about your client&rsquo;s agenda, not yours&mdash;that you&rsquo;re looking out for their interests at all times.</li><p> <br/> Several other factors influence a client&rsquo;s willingness to trust. These include their perception of the risk of trusting you, and the amount of face time they&rsquo;ve had with you. You rarely trust someone you haven&rsquo;t spent time with!</p><p> Usually, I think a decline in trust is precipitated by a feeling that you no longer care as much as you used to and the work you&rsquo;re doing is not as sharp as it was.</p><p> Part of the solution to this is to schedule a regular &ldquo;agenda setting&rdquo; conversation that is focused on the client&rsquo;s overall business and on how the relationship is doing rather than a project update.</p><h3> 8. Complacency</h3><p> <br/> This is probably the reason many relationships end&mdash;professional and personal. One side takes the other for granted. Or, both simply stop caring the way they did at the beginning of the relationship.</p><p> At a broader level, complacency is the enemy of the successful professional. You enjoy your work, you have good clients, and you make good money. So why try harder? It happens all the time. You stop pushing, and you start&mdash;well, coasting. When that happens it&rsquo;s time to shake yourself up.</p><p> Each year, look at your client list. Ask yourself these questions:</p><li> Which clients keep you up at night, and which ones get you up in the morning because you&rsquo;re excited about the work?</li><li> Which clients are at risk of leaving you for some of the eight reasons outlined in this article?</li><li> Do you have a valuable client towards whom you are getting complacent? Why is that happening?</li><li> What would a competitor do to go after your clients and take some of their business away from you?</li><li> This year, are you taking your practice to the next level&mdash;or at least, markedly improving it in several respects? What&rsquo;s your plan to do that? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  In conclusion: Be intentional about holding on to those client relationships that provide strong mutual benefit and which are engaging and motivating for you. </strong></p><p> Keep in mind these eight reasons why clients can leave. Sometimes it&rsquo;s inevitable that a relationship ends, but there&rsquo;s a lot you can do to counter each of these challenges:</p><p> 1. A reorganization or executive turnover <br/> 2. A one-off or temporary need for your services. <br/> 3. A financial crisis or profit squeeze&mdash;and a lack of budget for you. <br/> 4. The impact and benefits of your work is not compelling <br/> 5. Quality or delivery issues <br/> 6. Poor personal chemistry <br/> 7. A decline in trust <br/> 8.

This doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t be able to get coverage, but it does mean their options will be limited.</p><p> As people age we all may face certain health challenges. If you want to help your clients figure out what options they have, then you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.</p><p> Most individuals with pre-existing conditions give up trying to buy life insurance because of three reasons. They can&rsquo;t find facts about the underwriting guidelines to see if they may qualify; if they can qualify, it&rsquo;s difficult to figure out the cost of coverage; and they struggle to find an agent who can explain the options available to them.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve help customers solve all three of those challenges, and you can too.  More importantly, as agents, we can all help them buy life insurance, even if they have a per-existing medical condition.</p><h3> Where Can They Find the Underwriting Facts</h3><p> <br/> We all know that individuals must qualify to buy life insurance.  Every insurance company classifies pre-existing conditions in a different manner.  For example: An underwriter will approach a diagnosis of cancer completely differently than an applicant who has diabetes. A pre-existing medical condition does not mean every life insurance company will automatically decline to issue someone coverage.</p><p> If nothing else, customers should have the facts &ndash; and I want to demystify this material &ndash; so you can give them a clear explanation about how this process works. Think of this chance as a way to help free your clients from confusion, rumors and myths associated with getting life insurance.</p><h3> What Clients Need From Us</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  A confession: </strong> One of the things that upsets me the most &ndash; the single thing I work my best to prevent &ndash; is the mistaken belief among a lot of people that they are somehow not good enough, not worthy enough or just plain not eligible to get life insurance.</p><p> What you need to be is an agent who is not scared to take a chance, and to invest the time and effort on your client&rsquo;s behalf.  You need to be someone who will contact underwriters and multiple companies, an agent who knows how to submit a trial application, and a well-written cover letter.  That is what we do.  We go the extra mile for customers with pre-existing conditions because we know how important getting life insurance is, and you should too. That is why it is wrong that so many citizens, to whom we owe so much, hear so little about the truth about getting life insurance.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 15:26:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 15:26:56.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_clBVsDd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/helping-clients-with-pre-existing-conditions/\", \"post_id\": \"6702\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 15:26:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 15:26:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"helping-clients-with-pre-existing-conditions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6701\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3083\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-12-at-8.33.29-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"566\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444744800,"author_id":71,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2996,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Email Missteps Every Online Marketer MUST Know","link":"5-email-missteps-every-online-marketer-must-know","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DataDynamix1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kevin Layton  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://data-dynamix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Data-Dynamix  </u> </a></p><p> Email is by far one of the best digital marketing solutions to have in your toolbox.  However, with this approach there is plenty of room for error amid an industry rife with regulations; delivery, filtering and other technology concerns and a glut of ever-evolving best practices. While email marketing is definitely not rocket science, there IS a certain degree of skill and artistry involved in crafting a winning email campaign. <strong>  Proceed with abandon and it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll end up wasting time and money on failed email campaigns.  </strong> <br/> <br/> Email campaign failure can happen for a multitude of reasons, and the 5 missteps listed below are among the most common and easily avoidable offenses that every online marketer should take proactive measures to avoid. </p><h3> 1. Boring the Audience</h3><p> There are a ton of ways online marketers can bore their audience, from lackluster subject lines to verbiage-laden text only emails, to emails that only talk about the company and provide nothing of tangible or even perceived value&mdash;the all-important &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it for me&rdquo; factor.  While email can feel one-sided, it is really intended to be a conversation&mdash;the start of one. Savvy marketers understand this.  For a better success rate, provide an enticing offer and certainly an eye-catching subject line to encourage positive open rates.  Design colorful and well-branded graphics to appeal to our world&rsquo;s love of visual content.  Provide valuable resources, articles, offers and calls to action that truly give something to your email audience.   Ultimately, think about how you can provide value to those on your email list.</p><h3> 2. Annoying the Audience </h3><p> You know the feeling when you get interrupted by a little fly buzzing around your head, and then again 30 seconds later, and then yet again 30 seconds after that?  Don&rsquo;t be the little fly pestering people too frequently.  Of course, finding the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; for the timing tolerance of each audience takes a little experimenting, observation and an understanding of the industry in which they operate.  Your audience will love hearing from you if you are providing value in a way that gives them room to breathe&mdash;to consider your office and how it fits into their own needs and objectives. Understanding the &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; of an industry and the standards by which they operate is a great starting point to determine a suitable frequency and timing of emails.  When you find the sweet spot, you&rsquo;ll know it and your audience will respond to your campaigns in kind.</p><h3> 3. Confusing the Audience </h3><p> All too often online marketers try to cram too many messages into one email, trying to accomplish or convey too many things at once.  There should always be one clear call to action and any messaging or imagery, and links should always direct the customer to a landing page where they can act upon that main call to action.  When an email campaign vehicle is cluttered with multiple messages&mdash;to purchase one thing, call for a free consultation, follow the brand and more&mdash;the recipient can be distracted from the main reason for the email.  Stick to one primary message around which all else is focused and be sure to tell your potential customer what you want them to do next. Don&rsquo;t cause them to wander aimlessly around your website or landing page.</p><h3> 4. Bombarding the Audience   </h3><p> Marketers get excited when they&rsquo;re embarking upon an email marketing campaign. It&rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road. . As touched on above, they often try to throw everything they've got at their audience in the form of too much written copy and too many design features such as star bursts or complicated shapes.  While you can include all of these bells and whistles from a technical standpoint, it&rsquo;s simply not necessary or even beneficial to do so.  The best email campaigns are those that keep the design interface and messaging simple.  That means clearly written and formatted content as well as clean, fresh graphics and design. Keep in mind that even the best email marketing vehicle won&rsquo;t convey your message as effectively as a well-conceived and executed website. This is why the email campaign should compel the recipient to head in that direction and facilitate in an intuitive, efficient and streamlined fashion.</p><h3> 5. Missing the Audience</h3><p> At a high level Email marketing seems simple enough but, when you dig into all of your options with data filters in particular to specifically target certain audiences, it becomes clear just how complex the endeavor really is.  Today, online marketers have countless list segmentation options but, sadly, they often choose poorly when it comes to filtering their email list.  There are many mission-critical segmentation options to consider like geographic, socioeconomic and demographic filters that allow the user to refine a list.  For example, a localized Mercedes dealership would target potential customers who live within a certain zip or area code radius of their location, have certain interests and make enough in salary to afford a high end vehicle. In this way, online marketers can use list segmentation filters to target an audience with a high likelihood of being receptive to your message.  </p><p> While nothing in the advertising and marketing realm with notable upside comes without risk and there are definitely ways to waste money and ruin opportunities with email marketing, there are even more ways to increase site traffic, lead generation and revenue among other goals.  The key is to invest the time up front to design an effective email campaign, which starts by heeding the blunders detailed above     .  For extra assurance, digital marketers often enlist the help of field experts and outside voices who can consult on the preparation process and catch errors that may have otherwise been missed.  When executed properly, email marketing can grow a business in a very strategic and calculated manner, not just delivering a good return on investment for a single campaign but also ultimately growing your business over the long-term.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 15:53:29.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 15:53:29.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_Dvf3oHT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-email-missteps-every-online-marketer-must-know/\", \"post_id\": \"6704\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 15:53:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 15:53:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-email-missteps-every-online-marketer-must-know\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6703\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3084\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-12-at-8.56.00-AM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"597\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444763700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":2997,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Successful College Football Recruiting is the Same as Successful Sales","link":"successful-college-football-recruiting-is-the-same-as-successful-sales","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HireVueSales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bobby Deren  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://accelerate.hirevue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Hire-Vue  </u> </a></p><p> The best salespeople are the ones who deliver a pitch and have their prospect buy in. Sales extends to a wide variety of areas, from retail to pharmaceuticals and even to college football. The best college football teams are successful because coaches are able to sell their programs to players with  <a href=\"http://accelerate.hirevue.com/offer/grant-cardone-social-selling-summit-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  sales pitches </a>  that project a bright and prosperous future.</p><h3> Relationships</h3><p> <br/> Before Alabama or Ohio State won a national championship, each program succeeded in the relationship aspect of the game. Successful recruiting is all about building solid relationships. Some of those relationships start when prospects are as young as high school freshmen, even eighth-graders in some cases. How those relationships are cultivated over time determine how good of a recruiting class a college football team produces. </p><p> That explains why there is no end to the recruiting season, which is one reason many coaches prefer the NFL as opposed to the college ranks. National champion Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer stepped out of the coaching for a year because of the demand the job entailed. However, he returned and proved last year that his ability to build relationships in recruiting is the recipe for a national title. </p><p> Relationships in the sales game are equally as important. Instead of always talking sales to prospects, try talking about life. Find out a prospect's interests, likes and dislikes. College coaches get to know recruits on a personal level and there is no reason salespeople shouldn't do the same. By doing so, the player is not just a running back, he becomes a person.</p><p> The same approach enables a prospect to become an individual and not just a number or a sale. By building a relationship, salespeople can actually cater to the individual needs of each client. That means always having an open ear or spare time to talk to a prospect and always maintaining that same open line of communication when the prospect becomes a client. </p><h3> Technology</h3><p> <br/> In the old days, college football coaches would have to rely mostly on one-on-one meetings in order to sell their program to recruits. Now, coaches have different ways to communicate. There are certain periods during the year known as the quiet period and the dead period, both of which restrict coaches from visiting players and limiting their contact. However, Twitter has become a coach's best friend. Coaches are still allowed to direct message recruits, which maintains open lines of communication.</p><p> Sales associates can also use technology to their advantage. When they cannot be in front of their clients, reaching out via social media is an excellent tool. Portable technology has tremendous advantages, but just as one tool cannot build a house, one piece of technology will not close a sale. Combining social media, face time, power point, CRM technology and other helpful apps should all be essential tools used by every salesperson.</p><h3> Tricks of the Trade</h3><p> <br/> The recruiting process can be a long one and that can also hold true in the sales process. There are lessons every salesperson can take from college football coaches in order to make optimal use of their time. Some college coaches send out cards to the mothers of recruits on occasions like birthdays and Mother's Day. Now, it may not be a smart move to track down the mother of a prospect. However, it won't hurt to send prospects well wishes on birthdays or during the holidays.</p><p> Some coaches have gone as far to strategically advertise their program on billboards neighborhoods of high-profile recruits. It is a way to capture their attention. It is also a method that can be used by sales reps when trying to close on a prospect. </p><p> Sales reps do not need to rent billboards, but they do need to find a way to hold the attention of their prospects. One way to do that is to get their objections and fears out in the open so that sales reps can begin demonstrating value and providing solutions. This type of approach will go a lot further than simply citing statistics, specifications or just regurgitating boring old facts and figures. </p><h3> Finding Talent</h3><p> <br/> The goal of every college football coach is to find talent. That happens by watching endless hours of game film, hosting football camps for recruits, and attending high school games. The entire coaching staff takes to the road at various times of the year to evaluate players in person to determine which ones will be the best fit for their respective programs. That is what makes coaching college football a year-round job. When coaches are not on the field coaching, they are busy with recruiting.</p><p> Developing leads is essentially the same task and is also never-ending. Sales reps also have a variety of ways to attract leads. One way is to produce informative and consistent content, whether that be via social media, a website, newsletter, or blog. This method will establish credibility, which will actually attract leads.</p><p> Another way to acquire leads is through cross-promotion. Alliances with other companies, individuals and services could have a fair share of benefits. Serving as a guest speaker, guest blogger or volunteer is another way of spreading the word about your service and pulling in new leads. </p><p> Successful seasons on the college football field are very much like successful sales seasons. They all start by working diligently towards the future, long before that distant season ever begins.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 16:27:55.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 16:27:55.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_1kZc65C.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/successful-college-football-recruiting-is-the-same-as-successful-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"6706\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 16:27:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 16:27:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"successful-college-football-recruiting-is-the-same-as-successful-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6705\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3085\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-12-at-9.29.09-AM-2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"528\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444737600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":2999,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Profit or Exponential Growth: You Usually Can't Have Both","link":"profit-or-exponential-growth-you-usually-cant-have-both","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Traditional methods of planning and forecasting new businesses are dramatically changing in nature and diversity.   On one hand, traditional small businesses need to show profitability, at some point, so they can pay their bills and find investors.  On the other, many new businesses like apps, sharing sites and new technologies require large scale, large investments, exponential growth and losses over several years to prove their concept.  In addition, forecasts of these larger entities are generally meaningless because of the risk and uncertainty.  VC firms are also looking for potential 100 million-plus entities while the small entrepreneur is frequently pleased with a million dollar entity that makes 10 % profit. </p><p> While goals, business, and energy account for much of the differences the characteristics of the entrepreneur and investor have a great impact. Some are just out of college, living at home, with a sort of unrealistic view of life.   Others are venture capitalists (VC), like a shark tank judge, looking for the next billion dollar deal.  Some are in their 30&rsquo;s or 40&rsquo;s with extensive expertise and experience, but with a need to make a living quickly. No matter what the background is, you still need to consider the goals, risk, competition, market size and growth, resources, experience, expertise, in developing a strategy.  </p><p> <strong>  We also need to focus more on the realities of different startups.  Consider this: </strong></p><li> The Kaufmann Foundation, a group that promotes business growth, estimates there are about 400,000 new startups every year and that 90% of them will fail before their fifth year.  </li><li> There are also an estimated 131 startup companies in the last few years that have achieved over $ 1 billion of valuation led by Uber at 51 billion.  <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Thus, in about 5 years, the odds are that about 1 in 15,000 (2,000,000/130) that the company will reach $ 1 billion in valuation, and 1 in 10 (mostly small companies) that they will survive five years. </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are also significant variations in these outcomes. For example, small companies get bought or sold and many large companies succeed but have less than $ 1 billion valuations. </p><p> The key reality is that most of the billion dollar companies achieved exponential growth but also lost money over several years.  For example, Uber is presumed to lose about $ 200 million annually.  Similarly, virtually every new large startup shows dramatic increases in sales, but even more dramatic increases in losses.  Even Amazon lost $ 241 million dollars last year but has a stock value over $ 400 billion.   </p><p> <strong>  There are some obvious recommendations for this dilemma: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Understand your goals, resources and risk. </strong>  In particular really understand your market analysis, competition, and how and why your company is different, and why customers should care.</li><li> <strong>  For small business owners, proper planning, adequate research, business excellence </strong> , well executed programs, and ensuring PROFIT are critical to being in the 10% that SUCCEED!</li><li> <strong>  If you require exponential growth to ultimately succeed, you still need to understand metrics. </strong>  No matter the size of your business, understand the risk and uncertainty, develop the resources or at least plans, assess the ultimate market and ensure there is at least a potentially profitable metric down the road. <br/>  </li><p> In summary I have learned that traditional startup recommendations like planning, budgeting and expertise are not as important in startup businesses that require great scale, risk and uncertainty. In addition the incredible potential of these efforts may warrant the risk. However, they can still develop metrics and professional methods to accelerate the growth and mitigate the losses.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 18:18:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 18:18:58.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_9koFsnE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/profit-or-exponential-growth-you-usually-cant-have-both/\", \"post_id\": \"6710\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 18:18:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 18:18:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"profit-or-exponential-growth-you-usually-cant-have-both\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6709\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3087\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444570678781-8465e21a195b-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"574\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444739400,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s amazing the impact that one person can have. It&rsquo;s easy to forget how powerful we all are. <strong>  Single-handedly, we can inspire everyone around us, or take an entire team down in flames, I&rsquo;ve witnessed both ends of the spectrum. </strong></p><p> When I first met the &ldquo;down-in-flames&rdquo; leader, she didn&rsquo;t make eye contact with me, her self-consciousness peeking out from behind her I&rsquo;m-suppose-to-be-tough-exterior. With her team, she was critical and condescending. When people brought her their ideas she shut them down right away without consideration. She didn&rsquo;t listen. She didn&rsquo;t ask questions. Recognition and appreciation were unheard of. Every person on her team believed to their very soul that she didn&rsquo;t care, that she was somehow born without a heart, and that her primary goal in life was to make them miserable. I knew this to be untrue, but then again it&rsquo;s much easier to be understanding and compassionate toward someone when you lived in a different state and didn&rsquo;t have a reporting relationship! Senior leaders, for years, had made attempts to coach down-in-flames, to no avail. Team members threatened to leave regularly, but didn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;d stay, she&rsquo;d stay, and nothing changed. It was an openly hostile environment. Productivity?  You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding. Engagement?  Ha!  Imagine the cost!

It&rsquo;s not biology &ndash; &ldquo;Down-in-flames&rdquo;, despite what her team thought, wasn&rsquo;t born with some evil gene, while other leaders got all the nice ones. I believe that there are three things that differentiate the great leaders from the not-so-great leaders:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Great leaders &ldquo;check themselves first&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> They are always examining their own thoughts and behaviors and looking for what they can do better. They are disciplined in their thinking and understand that how they think influences how they act. They keep the messages they send themselves positive, and the messages they let in from others (about who they are and what they&rsquo;re capable of doing) filtered.

Some will monitor questions or comments that come in on those posts and some do not.  </p><p> A marketing agency, (and some immediately think of the old advertising agency model, like Mad Men) might be focused on print or television media as well as coming up with campaign ideas and then outsource the daily social media activities.  </p><p> <strong>  If you are like most organizations, you might need a bit of each. </strong>  You want someone to help you come up with creative ways to reach your ideal customers, write or produce the content that appeals to these customers and follow this all the way through from content to results.  After all, it&rsquo;s about getting more people to become aware of your and your brand and then to encourage more to consider hiring you or buying your products or services.  </p><p> It&rsquo;s important to ask lots of questions when looking to hire someone to help you with your marketing.  Some think if they hire a marketing or social media company, customers will walk in the door to make a purchase the next day.  While this certainly can happen.  It&rsquo;s like saying you heard a commercial or saw an article in a magazine today and immediately went out to buy the item advertised.  While that happens, especially if you are really hungry and you see an ad or commercial for a big juicy burger or VooDoo donuts, the reality is, most of us are not running burger or donut shops.  </p><h3> Marketing is about making a connection with people.  </h3><p> <br/> A connection via content that can be written, recorded on video or audio, or even through a simple photo that disappears in 10 seconds  <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (SnapChat) </a> . After this initial connection is made, a relationship is hopefully started and through more exposure to your content, this relationship is nurtured and you continue to provide value and information until the person feels that you are the answer they have been searching for.  This could take hours, days or years, depending, typically, on your sales cycle, the price point of your product or service and when each person actually has a need.</p><p> The more targeted your content is (meaning, you shouldn&rsquo;t be posting your content on LinkedIn if you are trying to reach teens, and you probably don&rsquo;t want to be running ads for a high end luxury car during  <a href=\"http://www.judgejudy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Judge Judy </a> ), the quicker the return will be on your investment.      </p><p> Many marketing agencies have had to adapt and begin using the new tools of the day with social media, and many early social media management companies are having to step back and make sure they are incorporating a more holistic marketing approach that goes beyond a few posts on Facebook.  Take some time to figure out what you need to grow your business and then make sure you are hiring a person, or company that can partner with you to make that happen. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 19:39:16.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 19:39:16.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_pTIqzrV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whats-the-difference-between-a-marketing-agency-and-a-social-media-company/\", \"post_id\": \"6714\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 19:39:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 19:39:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whats-the-difference-between-a-marketing-agency-and-a-social-media-company\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6713\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3089\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-12-at-12.41.28-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"509\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444752000,"author_id":185,"chart_url":""}

I am a huge fan of Allen's, and over the last few years I have worked hard to incorporate his principles into my daily routine. </p><p> A common complaint I hear relates to information overload. There is just too much we have to process every day. <strong>  Technology can put information overload on steroids. </strong> But it is not the information, it is how we handle it. As David Allen is fond of saying, if the sheer quantity of information were the problem then every time we walked into the library our heads would explode.</p><p> Technology is not the cause of our struggle to get the right things done but used poorly it can make the problem a lot worse. Allen's principles can help us do more than get organized (hugely valuable in itself), but can help us tame the technological beast and put it in our service. He suggests a series of five steps to optimize your focus and resources:</p><li> Capture everything that has your attention, at work and at home, and writing. The first time you do this may take as much as six hours to \"empty your head.\" A big project to be sure but a necessary one if the rest of the system is going to work.</li><li> Clarify what each priority means to you. Decide what results you want, and what actions are required.</li><li> Keep an inventory of all your projects someplace where you will see them often, and organize reminders for the to-do lists you create.</li><li> Regularly review your inventory of commitments and projects.</li><li> Deploy your attention and resources appropriately. <br/>  </li><p> As I gradually learn how to utilize technology to apply Allen's principles, I find myself more consistently completing the important tasks I have committed to. I find that the more diligent I am about having discipline in following his ideas, the more productive I am and the more technology helps me accomplish things rather than burying me deeper in a tidal wave of tasks and information. If you struggle with overload of any kind, I strongly encourage you to take a look at some of the articles on Allen's  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.davidco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   website  </a> </u>  or to get his book  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335285987&amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Getting Things Done  </u>  . </a>  His ideas have been a career changer for me.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 19:43:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 19:43:56.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_GKE5C78.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/technology-wont-organize-us-it-creates-a-greater-need-to-be-organized/\", \"post_id\": \"6716\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 19:43:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 19:43:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"technology-wont-organize-us-it-creates-a-greater-need-to-be-organized\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6715\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3090\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/madebyvadim-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"532\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444735800,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}

But your planning shouldn&rsquo;t end there.Your vision needs to be matched with your priorities.For many financial advisors, this is another area of business planning that can be easily overlooked.  When the markets are bouncing around and business seems tough, everything can become a priority.  There is a tendency tinker and not simply focus on those aspects of your business that will have the greatest impact on your results.When the markets are on an upswing and things are going well, there&rsquo;s a penchant to leave &ldquo;well enough&rdquo; alone.  Priorities can be set aside or even forgotten.Steven Covey says, &ldquo;To live a more balanced existence, you have to recognize that not doing everything that comes along is okay.  There&rsquo;s no need to overextend yourself.  All it takes is realizing that it&rsquo;s all right to say no when necessary and then focus on your highest priorities.&rdquo; I see this tendency with many financial advisors when we begin a coaching engagement.  As we initially go through a process for establishing priorities, they create excruciatingly long lists.  They don&rsquo;t want to miss anything.But when we stop to take the time to discuss each item, the true priorities become apparent.Quite often there are only two or three strategies that will have a significant impact on their near-term performance.  So we put these priorities in order and they go to work.  They put first things first.  Results quickly follow.And new priorities become apparent.Establishing priorities reminds of a quote I once heard attributed to Bill Gates:  &ldquo;Only through focus can you do world-class things, no matter how capable you are.&rdquo;  By focusing on priorities, you are:</p><li> Eliminating distractions &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</li><li> Giving yourself a chance to make meaningful change &ndash; changes that last.</li><li> Allowing yourself to finish what you start &ndash; not keeping a zillion balls in the air.</li><li> Doing something as well as it can possibly be done &ndash; truly striving for excellence.</li>So, with your <u> <a href=\"http://encorepartners.com/do-you-picture-yourself-succeeding/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mental picture of success </a></u> firmly in place, decide on your priorities.

There is no hope without the salvation politicians are selling. The half-truths and outright misrepresentations are astounding enough to make you grab the shovel and start digging your bunker.</p><p> Instead, let&rsquo;s reframe some of the rhetoric and silliness, especially when it comes to the economy.</p><p> When you hear a politician place the credit for economic expansion at the feet of the current administration, you can reach for the airsick bag or bowl of popcorn. It&rsquo;s all theater. Yes, it is true that Fed policy impacts the economy. Yes, it is true that certain tax provisions can stimulate the economy. But let&rsquo;s face it&mdash;it takes years from the action to the intended result.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take, for example, Fed easing or tightening of monetary policy&mdash;the cost of lending from bank to bank. The markets erupt in anticipation of an action and by the time the actual announcement is made, the markets have already priced in the change. But the real impact might take several quarters or years to achieve.</p><p> Another example. During the Recession (you remember the Recession, right?) the government decided to stimulate the economy by sponsoring massive spending on infrastructure. Many voters thought &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s awesome&rdquo;. Except the time from legislation to the first shovel in the ground could be three to five years. So where&rsquo;s the stimulus?</p><h3> There is action. There is talk. And there is fear.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better not invest money because the market might crash!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better not spend the money on that class to improve my skills, because I might lose my job when the economy collapses.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust financial institutions, so I&rsquo;m going into mattress mode.&rdquo;</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s looks at some facts.</h3><p> <br/> The economy, for the most part, has little to do with Congress or the President. The success or failure of the economy is mostly a function of market cycles or growth, expansion and contraction. It&rsquo;s like spring following winter. Eventually, it does.</p><p> Company earnings and profits are the bell-weather of where we are in the cycle and all the fear in the world isn&rsquo;t going to change that.

{"original_id":3005,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Donald Trump Revises His Position on Social Security","link":"donald-trump-revises-his-position-on-social-security","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It's not uncommon for a politician to change their position on one or a number of issues. In fact, it's not even uncommon for them to change party affiliations! But when you are Donald Trump and you say pretty much anything, people tend to listen and often expect to hear some outlandish statement delivered in an equally outrageous manner. He's a ratings machine for sure. However, when Trump discusses Social Security he has proven to be generally more informed than most of his Republican competitors. <br/> <br/> <strong>  To be clear, I am not a supporter of Mr. Trump. </strong> I find offensive his statements about John McCain not being a war hero and many of his other disparaging comments that we have all heard by now. Nevertheless, sometimes buried in all his rhetoric are some interesting commentary worth pondering. <br/> <br/> Recently, Mr. Trump changed his position on extending the Full Retirement Age for social security benefits. When Scott Pelly of 60 Minutes asked Mr. Trump if he still wanted to delay the full retirement age to 70, he said \"No. I don't think we should do that anymore. I want to take back money that we are sending to other countries that want to kill us, and without increases, and we are not going to raise the social security age\". <br/> <br/> If you are interested in looking up which countries we send foreign aid to and how much we send you can go to \" <u>  <a href=\"http://foreignassistance.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   foreignassistance.gov  </a> </u> \". There is no question that the US sends billions of dollars each year to countries we have significant issues with. I am not going to address this particular matter in this blog however but what interested me most was Mr. Trump's decision to no longer support extending the full retirement age to age 70. He now wishes to keep things as they are. <br/> <br/> So what's his motivation behind this significant change in policy affecting social security? His new thinking probably lies in his past position on social security. On March 15, 2013, while addressing the Conservative Political Action Committee in Washington, Mr. Trump stated \"As Republicans, if you think you are going to change very substantially for the worse Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security in any substantial way, and at the same time you think you are going to win elections, it just really is not going to happen\".  <br/> <br/> Mr. Trump went on to say at the same gathering, <strong>  \"Social Security faces a problem: 77 million baby boomers are set to retire. Now I know there are some Republicans who would be just fine with letting these programs wither and die on the vine. The way they see it, Social Security and Medicare are wasteful \"entitlement programs\". But people who think this way need to rethink their position. It's not unreasonable for people who paid into the system for decades to expect to get their money's worth- that's not an \"entitlement\", that's honoring a deal\". </strong>   <br/> <br/> And there you have it. Mr. Trump apparently understands one fundamental element of social security, and that is that social security is a very important issue for millions of Americans preparing for retirement <strong>  and it is not realistic to expect to win an election if you propose to make drastic changes to the program. </strong> <br/> <br/> There is no question that changes need to be made to Social Security in order to protect it's long term viability for all future beneficiaries. Whether Mr. Trumps latest plan to infuse Social Security with cash by cancelling foreign aid to anti-American countries would be sufficient or appropriate is yet to be determined. It's certainly an issue that will create a lot of debate and interest, a fact I'm sure that did not escape The Donald!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 20:01:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 20:01:58.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_FKMaM4r.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/donald-trump-revises-his-position-on-social-security/\", \"post_id\": \"6722\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 20:01:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 20:01:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"donald-trump-revises-his-position-on-social-security\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6721\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3093\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-12-at-1.12.18-PM-2.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"626\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444755600,"author_id":47,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3006,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How the Lean Startup Evolved from Lean","link":"how-the-lean-startup-evolved-from-lean","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Startup founders are bombarded with books, articles, and podcasts every day by well-meaning friends and colleagues who want them to succeed:</p><p> &ldquo;You GOTTA read this!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;You GOTTA listen to this!&rdquo;</p><p> When in actuality, 95% of the content recommended, doesn&rsquo;t apply to your situation. The content that does apply can usually be condensed into pages or bullet points. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2010/08/05/why-startup-founders-should-stop-reading-business-books/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rob Walling  </a> </u>  says,&rdquo; you need laser-focused books (or better yet blogs, podcasts and mentors) that speak in-depth about your particular situation.&rdquo;</p><p> The Lean Startup was one of those books (and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blogs  </a> </u> ) that applied to everybody&rsquo;s situation.</p><p> When Eric Ries started blogging about Lean back in 2008, he made it clear that HE was not introducing an entirely new concept. Rather, he was trying to show how an existing manufacturing process &mdash; lean &mdash; could be applied to startups.</p><p> <strong>  A tale of two readers </strong></p><p> For serious entrepreneurs, the book was a godsend. It made sense immediately, like a great big &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment. Lean articulated what they sorta knew, but weren&rsquo;t fully putting into practice. Reading about Toyota, Henry Ford, and  <strong>  Kanban </strong>  made them hungry for more. In fact, for these entrepreneurs, Reis&rsquo; book was just an appetizer. They devoured everything they could about Lean &mdash; primary sources, more books, blog posts, podcasts, conferences, and meetups.</p><p> For less serious entrepreneurs, Ries&rsquo; book wasn&rsquo;t so much a new application as it was gospel truth. Overnight, lean evangelists were born. They dropped the a-word ( <u>  agile </u> ), p-word (pivot), and i-word (iterate) wherever possible, even when it was off-base and inappropriate (not to mention dorky). The problem was that because lean made building great products look easy, essential concepts and definitions were glossed over. That&rsquo;s why some less patient lean disciples, get prickly when they bump into new converts.</p><p> Mass movements are always a little funky.</p><p> <strong>  Lean ain&rsquo;t no fad </strong></p><p> Lean only sounds like a fad if you hadn&rsquo;t heard about it prior to Ries, but the roots run deep. Depending on who you ask, it goes back either decades or <a href=\"http://www.strategosinc.com/just_in_time.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   centuries  </u> </a> . Lean&rsquo;s intense customer focus and &ldquo;respect for people&rdquo; management-style has been included in the curriculum of top business schools since the 1980s.</p><p> Ries&rsquo; genius was taking what he saw in one place (the assembly line) and applying it somewhere else (a startup). This is a textbook example of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.claytonchristensen.com/key-concepts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   disruptive innovation  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s changed how startups bring a product to market and increasingly, how large corporations roll out new products.</p><p> The more you learn about lean &mdash; beyond the startup &mdash; the more opportunity you&rsquo;ll find in the world. Your brain has a funny way of pulling  <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steve-jobs-death-apple-calligraphy-248900\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   inspiration  </u>    </a> from what you learn and observe. Besides, what&rsquo;s funnier than a grab bag of Japanese words? I can&rsquo;t think of anything!</p><p> Lean as a concept is also both simple and complex. For example, take a look at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/lean-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lean for Dummies  </a> </u> . Not so dumb, right? Contrary to what recent converts think, lean has never been an invitation to simply copy what successful startups do (spoiler alert! Origin stories aren&rsquo;t always  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/2/27/kairos-co-founder-brian-brackeen-reveals-raw-truth-beyond-idealized-view-startups/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trustworthy  </a> </u> ). When you can explain lean concepts coherently, you&rsquo;ll be able to drown out useless noise about lean, but still track the progress of the movement.</p><p> So, what follows is a list of popular lean/lean startup terms with definitions and examples. Test yourself. When you note the slight but important differences between lean and lean startup, you can see why they&rsquo;ve gotten so  <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jaymelone/is-your-product-team-really-lean-fd7a39e31ce5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mangled  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Value </strong>  &mdash; that which is important to the customer. Value-added work is something your customer is willing to pay for. They would miss it if it disappeared. Both  Lean  and  Lean Startup&rsquo;s  version of value is not tied to anything intrinsic (i.e., gold or diamonds), but is based on perception.</p><p> <strong>  Innovation </strong>  &mdash; a new product, method, idea. In  lean  terms, innovation is simply anything new, including a division working within a company. In lean startup terms, <a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2010/06/what-is-startup.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   innovation  </u> </a>  can be repurposing an existing technology for a new use, devising a new business model, or even simply bringing a product or service to a new location or set of customers previously underserved.</p><p> <strong>  Waste </strong>  &mdash; or Mura, Muri, Muda. Confused? Waste in  lean  terms is the 7 Ws: defects, overproduction, transportation, waiting, inventory, motion, processing. In  lean startup  terms, waste is anything that doesn&rsquo;t add value (no matter how much you might like it).</p><p> <strong>  Risk </strong>  &mdash; exposure to the chance of loss. All businesses have risk. In  lean  terms, it might be introducing a new feature. For  lean startups , the risks are three: technical, customer and business model risk. According to one of Ries&rsquo; partners,  <u>  <a href=\"http://how.co/lean-startup-101/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer risk  </a> </u>  is the most common uncertainty among startups. In fact, she says, you should always assume that to be true.</p><p> <strong>  Pivot </strong>  &mdash; a change in strategy, based on what you&rsquo;ve learned about your customers and/or market. In  lean  terms, continual improvement <strong>  (Kaizen) </strong> is always the goal, using a work cycle called PDCA (plan, do, check, act). In  lean startup  terms, the cycle is  <u>  Learn </u> ,  <u>  Build </u> , Measure.</p><p> A textbook example of a pivot is YouTube. The product started out as a dating site where customers made videos of themselves. Somewhere along the way, the founders realized that dating was a losing model, and switched to general interest (cat) videos.</p><p> <strong>   Pull System </strong>  &mdash; a method for controlling the flow of resources by replacing only what has been consumed. It&rsquo;s flexible. In  lean  terms, this looks like a vending machine that gets restocked once everything&rsquo;s been sold. The customers are pulling more candy bars. In  lean startup  terms, this could be watching how customers react to your product and building on the features they &ldquo;pull.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  (Continuous) Flow </strong>  &mdash; moving products through a production system without separating them into lots. In lean terms, this would be building a Toyota to completion on the assembly line and sending it to a waiting customer (pull). In lean startup terms, flow is establishing a work rhythm where you are most productive. It&rsquo;s based on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flow  </a> </u>  book.</p><p> Although Eric Ries is obviously a teacher at heart, he&rsquo;s no academic. Most academics are happy to let their work collect dust in anonymity. Their employer, the university, is also happy with that arrangement. Ries wrote  The Lean Startup  after years of studying Lean. He put it out there, for the world to see, criticize and ACT upon.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening. Entrepreneurs are building products and starting companies armed with a little bit of lean knowledge. The ones that know lean better are probably building and starting companies faster and more successfully. Lean fanboys are just&hellip; talking.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-12 20:04:57.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-12 20:04:57.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_vHLcDpK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-the-lean-startup-evolved-from-lean/\", \"post_id\": \"6724\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-12 20:04:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-12 20:04:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-the-lean-startup-evolved-from-lean\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6723\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3094\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-12-at-1.06.46-PM.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"621\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444762800,"author_id":217,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3007,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Use WhatsApp to Close #SocialSelling Deals","link":"how-to-use-whatsapp-to-close-socialselling-deals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In my travels talking about Social Selling, I constantly get the objection about the use of social in the sales process. &ldquo;Social is for kids&rdquo; is the usual comment. In my discussions and panel sessions I usually find that most people come round to &ldquo;get&rdquo; the need for personal branding and the use of social for demand generation. But what about using social as part of the day-to-day sales routine? What about using social during a sales pursuit? What about closing using social?</p><h3> Anybody using social as part of a sales pursuit?</h3><p> <br/> Having seen for myself the return on investment (ROI) social selling has given many companies for over two years, I decided to put out a question on social and ask &ldquo;Anybody out there using social for things other than demand generation&rdquo;. Stop the &ldquo;naysayers&rdquo; once and for all.</p><p> I received a number of replies, one of which became the blog &ldquo; <u>  The secret of social media success for small businesses </u> &ldquo;, in addition, Nick Mararangi (@NickManarangi) contacted me. He told me he had closed business using social.</p><p> I had a great interview with Nick, he explained how he used social, as well has his fears for the future of the B2B sales person.</p><h3> The Interview</h3><p> <br/> Nick works in a classic B2B sales environment. He is head up a sales team that sells conferences and events focused on food. His delegates are food producers and he is looking for sponsorship from people trying to sell to them. He tried to sell to me, good try Nick. </p><h3> There&rsquo;s too much noise and distraction for my customers to hear my message</h3><p> <br/> Nick explained the classic issue that all of us face. There is too much noise and distraction out in the market. So we do things that free us from these distractions. We don&rsquo;t answer our phones, let calls go to voice mail. Decide which of the voice mails we have time to respond to. Just delete emails. As we do it, we know our customers and prospects are doing it too.</p><p> In the days of letters and faxes, the trick was to not send letters as personal assistant would filter them out. Faxes were seen as a higher priority to respond to, so if you sent your mailshot via the fax you had a higher chance of getting it on the decision maker&rsquo;s desk. How times change&hellip; or do they?</p><h3> I&rsquo;ve tried everything to get through to my contact &ndash; what about WhatsApp?!</h3><p> <br/> Nick was trying to get hold of a particular decision maker; he had tried everything to communicate with them. He had tried some regular as well as some &ldquo;cocial&rdquo; tricks. Phone, left voice mails, LinkedIn InMails, contacted them over Twitter and retweeted their Twitter posts, but no response. Nick therefore tried using WhatsApp &ndash; he plugged the number into WhatsApp and he got a response. It just so happened that the contact was travelling and WhatsApp was the easiest thing for the person to access while they were in the airport.</p><p> The advice I always give people about social networks is to go to where your customers are, even if it seems &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.</p><p> It gets better. Nick decided to take the conversation on WhatsApp to a close and won that sale using instant messaging! Kaboom!</p><p> After congratulating Nick we carried on talk about his view on the future of selling and future of social selling.</p><h3> Social selling is a journey &ndash; be a lifelong learner</h3><p> <br/> Nick described himself as a lifelong learner, and we agreed that was necessary if you want to start a journey into social selling as things can change quickly. Also experiment. Social is still in the infancy, sp try new things, like we always did in the offline world.</p><p> Back to Nick: &ldquo;You are always looking for a new way to get your sales signal over the noise. I&rsquo;m sure in 6 months when everybody has read your blog, I won&rsquo;t be able to use WhatsApp anymore. But I will have moved on and found something else.&rdquo;</p><h3> Social Selling isn&rsquo;t a 9 to 5</h3><p> <br/> Nick is also of the belief (as am I) that sales is not a 9 to 5 role. The lines of &ldquo;prime selling time&rdquo; are blurred as people start to accept LinkedIn invites, InMail, etc outside of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; work hours. Nick is a great believer that today&rsquo;s sales person must be able to adapt and incorporate this into their work ethic. Nick&rsquo;s view was that for any salesperson who thinks sales is 9 to 5 &ldquo;needs a mindset change&rdquo;.</p><h3> The salesperson of the future?</h3><p> <br/> He laments the loss of the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; telesales floor, particularly in publishing and job board sites which was the learning ground for so many people in his industry.</p><p> His view was these sales floors would give bright, hungry &ldquo;kids&rdquo; an entry level route to sales with the potential of earning big money.

{"original_id":3008,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Empowering or Demotivating Your People?","link":"are-you-empowering-or-demotivating-your-people","source_link":null,"content":"<p> &ldquo;You go ahead, I&rsquo;m right behind you!&rdquo;</p><p> That line has been used so often, to either set-up comedy routines (where the speaker then hides or heads off in the other direction), or hint who is going to get killed next in B movies.</p><p> So much so that, now, we almost can&rsquo;t take seriously the idea that the person not leading the way could have the other person&rsquo;s best interests at heart.</p><p> What about you as a leader of a customer insight function? How do you balance when to take the lead yourself &amp; when to empower others to take centre stage? The right balance between effective empowerment &amp; abdication can be a tricky one to judge. Do you have a handle on this one?</p><p> I&rsquo;d like to suggest some  things to consider when facing this challenge, but don&rsquo;t want to pretend to have all the answers. As with most leaders, I look back on my time creating &amp; leading insight teams (up to 44 people strong), with a mixture of pride &amp; guilt. There are always things you wish you&rsquo;d done better. But then quite often it is the mistakes I made that have taught me what works better.</p><p> Here are four things to consider when seeking to achieve empowerment and avoid abdication:</p><p> <strong>  We are all individuals. What works for them? </strong></p><p> Given that the felt experience for your team member is all about their perception. The best place to start may be in getting to know them better. Are they extrovert or introvert? Do they crave creative freedom or clear direction? Which aspects of the job have they mastered &amp; where might they run into problems? How have they responded in the past?</p><p> Depending on the maturity of your relationship, a good place to start can be an open conversation. If you layout your desire for them to grow &amp; experience more responsibility, be sure to do plenty of listening to both how they feel about that and what approach/support they feel works best for them.</p><p> <strong>  The role of incisive questions. </strong></p><p> We can all be limited by our beliefs, about ourselves, others and challenges we may face at work. Your team member may have had negative previous experiences or suffered from a micro-managing boss in the past. If you are to help them overcome &lsquo;limiting beliefs&lsquo;, it makes sense to look at coaching theory.</p><p> In her  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/books/book-review-time-to-think/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bestseller &ldquo;Time to Think&rdquo;  </a> </u> , Nancy Kline proposes a style of questioning called Incisive Questioning. It is all about asking a question that will enable the other person to reconsider the art of the possible. The question is called incisive because it cuts cleanly into the limiting belief (assumption) and removes it.  Here are 3 steps she proposes to construct an incisive question:</p><li> Hypothesise (&lsquo;If you knew&hellip;&rsquo;)</li><li> Follow with a freeing true assumption (&lsquo;that you understand this customer behaviour really well &amp; are a great analyst&hellip;&rsquo;)</li><li> Attach that new assumption to the goal (&lsquo;how would you feel presenting your work at X meeting?&rsquo;) <br/>  </li><p> Now, it&rsquo;s never as simple as that &amp; skill comes by practicing. I&rsquo;d just encourage trying incisive questioning as part of empowering an analyst to try something new &amp; challenging?</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Have+you+tried+%23IncisiveQuestioning+to+%23empower+an+%23analyst+to+do+something+%23challenging%3F&amp;via=LaughlinPaul&amp;related=LaughlinPaul&amp;url=http://customerinsightleader.com/?p=1349\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Have you tried #IncisiveQuestioning to #empower an #analyst to do something #challenging?  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  First they observe, then you observe, next time they can do it. </strong></p><p> There is an old guideline for effective delegation that I&rsquo;ve found helps protect against some of the pitfalls when seeing to &rsquo;empower&rsquo; someone. It suggests that when handing over responsibility for something that the other person has not done before, you plan 3 stages of practice.</p><p> In the first, they come along to observe you completing the task, with opportunity to question or feedback afterwards (depending on the setting). The second time, they try doing it themselves, but you are also there as a support or observer. This enables you to provide clear feedback on how they did in action. Only on a third occasion should they be expected to deliver that presentation or undertake the task on their own &amp; even then you should seek feedback from their customers or others impacted. It&rsquo;s a simple rubric but can work well.</p><p> <strong>  Be aware of the impact you have on others. </strong></p><p> Finally, let&rsquo;s return to the theme of the impact people have on others. This time, instead of considering their internal beliefs, consider what impact you have on others. Less experienced leaders in particular can feel under pressure to perform or appear confident. Given many leaders are &ldquo;driver&rdquo; personality types, this can backfire in their impact on others. People in their team may perceive them as uncaring, demanding, overly political, critical or just not interested in them.</p><p> In a study on &ldquo;coaching Emotionally Intelligent Leadership&ldquo; , Jonathan Perks &amp; Prof Bar-On identify the need for a leader to have interpersonal capabilities &amp; adaptability. Under &lsquo;inter-personal&rsquo; they include aspects like empathy, relationship building &amp; social concern. Coupled with a flexibility to adapt one&rsquo;s own style to work better for each team member, such competency can be very powerful.</p><p> Just one simple example is the management idea of  &ldquo;catching someone doing something good&rdquo; . In an environment of seeking to challenge &amp; stretch potential future leaders in the team, it can be so refreshing for you to also watch out for &amp; praise what they do well. It can dispel misconceptions as to your view of them.</p><p> <strong>  Over to you&hellip; </strong></p><p> Part of the responsibility of customer insight leaders is to both nurture the next generation of leaders &amp; to enable your team to work to the best of their ability. None of the above is anything approaching a silver bullet, nor is it rocket science. But I would encourage customer insight leaders, amongst the  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/the-hybrid-ci-leader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   many hats you have to wear  </a> </u> , to give time to reflect on how well you&rsquo;re empowering your team.

{"original_id":3009,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Robo-Proof Your Financial Advisory Firm","link":"how-to-robo-proof-your-financial-advisory-firm","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The robo-advisor and its collision with traditional advisors has become a media staple. Conversations focused on robos and the changing landscape of technology take center stage among financial advisors and industry leaders. Warnings of fee compression and competitive automated services that robos provide are abound in the headlines.</p><p> There seems to be no argument that robo-advisors are driving change in the financial services industry. The debatable questions holding strong are, &ldquo;To what degree is the robo invasion imposing threats in the traditional advisor space?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Is there an urgent need to compete with them to remain viable?&rdquo;</p><p> Robo-advisors come in a variety of fashions that focus on low cost and offer an array of options from online investment services, subscription options, and combo packages; offering both online and human assistance. The idea of automated computer algorithms that allocate, redistribute, and rebalance investments with minimal human interaction appeals to some, while others are not warming up to the idea.</p><p> Is the digital explosion of online wealth management a threat to our once comfortable human-to-human interaction? Or, is this the harsh push needed for traditional advisors to embrace new technology that most have been slow to adapt?</p><h3> How Robos Are Impacting Traditional Advisory Firms </h3><p> <br/> The impact of social, mobile, and digital technology is blatantly apparent. Client expectations have changed as consumers utilize online resources as a first step to find products and services, and financial advice is no exception. Consumers who interact with companies online are 40 percent more likely to buy products and services from them; which tells us there is a key shift in the way consumers determine who to do business with.&sup1; They are expressing confidence and trust in technology to help them make educated decisions.</p><p> While robo-advisors have garnered more than $19 billion in assets&sup2;, a survey by Accenture says that just 19 percent of U.S. and Canadian advisors see robos as a severe threat.&sup3; The survey goes on to say that some advisors still have plans to integrate robo-advisors into their business as part of an inexpensive way to serve the Henry investors (High Earning Not Rich Yet) who may become full-service clients.⁴</p><p> <strong>  Evan Shear-CFP&reg; </strong> , founding partner at  <u>  CrossleyShear Wealth Management </u> , covers all aspects of financial planning at his practice in Florida. When asked how robo-advisors have or will impact his firm, Mr. Shear says, &ldquo;I think the idea of a robo-advisor should wake all of us up in that we need to refine and strive to differentiate ourselves and our services offered. We don&rsquo;t feel it will diminish our practice. We could lose some that don&rsquo;t need or want real advice from real people, but those are not the type of clients we wish to work with.&rdquo;</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183815/investors-prefer-mix-human-digital-financial-advice.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent Gallup poll  </a> </u>  helps calm advisor anxiety concerning robos. The survey cites that more than 85 percent of investors want to have some level of access to human advisors, even if digital tools are involved in their investment decisions. The results of the survey show that human advisors can be assured they have a role in providing value to clients.</p><p> <strong>  Rex Whiteside </strong> , President of  <u>  <a href=\"http://whitesidewealthmanagement.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Whiteside Wealth Management, Inc.  </a> </u>  in Houston, Texas, tells us, &ldquo;It (robo-advisors) has caused us to raise our level of service in planning as investment management has become less of a differentiator. Just as younger and smaller investors have benefited from the automation of investment management, advisors are also benefiting. We have been able to increase our services at a lower cost and with less staff.&rdquo;</p><p> Technological development and the automated advice platforms offered by robos pose as a threat to some advisors and make it difficult to compete, especially against their lower fees. On the other hand, there are a number of advisors who feel confident that their clients, referral networks, and centers of influence will alleviate the robo challenge, while others are taking steps to shield their firm from any potential attack.</p><p> In short, it seems most advisors will work toward a solution that capitalizes on offering additional services, incorporate workflows and processes to operate more efficiently, and deliver valuable, high-level client service.</p><h3> What Investors Want That Robos Can&rsquo;t Provide </h3><p> <br/> Traditional advisors can benefit from the influx of robos by taking a look at one key question, &ldquo;What do investors want that robos can&rsquo;t provide?&rdquo; A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/study--investors-want-advisors-to-steady-the-ship-23183.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent survey by Investment Management Consultants Association  </a> </u>  (IMCA) found that investors seek four primary services, none of which robos can deliver:</p><li> Help to maintain a long-term investing approach</li><li> Reassurance when markets are volatile</li><li> Keep them informed of current tax law changes</li><li> Provide access to cutting-edge investment strategies <br/>  </li><p> &ldquo;To most investors, cutting-edge strategies don&rsquo;t have to do with aligning the best funds or timing the market,&rdquo; says Sean Walters, IMCA CEO. &ldquo;It has to do with helping clients align their objectives, finding the right allocations and buckets for their planning. Clients want to feel confident that the processes their advisors use have a long-term outlook.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Investors need/want solutions to holistic planning and investment management,&rdquo; says Whiteside. &ldquo;With a robo you can attempt to align your investments with your risk tolerance but how do you tie your investments to your financial goals and needs? We also find one of the largest aspects of successful investment management ties into behavior. This is behavior during both good and bad market cycles. Understanding the client&rsquo;s state of mind during periods of fear and greed avoids possible tragic mistakes. When emotions enter the equation, I think the automated robo advisor falls short.&rdquo;</p><p> Shear adds, &ldquo;People want someone that can relate to their concerns, issues, problems, and dreams. A machine cannot do that. A machine doesn&rsquo;t know the pain of losing a parent and how to deal with costs associated with caring for a loved one. We have lived those real life events and can apply our experiences with our clients.&rdquo;</p><p> What investors want are services that can&rsquo;t typically be delivered well by a robo-advisor, creating the opportunity for traditional advisors to market their human touch.</p><h3> The Opportunity for Traditional Advisors &ndash; 10-Steps to Robo-Proof Your Advisory Firm</h3><p> <br/> Robo-advisors are not likely to be a passing trend. Advisors should view their disturbance as a wakeup call to clearly communicate human advisor differentiation. Investors seek greater value from financial advisors. Advisors can embrace this disruption and use it to their advantage by creating an efficient, high-touch, personal service offering to clients.</p><p> Whiteside says his firm has taken steps to stay competitive with robos. &ldquo;(We) have increased efficiency by going paperless, and incorporated Riskalyze.com (a risk alignment platform) to better understand our clients&rsquo; true risk tolerance &ndash; then match it with a customized investment solution. In addition, we utilize performance reporting that centers around clients&rsquo; needed return and not just benchmarks.&rdquo;</p><p> What specific steps can you take to compete, survive, and remain relevant in a new investment and wealth management environment? There are tactics your firm can deploy to minimize effects of the robo-advisor platform, and continue to attract ideal clients while improving the services you provide. This will involve communicating the advantages of your service model and incorporating a clearly defined process that differentiates and distances you from robo-advisors.</p><h3> 1) Anticipate Needs</h3><li> Be proactive and aware of the needs in your market. Provide answers to commonly asked questions that surround the challenges facing your ideal client. This information needs to be readily available, in an organized and convenient location on your website.</li><h3> 2) Know Your Unique Value Proposition</h3><li> A  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pershing.com/our-thinking/thought-leadership/what-do-top-advisors-say-and-what-do-investors-really-think\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent Pershing Study  </a> </u>  cites 60 percent of investors found it hard to distinguish among advisors because most said the same things and made the same promises. Your value proposition statement needs to answer the question, &ldquo;Why should I choose to do business with you?&rdquo;</li><h3> 3) Actively Engage on Social Media</h3><li> Establish relationships on social media and create a process to convert leads to clients. The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.putnam.com/advisor/content/advisorTechTips/2488-2015-putnam-investments-social-advisor-survey/?pr=091615\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Social Advisor Study performed by Putnam Investments  </a> </u>  reveals the use of social media by advisors is lending results. Seventy-nine percent of advisors report acquiring new clients through social media this year, versus 66 percent last year. Social media is one of the highest returns on investments you can make because the majority of prospects will research an advisor online before ever considering doing business with them.</li><h3> 4) Host Client Events</h3><li> Client events help you strengthen relationships, provide an opportunity to network with potential clients, and position you as an expert and trusted resource. Choose topics that are important to your market, even if it means hosting several small events. Small targeted events may require more work on your part, but the bottom line is &ndash; if you know more about your clients and their network of friends, you&rsquo;ll glean higher attendance rates with more prospective client potential.</li><h3> 5) Become a Specialist</h3><li> Don&rsquo;t be everything to everyone. A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.benefitspro.com/2013/10/15/edge-goes-to-specialist-advisors-cerulli-finds\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study by Cerulli  </a> </u> , a Boston-based analytics firm, says that only 15 percent of advisors are specialists. You can use that low percentage to your advantage. Choose your specialty and utilize technology to tailor services to a specific group of clients and prospects. Adding a specialty makes it difficult for robo-advisors to compete and will position you to be sought out by those seeking your services.</li><h3> 6) Communicate with Clients</h3><li> Research tells us that one of the most common reasons for clients jumping ship to a new advisor is due to lack of communication; yet many firms don&rsquo;t have a formal communication plan in place. Client communication is a key component in your business and marketing plan. A solid communication strategy will increase: client retention, satisfaction, and referrals. Creating a successful communication plan will enhance client relationships provided you determine what communication methods clients prefer and expect versus methods that are easiest for your firm.</li><h3>  7) Provide Other Areas of Financial Service</h3><li> &ldquo;Move the focus to full holistic wealth management that encompasses a client&rsquo;s entire financial picture,&rdquo; says Whiteside. &ldquo;Prioritize the issues that need to be addressed and coordinate with other professionals, like CPAs and attorneys.&rdquo; These are the types of services that robos can&rsquo;t provide and investors want. By providing additional layers of advice and service to your clients, you are able to provide them with more value.</li><h3> 8) Re-invent Your Marketing Message</h3><li> Social, mobile, and digital make marketing so much easier. Advisors have the ability to reach markets they never thought would be possible. No matter how great your products and services are the success of your firm will be limited without effective marketing. Marketing is about educating and communicating your value to your market, developing a relationship, and setting the stage for a solution when clients and prospects are ready to buy.</li><h3> 9) Offer Selected Services Online</h3><li> Consider offering a select number of services online. Your digital services could include educational materials, market commentaries, and performance reports. Reserve comprehensive wealth management and planning services for in-person meetings. The list of available technology, covering everything from client-relationship management to investment research, can seem overwhelming. Adopting some of these technologies such as e-signatures, cloud-based file-sharing, and video conferencing can free you from the confines of your geographical market. A good place to start is to survey your clients. Ask which services they want to use online and automate what you can.</li><h3> 10) Don&rsquo;t Forget Next-Gen</h3><li> While the millennial generation leans their preference to many &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; services, research suggests they are not shunning a trusted advisor. More importantly, according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/22/great-wealth-transfer-will-be-30-trillionyes-thats-trillion-with-a-t.html\" target=\"_blank\">   study from consulting firm Accenture  </a> </u> , over $30 trillion will transfer from one generation to another over the next few decades. A recent report by Salesforce indicates the majority of millennials prefer having an advisor and represent the generation most interested in one-on-one interaction with an advisor &ndash; 47 percent receive investment advice face-to-face, versus 36 percent of Gen X-ers and 46 percent of Baby Boomers.⁵ The desire to collaborate with advisors, express financial concerns and goals, and to learn how to manage money is undoubtedly apparent.</li><h3> Maintaining a Thriving Advisory Practice </h3><p> <br/> In conclusion, robo-advisors are shaking up the world of wealth management. The disruption doesn&rsquo;t have to be detrimental to your practice.

It&rsquo;s a common word. I love its mystique. It should be an all-the-time thing, but people who think they have a good one often slip at the first hint of trouble. The others, who maintain a good one with regularity, are likely getting help from attitude&rsquo;s brethren of the faith variety. All will always turn out well.</p><p> Attitude is also similar in nature to self-esteem. Someone can&rsquo;t give it to you. You have to build it on your own. It&rsquo;s lonely and self-taught.</p><p> How can you teach yourself to develop a winning attitude?</p><p> How you think and what you think about&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Focus on your passions. </strong> Give yourself a leg up by focusing on the things you love. It&rsquo;s much easier to develop a great attitude when you&rsquo;re doing something you love. Not sure what you&rsquo;re passionate about?

Start small. Repeat. Think back on your life. Have you, for the most part, been successful? If so, why would you allow the thought of some fictitious improbable future prevent you from thinking positively at this moment? It&rsquo;s actually more likely that all will turn out well. Try it. It works.</p><p> <strong>  Slow down the speed of your emotions. </strong> When you catch yourself thinking negatively, take a deep breath. You need to practice becoming mindful of your racing thoughts because your automatic thinking and behaviors have unfortunately become automatic.</p><p> The environment you build for yourself&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Set goals high and monitor progress instead of specific results. </strong> Being realistic never changed anything. Being &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo; does. Set goals for yourself that are higher than you can imagine. This might sound contrary to breeding positivity and it will be if all you focus on are the outcomes of your attempts. Enjoy the journey along the way and pay attention to what you&rsquo;re accomplishing as opposed to the target goal you set for yourself. It&rsquo;s the one time I suggest you look back in proportion to looking forward. Get into process and out of outcome. Read  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/books/out-of-reach-but-in-sight/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Out of Reach But in Sight: Using Goals to Achieve Your Impossible  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Make sure you can commit. </strong> Setting high goals is ridiculous if you can&rsquo;t commit to working toward and achieving them. This exercise also involves determining the things in your life you will need to sacrifice to achieve what you want.</p><p> Behavior plays a key part&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t ever give up&mdash;being true to yourself. </strong> Let&rsquo;s get something straight. Winners quit. They quit the right things at the right times. They also choose the right things to start and focus only on those things. That&rsquo;s why you wouldn&rsquo;t consider thinking of them as quitters. If you&rsquo;ve entangled yourself in something that isn&rsquo;t your passion, be true to yourself and find something else that is. It&rsquo;s your life. You&rsquo;re only lying to yourself if you continue doing something you don&rsquo;t want to.</p><p> <strong>  Make no excuses. </strong> You are a victim of your own vibration. You are accountable for everything you do and everything that happens to you. Accept it. Own it. If you ignored the other thirteen items in this post, this one alone will carry you to the right place.</p><p> Relationships make the world go &lsquo;round&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Surround yourself with the right people. </strong> You&rsquo;re the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Do the math. Relationships are meant to empower you and should never victimize you. If any relationship isn&rsquo;t helping you become who you want to be, walk away. Speaking of&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Avoid the wrong people. </strong> I call this addition by subtraction. It&rsquo;s different than surrounding yourself with the right people and a little more painful.</p><p> A healthy mindset gives you stylish rose-colored glasses&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Be grateful. </strong> It&rsquo;s impossible to have a bad attitude when you have gratitude. Be grateful for everything you have because there are people who will never have what you have today.</p><p> <strong>  Believe. </strong> Whether you think you can or can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re right. Whether you think you will or won&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ve never met a person I didn&rsquo;t believe in and I know more people than anyone I know. If I believe in you, you should too.</p><p> <strong>  Have faith. </strong> Pair faith with belief and all will turn out well. I pinky swear.</p><p> Plan, do, learn, fix, and repeat&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Prepare for the best, worst, and everything in between. </strong>  You&rsquo;ll sleep better at night knowing you have all contingencies covered.</p><p> <strong>  Learn. </strong> Your life will never get easier, but I assure you, you will get wiser.

Landmark. Groundbreaking. Revolutionary.</p><p> These are among many of the words that have been used lately to describe the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, which was finally signed in Atlanta last Monday by 12 participating Pacific Rim nations.</p><p> The current members include Canada, the United States, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p> <img alt=\"runners on the starting line\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/COMM-the-12-apostles-of-the-historic-trans-pacific-partnership-10092015.png\"/></p><p> After nearly seven years of negotiations, the TPP promises to deliver unprecedented free and fair global trade among the 12 participant nations.</p><p> Once ratified by each country&rsquo;s congress or parliament&mdash;which is likely to happen in early 2016&mdash;the accord will become the most significant, most economically-impactful trade deal in history. As many as 18,000 tariffs are expected to be eliminated. It will remove barriers to foreign investment, streamline customs procedures and create an international investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system, among much more.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/COMM-2014-trade-estimates-global-tpp-china-10092015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global Purchasing Managers' Index Continues to Deteriorate\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/COMM-2014-trade-estimates-global-tpp-china-10092015.png\"/> </a></p><p> The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, predicts that the resultant savings could boost the world economy by an incredible $223 billion by 2025.</p><p> Today, the 12 members control more than a quarter of all global trade, representing close to $10 trillion. But it&rsquo;s estimated that once the TPP goes live, the trade percentage could climb to as high as 50 percent, according to CLSA.</p><p> The trade pact couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time. Global growth is slowing, and mounting tariffs threaten to suffocate trade. Even though the TPP&rsquo;s full implementation is months and, in some cases, years away, it&rsquo;s encouraging to know that positive change is on its way.</p><p> Having said that, no one knows the full details yet and it might be a while before we can see the official documents. When that time comes, we&rsquo;ll analyze the deal to see which countries, industries and sectors stand to benefit the most. And of course the pact has already become the subject of criticism, targeted specifically at how it handles pharmaceuticals and intellectual property.</p><p> All in all, however, the world has needed such an agreement for years now to bring unilateral trade liberalization into the 21st century.</p><h3> China Misses First-Mover Advantage but Isn&rsquo;t out of the Race</h3><p> <br/> The most notable player missing-in-action is China, and to a lesser extent Korea, both of which have taken a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; attitude. That will likely change in the coming years. China sat this round out because the trade deal would have imposed several stringent economic, labor and environmental conditions on the Asian giant, as it does on all TPP nations.</p><img alt=\" governments must learn to balance monetary and fiscal policies to remain competitive globally\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/COMM-less-spanish-more-mandarin-advertisers-reaching-out-to-Chinese-tourists-10092015.jpg\"/><p> But China and Korea will doubtlessly have little choice but to join the team once they see the enormous benefits enjoyed by participating countries. China&rsquo;s southern neighbor Vietnam, for instance, is expected to see a huge 10 percent boost in its GDP by 2025&mdash;twice as much as any other Asian market&mdash;according to Credit Suisse. Malaysia, a 5 percent boost.</p><p> The business relationship between the U.S. and China&mdash;the world&rsquo;s two largest economies&mdash;grows stronger every day, and China doesn&rsquo;t want to see its competitive edge dulled by other Asian countries that chose to be members of the TPP.</p><p> Here in Texas, where a lot of public signage is written in both English and Spanish, I&rsquo;m starting to see more and more Mandarin, an indicator that U.S.-China relations are strengthening. The picture of the ad, which I took at the San Marcos Premium Outlets mall just north of San Antonio, is clearly targeted to Chinese tourists. It&rsquo;s an ad for China Merchants Bank and reads: &ldquo;In America, use Merchants Bank credit card! Very American!&rdquo;</p><h3> Vietnam Will See the Biggest Long-Term Economic Benefits</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Very American,&rdquo; indeed. To be clear, the real winner in the formation of the TPP is the U.S., for whom the deal is as much about geopolitics as it is about trade. In a briefing this week, the National Bank of Canada writes that the TPP &ldquo;would allow the United States to take the lead in setting the rules of commerce for about 40 percent of the global economy.&rdquo;</p><p> But as I said, Vietnam is poised to see the biggest upside potential as a result of the deal. The Southeast Asian country is a large manufacturer and exporter of textiles, apparel and footwear, all of which the U.S. currently imposes a very high 17 percent duty on. That&rsquo;s set to disappear, saving the country billions. Because foreign investment in Vietnam is expected to accelerate under the deal, banks, consumer goods and construction are also set to benefit.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/CHN-Vietnam-Poised-To-Benefit-Most-From-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement-10092015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global Purchasing Managers' Index Continues to Deteriorate\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/CHN-Vietnam-Poised-To-Benefit-Most-From-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement-10092015.png\"/> </a> <br/> Malaysia is another country that stands to see sweeping changes. Right now the country doesn&rsquo;t have a trade agreement with the U.S., Canada, Mexico or Peru. Once the deal is ratified and implemented, Malaysia&rsquo;s vital palm oil, rubber, plywood, electronics, textile and automotive parts industries will be open for business to some of the world&rsquo;s largest economies.</p><p> As for Japan, its all-important, $538 billion auto industry will receive a huge shot in the arm. Consultancy firm Eurasia Group estimates that the TPP could help add $105 billion to Japan&rsquo;s GDP by 2025.</p><h3> Say It with Me: Government Policy Is a Precursor to Change</h3><p> <br/> Not only is the Trans-Pacific Partnership great for global trade but it also promises to help bring fiscal and monetary policies into balance. The deal is a welcome and much-needed development from a fiscal perspective, one that we haven&rsquo;t seen from world governments in more than a generation. Lately, everything&rsquo;s been about monetary policy&mdash;specifically quantitative easing and currency manipulation&mdash;to stimulate growth.  A reduction in taxes, tariffs and regulation also promotes growth.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/COMM-Government-Policy-is-a-Precursor-to-Change-10092015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Top 10 Most Competitive Countries, According to the World Economic Forum\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-09/COMM-Government-Policy-is-a-Precursor-to-Change-10092015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Here at U.S. Global Investors, we often say it&rsquo;s the policy, not the party, that really matters. Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike are all capable of effecting change that can both move the U.S. forward as well as set it back.</p><p> On President Barack Obama&rsquo;s watch, many new restrictive rules and regulations have been enacted in the U.S. that clog up the flow of capital like cholesterol and hinder business growth and innovation. I&rsquo;ve written and spoken about these policies on many occasions.</p><p> At the same time, we must acknowledge that he&rsquo;s been one of the most fervent champions for the creation of the TPP, even going so far as to stand up against several prominent members of his own party. I&rsquo;m certain that in the decades to come, the TPP will emerge as the Obama administration&rsquo;s crowning foreign policy achievement.</p><h3> What the Influencers Are Saying</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;d like to end by sharing some compelling comments on the TPP by key policymakers, business leaders and economists. Their optimism should convince anyone that the TPP, once ratified, could end up being the best thing to happen to global trade in at least a generation.</p><p> To my Canadian friends and readers, I wish you a happy and blessed Canadian Thanksgiving!</p><p> Malaysia currently puts a 30 percent tax on American auto parts. Vietnam puts a tax of as much as 70 percent on every car American automakers sell in Vietnam. Under this agreement, all those foreign taxes will fall. Most of them will fall to zero. So we are knocking down barriers that are currently preventing American businesses from selling in these countries and are preventing American workers from benefiting from those sales to the fastest-growing, most dynamic region in the world. -  <strong>  U.S. President Barack Obama  </strong></p><p> This agreement in my view is truly transformational. To have one set of rules for 12 destinations is going to turbo charge regional supply chains and global supply chains and reduce costs. - <strong>  Australia Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb  </strong></p><p> Free-trade agreements create new opportunities for American companies and their workers. I thank the United States Trade Representative and fellow trade negotiators for their commitment to finalizing this agreement. U.S. companies need to be able to compete and win in global markets to support well-paying jobs at home. It&rsquo;s critical we provide our manufacturers and exporters with the best tools to compete on a level-playing field in markets worldwide. - <strong>  Boeing President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg </strong></p><p> In many parts of the world, food and agricultural products still face the legacy of high import barriers. We believe the Trans-Pacific Partnership will allow food to move more freely across borders from places of plenty to places of need, which benefits farmers and consumers around the world.  - <strong>  Cargill Chairman and CEO David MacLennan </strong>  </p><p> Canada&rsquo;s mining industry has been a strong advocate for liberalized trade and investment flows for many years. NAFTA, free trade agreements with Chile, Peru, Colombia and other countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia have all helped to increase Canadian exports and investment, supporting jobs for Canadians here and abroad. TPP, representing such a massive trade block, including critical emerging markets, is a trading partnership Canada must not risk being left out of.  - <strong>  Mining Association of Canada President and CEO Pierre Gratton </strong></p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-13 18:06:08.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-13 18:06:08.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_O8GSIh4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-these-12-tpp-nations-could-forever-change-global-growth/\", \"post_id\": \"6734\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-13 18:06:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-13 18:06:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-these-12-tpp-nations-could-forever-change-global-growth\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6733\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3100\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444720895098-cbd6b640c909-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"769\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444827600,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

He would have realized he&rsquo;d be concerned about the potential loss of stability and safety in his environment and known how to manage his reaction to the news.</p><li> Set a structured agenda and have prepared questions.</li><li> Meet in a more formal environment in the office.</li><li> Expect yes/no answers.</li><li> Offer details and analysis.</li><li> Avoid abstract ideas in communication, and keep to specifics.</li><li> Present the research performed to come to the specific conclusion.</li><li> Provide case studies as examples rather than having a high-level, conceptual discussion.</li><li> Show the risks are minimized (not eliminated) in the recommendations.</li><li> Say what you are going to do and then do it. Be very transparent.</li><li> Provide them with newsletters and books, economic information. <br/>  </li><p> How we handle responsibility for our decisions, as well as our mistakes, is a direct reflection on our character. However, without insight into our inherent communication and behavioral style we do not know our default reaction to a situation such as the Head of Marketing faced.</p><p> The President immediately put the Head of Marketing on notice saying, &ldquo;I instructed you to keep what I told you in confidence. That means you agree to keep the information completely, totally secret and not to repeat the information without permission.&rdquo; He continued, becoming even more analytical in his communication, &ldquo;asking someone to keep a confidence is a solemn contract. You broke it.&rdquo;</p><p> The Head of Marketing tried, without success, to respond. The President left the room leaving the executive confused, bruised (metaphorically speaking) and devastated that he had acted so inappropriately. His first reaction to the news was driven by feelings and a loss of certainty about his future. He&rsquo;d given no thought to the family or the consequences of such news reaching the marketplace.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-13 18:08:58.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-13 18:08:58.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_p0ZmCJO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-we-handle-responsibility-for-our-decisions-as-well-as-our-mistakes/\", \"post_id\": \"6736\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-13 18:08:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-13 18:08:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-we-handle-responsibility-for-our-decisions-as-well-as-our-mistakes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6735\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3101\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/photo-1444738720667-27446e3f293d-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"313\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444823100,"author_id":88,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":3013,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Then and Now: It's Not Your Mama or Daddy's Workplace!","link":"then-and-now-its-not-your-mama-or-daddys-workplace","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The demographic evolution that has been taking place in America, and elsewhere, over the past several years has had an irrevocable impact on the types of leaders needed to move businesses forward successfully. But, there is a significant gap between the types of leaders needed and those currently at the helm of most organizations.</p><p> Most recently, the economic climate in the United States caused many organizations to move into survival mode, shifting their attention away from initiatives that could capture the voices and reap the innovation of their diverse workforces. As the economy shows signs of improvement, some organizations have come back to the realization that, without engaged employees whose efforts can yield engaged customers, bottom lines won&rsquo;t budge.</p><p> So what it will take for a business leader to succeed in the 21st century is vastly different than what it took to succeed in the past. For leaders to ensure that businesses compete effectively in an increasingly diverse global economy, they must now be firmly focused on business initiatives that will result in more engaged employees and, in turn, more engaged and loyal customers.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at the number of massive shifts that have led us to this point.</p><p> <strong>  THEN: </strong> Past Performance Predicted Future Success</p><p> In the past, successful companies were brick and mortar enterprises with clear brand identities centered around a specific product or service. They established their prowess and held rigidly to the people, markets and processes who had created their success. They were confident&mdash;even cocky&mdash;in the belief that the successes of the past would lead to continued success in the future. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not broke, why fix it?,&rdquo; was their mantra. Unfortunately, the fundamental belief in consumers staying the same or staying loyal, which was the mainstay of corporate behemoths like Kodak, TWA, E.F. Hutton, General Foods and others, proved to be flawed.</p><p> <strong>  NOW: </strong> Companies Must Continually Innovate</p><p> Today, even the most stalwart companies and their leaders are vulnerable. The Borders and Blockbusters of the world have learned the hard way that they cannot rest on their laurels. Quite the contrary. Innovative companies like Netflix and Salesforce have demonstrated that even the &ldquo;big guys&rdquo; can be knocked from their perch. Today&rsquo;s successful leaders know that they must continually innovate, not only in products and services but also in the texture and dynamics of the workplace. They know that they must be agile and able to shift course as environmental and consumer demands shift. They know that they must have multiple methods of generating and incorporating input from a wide range of audiences to fuel future innovation. They also now see younger consumers looking at the brand as larger than a product or service&mdash;it&rsquo;s about the organization&rsquo;s social impact too.</p><p> <strong>  THEN:  </strong> It Was About Counting People</p><p> Over the last half century, we have seen increasing gains in workplace diversity starting with President Kennedy&rsquo;s signing of Executive Order 10925 in 1961, when we first saw the term &ldquo;affirmative action.&rdquo; That was more than 50 years ago, and it led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.</p><p> Meanwhile, organizations that embraced &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; seemed to focus on hiring women and people of color or focused on event-based training initiatives&mdash;a &ldquo;dip and done&rdquo; approach. Over time, these good intentions to create a more ethnically and racially diverse workforce began to focus on &ldquo;getting representation&rdquo; and educating people about differences. This has been a numbers game that, in many cases, lacked clear business linkage. Corporate America has been spinning its wheels for decades, attempting to influence change by focusing on the numbers and it hasn&rsquo;t worked because leaders failed to connect these efforts to the organization&rsquo;s business objectives.</p><p> <strong>  NOW: </strong>  It&rsquo;s About  Including  People</p><p> Becoming an inclusive leader is not about counting&mdash;it&rsquo;s about including. While many of us have learned that counting people, alone, doesn&rsquo;t work, we&rsquo;ve also learned that including people does. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many pink, purple or green people you have on staff if leadership is not capturing the insights, input and innovations of those people. Inclusion is the new business imperative. Inclusion is what will lead to real business growth on a global scale.</p><p> Inclusive leaders know that their success depends on the input of people. They know that it is critical to ensure that all of their employees have a voice. Many great ideas can emerge from the mailroom as well as the boardroom!</p><p> <strong>  THEN: </strong>  It Was About Command and Control</p><p> In the old business model, leaders told people what to do. They set the rules and they held people accountable to those rules. They had all of the answers&mdash;or so they thought. The best workers were those who showed up, did their jobs and went home. After 30 years they received a gold watch for their compliance. It was a top-down world where everybody knew their place and few dared to challenge the often oppressive status quo. But that was then.</p><p> <strong>  NOW: </strong>  It&rsquo;s About Engagement</p><p> Today&rsquo;s leaders&mdash;the good ones, the inclusive ones&mdash;recognize that their employees represent valuable capital, not because of their &ldquo;horsepower,&rdquo; but because of their &ldquo;brain power.&rdquo; Effective leaders know that their organizations can benefit by capturing the hearts and minds of their employees by seeking their input, listening and recognizing that it&rsquo;s not just the people at the top who create value. Good ideas come from everywhere! And those good ideas drive bottom-line results.</p><p> <strong>  THEN:  </strong> Seniority Ruled</p><p> The world of command and control was generally inhabited by the tenured members of the organization: leaders who had earned their stripes through years of work and had reached an age of seniority and presumed wisdom. They held positions of authority and were revered (generally) by newcomers to their organizations&mdash;the young, inexperienced ranks whose youth put them at a decided disadvantage in terms of the perceived value of their intellectual contributions. But that was then.</p><p> <strong>  NOW: </strong>  Gen Y Presents Significant Opportunity</p><p> In the 21st century everyone is a knowledge worker&mdash;especially  <br/> Gen Y. Employees aren&rsquo;t valued as much for their years of service as they are for their brains. And, in a competitive global economy, success means capitalizing on the ingenuity of diverse brain power!</p><p> Unfortunately, just as the demand for intellectual capital is exploding, employers are faced with an imminent exodus of knowledge. As Baby Boomers begin to leave the workforce, who will be poised to take their place? Gen Y. This cohort represents the vast bulk of highly relevant and employable available knowledge &ldquo;talent.&rdquo; Ignore them at your peril.</p><p> Gen Y comprises more than 27 percent of the American population and nearly 25 percent of the American workforce today. These individuals will comprise more than 75 percent of the global workforce by 2025 and are already having a disproportionate influence on the workplace. Gen Y is different. They have more comfort with technology; no confidence that loyalty to a corporate culture will pay off for them, as it did not for their parents; greater comfort and familiarity with different ethnic groups since 46 percent of Gen Y are multicultural; limited patience with the status quo, much like Boomers who wanted to change the world; and a driving need to be included and participate.</p><p> Fail to include this cohort and the results could be highly detrimental to your organization. In 2013, a survey conducted by Beyond.com found that more than 60 percent of Millennials are leaving the companies they work for in less than three years <a href=\"///C:/Users/Linda/Desktop/INCLUSION%20WHITE%20PAPER%20%231.docx#_ftn1\">  [1] </a> . Why? The greatest reason given is &ldquo;cultural fit.&rdquo; The message to leaders: be inclusive.</p><p> <strong>  THEN: </strong>  Business Was Local</p><p> In days gone by, people did business locally. They shopped at the corner store. They ate at &ldquo;mom and pop&rdquo; restaurants. In the 1960s, if you asked 100 people from around the world where cars were made, they&rsquo;d likely say &ldquo;the United States.&rdquo; We were a US-centric economy.</p><p> As transportation and technology connected the world and made it &ldquo;smaller,&rdquo; companies began to sell their goods and services to broader markets&mdash;often global markets. But back then, what they sold globally looked very much like what they sold locally and it worked at the time. Years ago, American companies like McDonald&rsquo;s created products that catered to American appetites and the rest of the world literally ate them up. That was then.</p><p> <strong>  NOW:  </strong> Business is Global</p><p> Today, while there is certainly still a demand for American culture and American products, developing countries also want to consume goods and services that reflect their own local tastes. The increased ability of domestic companies to give them just that means America&rsquo;s monopoly on consumers is a thing of the past. Global businesses now require leaders who are culturally aware and culturally agile.</p><p> Technology, of course, has fueled the global economy. It is no longer necessary for organizations to be physical, bricks and mortar entities or to exist within clearly defined geographic boundaries. Organizations can be virtual. Companies can be headquartered in relatively small locales yet still operate globally. They can literally do business from anywhere&mdash;and so can their customers. Successful organizations in the global economy are those that best understand these customers, in all of their rich diversity.</p><p> <strong>  THEN:  </strong> Your Employees and Your Customers Looked Like You</p><p> Take a look at company photos from days gone by and you&rsquo;re likely to be struck by the sameness of the individuals in these photos. This was, of course, the impetus for an eventual focus on the need for diversity&mdash;the recognition that organizations were hampered by their sameness, by the lack of females and people of color. That led to the numbers game that we called &ldquo;diversity initiatives&rdquo;&mdash;the focus on attracting more women and people of color. It wasn&rsquo;t a bad approach; it just didn&rsquo;t go far enough or focus on what mattered most&mdash;inclusion as a driver for business. But, that was then.</p><p> <strong>  NOW: </strong>  They Don&rsquo;t Look Like You Anymore!</p><p> Today, the best companies are comprised of a wide range of people inside (employees) and outside (customers). America&rsquo;s traditional &ldquo;majority&rdquo; is becoming the &ldquo;minority.&rdquo; The most recent Census Bureau data indicates that, for the first time, the majority of Americans under the age of one are minorities. Today, 35 of the top 50 metros in the U.S. are majority minorities for kids five and under. In eight of these metros, it&rsquo;s greater than 75 percent. They don&rsquo;t look like you anymore, because there is no you. Instead, there is a rapidly growing amalgam of we&mdash;a society populated by diverse individuals based on a wide range of characteristics including sex, age, race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation. How do we get our arms around these changing demographics? It starts by cultivating inclusive leaders who can take their organizations successfully into the increasingly diverse and volatile 21st century.</p><p> These significant changes have created an entirely different leadership challenge for businesses today. It is an environment that is marked by the need to ensure that the voices of both employees and customers are valued and heard.</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-13 18:13:35.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-13 18:13:35.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_TkfEnP8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/then-and-now-its-not-your-mama-or-daddys-workplace/\", \"post_id\": \"6738\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-13 18:13:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-13 18:13:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"then-and-now-its-not-your-mama-or-daddys-workplace\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6739\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3102\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pexels-photo-large_2.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"750\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444850100,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}

He and co-founder Paul Binun collaborated over the next several years until they discovered a laser wavelength that could melt right through any hair color.</p><p> The razor runs on one AAA battery, which the company says will power the device for 50,000 hours of shaving satisfaction.

{"original_id":3016,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Valuing Your Time?","link":"are-you-valuing-your-time","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When I began in sales, I was told that to make a sale I would need to demonstrate that the client would save time and money. For further emphasis, it was stated that time is money.   There is much truth to these words.</p><p> Fast forward to entrepreneurship, from the start we are advised to offer free services as a demonstration of what we may provide in full. Along with most everyone I knew at the time, I followed the advice. But it went deeply against the grain of what I knew in the corporate sales arena. I always sold value that included impeccable customer service. This combination is what had my clients returning for more.</p><h3> Value You Bring</h3><p> <br/> The point to keep in mind as you move forward with entrepreneurial success or even in your career is to value the knowledge you do have. From prior experience, you possess unique perspective and approach for your endeavor. While it&rsquo;s true someone else may have been in business longer, they do not necessarily know everything you do. Put a value on your unique knowledge.</p><p> As a community service gesture, offer to answer questions via email or on social media sites. The questions provide deeper understanding of what your audience needs and desires. The questions may also point you to developing a new product or service.</p><h3> Time Spent</h3><p> <br/> The note of caution comes to long-winded telephone conversations or attending events where you know full well your desired audience will not be found. Many people will justify doing so because being seen is essential for getting known. The flaw in this line of thinking is that we have so many ways today to be seen and heard without the expense that it all comes back to valuing your time and putting a price on it.</p><h3> Win-Win</h3><p> <br/> Reciprocity is a keyword that is frequently used in reference to reposting for those who repost for you. But in terms of you valuing your time, reciprocity needs to kick in where projects are concerned so that everyone wins with some type of remuneration. Doing business should never be one-sided. Even if you are a newbie in your field, if someone wants to work with you, there is something they see in you that is of value to them. And it is that value that should bring in the remuneration.</p><h3> Recalculate</h3><p> <br/> As you progress, make it a habit every six months to review the value you bring and the worth it provides others.

There was a general consensus at the leadership level that significant change initiatives over the years had eroded employee understanding of the company&rsquo;s vision and values. They worried that people didn&rsquo;t really know what business they were in, and that this lack of understanding was leading to issues of disengagement and turnover.</p><p> I interviewed dozens of employees at every level over several weeks, but there was one young lady that stood out. So much so that our videotaped interview with her became the inspiration and keystone in our resulting engagement campaign. She was a young salesperson running a high-volume store in NYC, selling women&rsquo;s apparel to the thousands of young professionals who passed through the store every week. She was good at her job, and clearly passionate about it. When asked why she loved her job, she replied simply: &ldquo;Because I get to change people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p><p> A bold statement for a young salesperson to make. She went on to explain that it made her proud when her customer stopped into her store to tell her how she had changed their lives: like the woman who bought the suit, that made a good impression in the interview, where she landed the job that would help her build a better life for her family, or the woman who found the perfect dress for the party, that gave her the confidence to speak to the man who would become her fianc&eacute; and the love of her life.</p><p> This young salesperson did not see herself in the business of selling clothes. She saw herself in the business of changing lives. That was her why. Her how was to spend her life preparing her customers to improve theirs. It just so happened that she used fashion-forward outfits to do it.</p><p> I was reminded of this young women when I read Bruce Pfau&rsquo;s insightful  <u>  <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2015/10/how-an-accounting-firm-convinced-its-employees-they-could-change-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u>  yesterday in the Harvard Business Review, &ldquo;How an Accounting Firm Convinced Its Employees They Could Change the World.&rdquo; As KPMG launched their purpose-driven brand, they abandoned an initially academic focus to encourage their employees to tell their own stories, in their own words.</p><p> As Pauf explained, &ldquo;we recognized that just telling people from the top down about their higher purpose would not succeed. We encouraged everyone&mdash;from our interns to our Chairman&mdash;to share their own stories about how their work is making a difference.&rdquo;</p><p> And employees did &mdash; in overwhelming numbers. With a team of 27,000 partners and employees worldwide, KPMG received over 42,000 stories from employees celebrating the difference they make in the lives of their clients, communities and society as a whole. Six months into their purpose initiative, 76% of KPMG&rsquo;s employees said their &ldquo;job had special meaning (and was not just a job),&rdquo; six points higher than the average of their &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; accounting firm competitors and a four-point jump year over year.</p><p> Employees &ndash; especially those in direct contact with the customer &ndash; generally have a very clear understanding of what business they are really in. Whether your employees are selling suits on the floor of a clothing shop, or certifying the results of a highly contentious national election (as KPMG did in South Africa) their purpose is personal, and the best way for leaders to discover it is not to talk &hellip; but to listen.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-13 18:42:22.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-13 18:42:22.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_nUfMZ3k.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-to-discovering-the-business-youre-in/\", \"post_id\": \"6747\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-13 18:42:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-13 18:42:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-to-discovering-the-business-youre-in\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6746\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3106\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fashion-person-woman-girl-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"449\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444825800,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}

Because I had the extraordinary gift of early college mentors who helped me grasp that relationships are vastly important. By the time I launched my own company, I had 15 years invested into a solid network of relationships and contacts. That&rsquo;s worth gold.</p><h3> Be reliable.</h3><p> <br/> People hate other flaky people. If you promise you&rsquo;ll do something, do it. If you say you&rsquo;ll be somewhere, be there. And when life happens, communicate clearly so people know you value the relationship even though your plans changed. Running late? Send a text. Need an extra day on the project? Drop an email so they can plan for it.</p><p> When you screw up, take ownership and make it right. When people know they can rely on you, you become a trusted asset &mdash; even though you make mistakes now and then.</p><h3> Be humble.</h3><p> <br/> Make yourself indispensable. <br/> Think of yourself as totally dispensable.</p><p> The moment you start to believe they can&rsquo;t survive without you, your attitude changes and people can tell. You may well be the backbone of the entire team, but there&rsquo;s no reason to flaunt it. Stay rooted in humility, without losing confidence.</p><h3> Be excellent.</h3><p> <br/> Excellence is more than just job performance. Excellence doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll never make a mistake. It just means that you never settle for mediocre when you know you can do better. Being excellent also flows into how you work through tough challenges (resourcefulness) , how you treat people (relationality) , how you manage shifting priorities (reliability) , and how you handle your own success (humility) .</p><h3> Be resourceful. <br/> Be relational. <br/> Be reliable. <br/> Be humble. <br/> Be excellent.</h3><p> <br/> In short, if you&rsquo;re a young entrepreneur or business leader and you dream of long-term success: take purposeful care of your relationships and your reputation.</p><p> Combine quality character with business savvy, and clients will clamor to work with you.</p>  ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2015-10-13 18:47:56.000000","last_updated":"2015-10-13 18:47:56.000000","image_url":"2015/10/article_placeholder_UWFfB45.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-critical-characteristics-every-young-entrepreneur-should-cultivate/\", \"post_id\": \"6749\", \"post_date\": \"2015-10-13 18:47:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2015-10-13 18:47:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-critical-characteristics-every-young-entrepreneur-should-cultivate\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"6748\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"3107\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sunglasses-hand-smartphone-desk-large.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"930\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"deal-or-no-deal-it-is-really-that-simple-to-begin-with\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/09/7-ways-to-be-an-effective-social-seller/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"enclosure\": \"https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6ba15tydynd91t/Decide%20Now.mov?dl=0\\n\\n0\\n\\nvideo/quicktime\", \"custom_permalink\": \"development/20-ways-improve-your-performance-work\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"71\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1444842000,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}
