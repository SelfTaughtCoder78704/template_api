As a teenager, I spent my summer&apos;s working on a relative&apos;s dairy farm, tending livestock and helping with the haying season. When I was 17 my Uncle was hurt in an accident on the farm, I left school for few weeks to take over his responsibilities on the farm. Running a farm involves a lot of risk from uncooperative weather, livestock issues and more. I remember every day we would listen closely to the radio at lunch for the current prices were for livestock. There is nothing easy about being a farmer. There is nothing easy about running any business. There is nothing easy about running your business. I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve ever considered the realities of owning and operating a blue-collar business like yours, they aren&apos;t that much different from a dairy farmer&apos;s business and their inherent risks. Farmers fear bad weather and disease and market prices for livestock and crops, these are unpredictable events but they are known events (probabilities). They can plan ahead as best they can. What I&apos;ve seen many times with many blue-collar businesses is that they often don&apos;t know how to or take the time to plan for unknown events and how it may impact their businesses. There&apos;s the risk of injury, sickness or even holding onto a business for too long.

Over this time, he has observed that many medical problems and physical symptoms arise from our ability or inability to effectively manage the challenges of everyday life. In 2002, he became the tenth doctor in the US to form what is known as a concierge or patient-focused practice. Such a practice has permitted him time to explore how stress interferes with our ability to obtain optimal, holistic health—balancing mind, body, and spirit. His first book, the award winning and Amazon category bestseller Brain Drain, is a handbook on how to overcome common roadblocks to success and a joyful deeply meaningful life.

Following three years as a high school English teacher, George obtained a real estate license and embarked on a business career, later adding insurance to his growing list of services. His experiences in these industries led him to realize that people need help in many areas of their lives—not just managing real estate transactions and procuring insurance—leading him to his focus on investment management, tax planning, estate planning, and income planning. George earned his designation as a <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cfp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Certified Financial Planner® (CFP®)  </a> </u> in 1984.

Diamond Consultants was no longer the small business it was when his wife Mindy started it on their bedroom floor in 1998. It was growing and in need of someone to run the day-to-day operations. So Howard found himself in the new role of Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel for Diamond Consultants.</p><p> The transition proved to be a fairly easy one for Howard. In his former world, his role was to counsel and advocate on behalf of his clients; now he is managing an organization that also counsels and advocates on the clients&apos; behalf, although it&apos;s specifically towards growth in the financial world. And his legal background has certainly not been put to rest: he regularly counsels on contractual agreements for the firm and their clients.

After leaving Merrill in 2005, he was introduced to the RIA marketplace a few years later when he helped build the infrastructure for Luminous Capital prior to its founding in 2008. As COO and CCO at Luminous, he navigated the technology and compliance challenges as the firm grew from $1.7 billion in assets to nearly $6 billion in less than five years. Luminous Capital sold to First Republic Bank for more than $100 million in 2012, after which Matt headed to Focus Financial Partners in New York City. There, he helped breakaway teams and recently-formed RIAs develop strategic initiatives to benefit from best practices, streamline operations, and improve efficiency before heading back to California to launch PFI Advisors with his wife and business partner.

In 2001, he founded the &ldquo;It&#39;s a Habit!&quot; Company and co-created children&#39;s storybook character Sammy Rabbit to make it easy for anyone to talk to and teach children about great money habits early! Sam has written and produced one of the largest libraries in the world of financial literacy stories and songs that include Sammy&#39;s Big Dream, Get in the Habit, S.A.V.E. and more. What makes it astonishing is Sam cannot sing on key or clap on beat. His exemplary work in 8 countries with more than a quarter million children has resulted in multiple honors for himself and others, including the New Jersey Coalition for Financial Education Muriel F. Siebert Lifetime Achievement Award. His efforts have been chronicled by a variety of media including NPR, MSN, the Armed Forces Network, etc. Kiplinger editor, Janet Bodnar wrote this about the visionary innovator: &quot;Anyone who has ever had a hard time trying to persuade a group of 7 year old children that saving money is fun, should invite Sam Renick for dinner. Renick can whip a gym full of elementary school kids into a frenzy of enthusiasm for saving money minutes after bounding into the room.&quot; For Renick, the mission is personal. That makes an enormous difference. His passion &amp; enthusiasm are contagious! Talk with him and you get it He&#39;s an evergreen &amp; ever-giving source of education and empowerment.
